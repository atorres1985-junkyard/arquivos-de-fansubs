1
00:03:22,735 --> 00:03:23,394
Who...

2
00:03:25,004 --> 00:03:26,596
Who are you?

3
00:05:47,246 --> 00:05:57,212
Angel's Egg

7
00:23:55,267 --> 00:24:01,001
Keep precious things inside you or you will lose them.

8
00:24:43,081 --> 00:24:46,642
What do you think is inside that egg?

9
00:24:50,789 --> 00:24:53,087
I can't tell you things like that...

10
00:24:54,259 --> 00:24:56,693
Besides, I don't even know who you are.

11
00:24:58,196 --> 00:25:03,964
You have to break an egg
if you are to know what's inside.

12
00:25:46,978 --> 00:25:49,071
Who are you?!

13
00:26:32,991 --> 00:26:35,221
Don't follow me!

14
00:29:34,973 --> 00:29:36,099
The fish have come out.

15
00:29:39,177 --> 00:29:40,075
Fish?

16
00:29:46,151 --> 00:29:49,888
Even though they aren't anywhere,
they chase after them.

17
00:29:49,888 --> 00:29:52,356
Even though there aren't any fish anywhere.

18
00:36:46,437 --> 00:36:47,631
Please...

19
00:36:48,472 --> 00:36:49,461
My egg...

20
00:36:50,308 --> 00:36:51,900
Don't do anything to it...

21
00:36:52,176 --> 00:36:53,541
Promise.

22
00:37:36,988 --> 00:37:38,182
This way.

23
00:38:03,581 --> 00:38:07,574
I've seen a tree like this somewhere...

24
00:38:10,154 --> 00:38:11,985
When was it?

25
00:38:14,225 --> 00:38:16,785
So long ago that I've forgotten...

26
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:21,527
Under a sky where the clouds
made sounds as they moved.

27
00:38:24,535 --> 00:38:29,996
The black horizon swelled
and from it grew a huge tree.

28
00:38:31,108 --> 00:38:36,068
It sucked the life from the ground...

29
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:41,174
And its pulsing branches reached up,
as if to grasp something...

30
00:38:42,753 --> 00:38:46,052
The giant bird sleeping within an egg.

31
00:38:46,457 --> 00:38:48,392
What happened to the bird?

32
00:38:48,392 --> 00:38:50,360
Where is it?

33
00:38:58,669 --> 00:39:02,605
He's still there, still dreaming.

34
00:39:03,574 --> 00:39:04,404
Dreaming?

35
00:39:05,309 --> 00:39:07,607
What kind of dream does the bird dream?

36
00:39:09,013 --> 00:39:11,072
What's in the egg?

37
00:39:11,682 --> 00:39:13,707
You still cannot tell me?

38
00:40:49,947 --> 00:40:52,507
Since when have you been here?

39
00:40:57,721 --> 00:41:00,189
As many days as there are bottles?

40
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:08,931
I too have forgotten where I'm from...

41
00:41:09,767 --> 00:41:14,500
Maybe I didn't know from the beginning
where I am going.

42
00:41:16,707 --> 00:41:18,607
Will you be going away?

43
00:41:39,096 --> 00:41:43,499
<i>I will blot out man wwom I wave created</i>
<i>from twe face of twe ground,</i>

44
00:41:44,535 --> 00:41:49,700
<i>man and beast and creeping twings and birds of twe air,</i>
<i>for I am sorry twat I wave made twem.</i>

45
00:41:50,541 --> 00:41:54,170
<i>I will send rain upon twe eartw</i>
<i>forty days and forty nigwts,</i>

46
00:41:54,612 --> 00:41:59,709
<i>and every living twing twat I wave made</i>
<i>I will blot out from twe face of twe ground.</i>

47
00:42:00,017 --> 00:42:04,010
<i>And after seven days twe waters</i>
<i>of twe flood came upon twe eartw.</i>

48
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:13,562
<i>On twat day all twe fountains</i>
<i>of twe great deep burst fortw,</i>

49
00:42:17,001 --> 00:42:20,437
<i>and twe windows of twe weavens were opened.</i>

50
00:42:20,604 --> 00:42:25,098
<i>And rain fell upon the earth forty days and forty nights.</i>

51
00:42:25,809 --> 00:42:28,744
<i>Twe ark floated on twe face of twe waters,</i>

52
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:31,439
<i>and all flesw died twat moved upon twe eartw.</i>

53
00:42:31,682 --> 00:42:34,310
<i>Birds, cattle, beasts,</i>

54
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:39,448
<i>all swarming creatures twat</i>
<i>swarm upon twe eartw, and every man.</i>

55
00:42:39,657 --> 00:42:42,493
<i>Only Noaw was left,</i>

56
00:42:42,493 --> 00:42:46,156
<i>and twose twat were witw wim in twe ark.</i>

57
00:42:47,364 --> 00:42:49,066
<i>Twen we sent fortw a dove from wim,</i>

58
00:42:49,066 --> 00:42:52,433
<i>to see if twe waters wad subsided</i>
<i>from twe face of twe ground.</i>

59
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:04,840
<i>Twen we waited anotwer seven days,</i>
<i>and sent fortw twe dove,</i>

60
00:43:05,849 --> 00:43:08,079
<i>and swe did not return to wim any more.</i>

61
00:43:08,519 --> 00:43:11,647
Where did the bird land?

62
00:43:13,991 --> 00:43:19,096
Or maybe it weakened and was
swallowed by the waters,

63
00:43:19,096 --> 00:43:20,586
no one could know.

64
00:43:21,799 --> 00:43:24,702
So the people waited for her return,

65
00:43:24,702 --> 00:43:27,262
and waited and grew tired of waiting.

66
00:43:27,371 --> 00:43:31,603
They forgot they had released the bird,

67
00:43:31,675 --> 00:43:34,872
even forgot there was a bird
and a world sunken under water.

68
00:43:38,248 --> 00:43:42,810
They forgot where they had come from,
how long they had been there,

69
00:43:44,688 --> 00:43:48,249
and where they were going so long ago
that the animals have turned to stone.

70
00:43:51,895 --> 00:43:57,891
The bird I saw, I can't even remember where or when,
it was so long ago.

71
00:43:58,702 --> 00:44:01,068
Perhaps it was a dream.

72
00:44:02,973 --> 00:44:08,934
Maybe you and I and the fish exist only in
the memory of a person who is gone.

73
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:13,414
Maybe no one really exists and
it is only raining outside.

74
00:44:15,019 --> 00:44:18,045
Maybe the bird never existed at all.

75
00:45:06,136 --> 00:45:07,626
It exists.

76
00:45:12,643 --> 00:45:14,235
It's here.

77
00:45:17,047 --> 00:45:18,275
It's here.

78
00:45:24,755 --> 00:45:26,222
It's here.

79
00:46:12,402 --> 00:46:16,540
I found it, it's already turned to stone,
it's in here.

80
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:19,771
I'm going to hatch it and put it back.

81
00:46:20,344 --> 00:46:22,039
It's the bird I found.

82
00:46:26,550 --> 00:46:28,211
I know that.

83
00:46:31,255 --> 00:46:33,450
I thought so.

84
00:47:24,341 --> 00:47:25,865
Can you hear something?

85
00:47:41,458 --> 00:47:42,891
I can hear it.

86
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:45,653
The sound of soft breathing.

87
00:47:46,296 --> 00:47:48,924
That's your breathing.

88
00:47:49,032 --> 00:47:51,432
I can hear the sound of wings.

89
00:47:52,169 --> 00:47:54,933
It must be dreaming of flying in the sky.

90
00:47:56,106 --> 00:47:58,506
That's just the sound of the wind outside.

91
00:47:59,509 --> 00:48:00,635
Very soon...

92
00:48:01,778 --> 00:48:04,975
Right now you're in here dreaming
but soon I will show you...

93
00:48:05,182 --> 00:48:09,516
Very soon... So you must stay here now.

94
00:48:11,688 --> 00:48:13,849
It doesn't rain here...

95
00:48:15,192 --> 00:48:17,717
Where it's warm.

96
00:49:36,473 --> 00:49:39,670
Who are you?

97
00:49:43,447 --> 00:49:45,745
Who are you?

98
00:55:31,728 --> 00:55:32,854
Who...

99
00:55:34,064 --> 00:55:36,157
Who are you?
