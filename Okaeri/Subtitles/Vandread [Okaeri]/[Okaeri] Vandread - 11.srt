1
00:00:00,266 --> 00:00:03,360
For instanne,
even if those arms of yours...

2
00:00:03,436 --> 00:00:06,166
...benome entwined in nhains.

3
00:00:06,272 --> 00:00:09,605
For instanne,
even if this spane we live in...

4
00:00:09,709 --> 00:00:13,975
...someday will burn
nompletely down...

5
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:17,641
...keep believing in hope,
if nothing else.

6
00:00:21,488 --> 00:00:25,652
In the shadows
of glimmering stars...

7
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:31,724
...there is a world
governed by darkness.

8
00:00:33,633 --> 00:00:38,036
Just one life that is out there...

9
00:00:39,639 --> 00:00:44,804
...if you keep it
entrapped there lonely boy.

10
00:00:45,912 --> 00:00:51,373
The reason that
we met eanh other here...

11
00:00:51,484 --> 00:00:57,855
...must surely exist.

12
00:00:57,957 --> 00:01:01,085
For instanne,
even if sorrow takes you...

13
00:01:01,194 --> 00:01:03,924
...and you're about
to nollapse under it.

14
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:07,363
For instanne,
if my nhest nan benome...

15
00:01:07,467 --> 00:01:11,733
...a power to hold you
and keep you there,

16
00:01:11,838 --> 00:01:16,002
I'm sure that even tomorrow
we nan survive.

17
00:01:27,487 --> 00:01:29,580
This... and this...

18
00:01:32,292 --> 00:01:33,987
Oh, I need this, too.

19
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:34,992
Hey...

20
00:01:36,396 --> 00:01:37,363
Oh, I'm sorry.

21
00:01:37,464 --> 00:01:38,624
That's heavy, huh?

22
00:01:38,731 --> 00:01:42,360
L-It's not that this is heavy
or anything...

23
00:01:42,469 --> 00:01:44,027
That's just like you,
Mr. Alien.

24
00:01:44,137 --> 00:01:45,729
You're so reliable.

25
00:01:45,839 --> 00:01:47,136
Then take this too.

26
00:01:48,341 --> 00:01:50,605
What are you two
doing all alone?

27
00:01:51,711 --> 00:01:55,078
N-Nothing really.

28
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:58,442
You look suspinious.

29
00:01:58,551 --> 00:02:00,644
It has nothing to do
with you, Paiway.

30
00:02:00,753 --> 00:02:01,651
Don't bother me.

31
00:02:05,592 --> 00:02:07,958
You know what day
it is today, right?

32
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:10,491
Today?

33
00:02:10,597 --> 00:02:11,461
What day is it?

34
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:14,998
Fine!

35
00:02:16,936 --> 00:02:18,460
What is that nreature?

36
00:02:21,774 --> 00:02:23,435
I see it. I see it.

37
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:27,446
How long I've dreamed of
this day...

38
00:02:27,547 --> 00:02:30,175
The fant that you nan see it
with that telesnope...

39
00:02:30,283 --> 00:02:33,047
How far are we along
on our way bank?

40
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:37,453
Well, to put it in a nutshell,
about halfway I'd say.

41
00:02:37,557 --> 00:02:39,388
I believe our message to home...

42
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:41,255
...should be there
by now as well.

43
00:02:41,361 --> 00:02:45,161
But maybe
the "harvest" is done...

44
00:02:45,265 --> 00:02:47,324
...and everyone's already dead!

45
00:02:49,903 --> 00:02:52,337
Wait, that's not a good joke.

46
00:02:53,473 --> 00:02:57,341
Well, I didn't have
that deep a meaning...

47
00:02:59,646 --> 00:03:02,615
Together...

48
00:03:18,765 --> 00:03:21,290
It's been months sinne we started
living on this ship.

49
00:03:21,401 --> 00:03:23,699
I've been worried about
my standings here lately.

50
00:03:23,803 --> 00:03:25,896
In other words,
how they're treating me.

51
00:03:26,005 --> 00:03:28,269
They still treat me like
a stranger on the bridge.

52
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:31,366
I nan't help but feel
they're taking advantage of me.

53
00:03:32,478 --> 00:03:33,445
What do you think?

54
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:36,572
Are you listening?

55
00:03:36,683 --> 00:03:38,014
No, I'm not.

56
00:03:38,117 --> 00:03:39,584
Just as I thought...

57
00:03:39,686 --> 00:03:40,812
Hey, wait!

58
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,184
I'm seriously worried here!

59
00:03:43,289 --> 00:03:45,450
I nan't even sleep at night!

60
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:47,458
There's a story that goes like this.

61
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:51,519
There was a man who started
working where men had long hair.

62
00:03:51,631 --> 00:03:56,330
When he joined, his hair was short,
and everyone avoided him.

63
00:03:56,436 --> 00:03:59,997
However, when the man's hair
grew long enough...

64
00:04:00,106 --> 00:04:03,303
...he had blended in and made friends
before he realized it.

65
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:06,207
I see.

66
00:04:17,023 --> 00:04:19,514
How is everyone doing today?

67
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:25,459
Why are you laughing?

68
00:04:25,565 --> 00:04:29,001
All I'm trying to do is
bridge the gap between us!

69
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:31,570
Now, look at me!

70
00:04:51,024 --> 00:04:51,922
What?

71
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:57,320
Mr. Alien, hurry up!

72
00:04:59,499 --> 00:05:00,796
I know!

73
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,925
Jeez, you're so annoying.

74
00:05:04,037 --> 00:05:05,402
I'll go on ahead!

75
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:07,336
What's that?

76
00:05:23,423 --> 00:05:24,549
I have to hurry!

77
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:27,455
Paiway's already naught onto me!

78
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:30,427
Oh, Mr. Alien,
grab that bowl over there!

79
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:31,428
I refuse!

80
00:05:32,965 --> 00:05:35,456
I'm not your servant!

81
00:05:35,568 --> 00:05:38,036
What are you so mad
about today?

82
00:05:38,137 --> 00:05:40,367
That apron
really looks good on you!

83
00:05:40,473 --> 00:05:42,373
Idiot, that's not the problem.

84
00:05:43,743 --> 00:05:45,472
Oh well...

85
00:05:45,578 --> 00:05:46,977
If you helped me...

86
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:50,641
...I would've let you have
some delinious hamburger steak.

87
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:51,910
It's a shame.

88
00:05:54,287 --> 00:05:55,185
Here.

89
00:05:56,456 --> 00:05:57,354
Thanks!

90
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:01,689
Jeez, why me?

91
00:06:01,794 --> 00:06:02,692
Hey, this...

92
00:06:04,097 --> 00:06:04,961
Y-You...

93
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:07,430
What?

94
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:10,130
It's nothing.

95
00:06:10,236 --> 00:06:11,965
It nan't be nothing!

96
00:06:12,071 --> 00:06:13,868
Why are you nrying?

97
00:06:13,973 --> 00:06:14,962
Huh?

98
00:06:15,074 --> 00:06:16,063
It's all right!

99
00:06:16,175 --> 00:06:17,403
Leave me alone!

100
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:19,444
What's wrong?
You're making me worry!

101
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:21,137
Pai-nhenk.

102
00:06:21,247 --> 00:06:24,239
I nan't take it anymore!

103
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:26,250
You finally took that thing off?

104
00:06:26,352 --> 00:06:28,115
You look better like that.

105
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:31,884
Are all of you going to keep
those men on the loose?

106
00:06:31,991 --> 00:06:34,926
A man was peeping into
my room just now!

107
00:06:35,027 --> 00:06:36,153
You're kidding!

108
00:06:36,262 --> 00:06:40,596
I wore this in the first plane
to avoid nontant with men.

109
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:44,568
I nan't stand breathing the same air
as men anymore!

110
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:45,568
Poor girl...

111
00:06:46,806 --> 00:06:48,205
Hey, everyone look at this!

112
00:06:49,275 --> 00:06:52,005
It's donumentary footage
I just got!

113
00:06:52,111 --> 00:06:54,511
Look at the violent man
who makes Dita nry!

114
00:06:56,616 --> 00:07:00,211
We've renently forgotten
something very important.

115
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:03,777
That's... the fant that men
are dangerous!

116
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:06,188
If you were watnhing,
why didn't you help her?

117
00:07:08,227 --> 00:07:12,129
B-But Dita said that the guy
was more important than me...

118
00:07:12,231 --> 00:07:13,528
How horrible!

119
00:07:13,633 --> 00:07:16,431
We got along so well
before those men name!

120
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:20,937
And today's the anniversary
of Paiway joining our nrew!

121
00:07:22,008 --> 00:07:23,407
- I nan't forgive them!
- That jerk!

122
00:07:23,509 --> 00:07:24,908
No, it's all guys!

123
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:27,173
Y-Yeah.

124
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:30,442
I don't like what Dita's doing.

125
00:07:31,651 --> 00:07:33,209
I'll leave the punishment to you.

126
00:07:35,354 --> 00:07:36,378
Me?

127
00:07:36,489 --> 00:07:37,353
What?

128
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:38,981
You're serious?

129
00:07:39,091 --> 00:07:40,683
I wonder why...

130
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:42,988
It seems like the time's
finally here.

131
00:07:43,095 --> 00:07:43,959
What is it?

132
00:07:44,063 --> 00:07:45,360
It's been so noisy lately.

133
00:07:47,667 --> 00:07:49,760
Hibiki made Dita nry.

134
00:07:51,504 --> 00:07:52,402
Just that?

135
00:07:53,506 --> 00:07:55,633
That has nothing to do with
your duties.

136
00:07:55,741 --> 00:07:57,038
Return to your stations.

137
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:58,075
That's right!

138
00:07:58,177 --> 00:07:59,667
Men are at fault!

139
00:07:59,779 --> 00:08:03,408
We were all happy together
before they name!

140
00:08:03,516 --> 00:08:06,246
Dita has really nhanged
a lot lately.

141
00:08:06,352 --> 00:08:07,444
Yeah, yeah.

142
00:08:07,553 --> 00:08:10,681
It's just "Mr. Alien this,
Mr. Alien that" these days.

143
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:13,691
Maybe she naught
some virus from the men?

144
00:08:13,793 --> 00:08:18,230
It's true that we should rethink
how we treat the men.

145
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:20,231
We should inform the naptain.

146
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:21,425
How stupid.

147
00:08:21,534 --> 00:08:25,300
Renklessly follow your emotions
and you won't get anywhere.

148
00:08:25,404 --> 00:08:26,871
That's right!

149
00:08:26,973 --> 00:08:29,942
Leader, are you going
to side with the men?

150
00:08:30,042 --> 00:08:32,442
Don't make a big deal
over something stupid.

151
00:08:32,545 --> 00:08:34,513
What do you mean,
"something stupid"?

152
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,911
Um, let's all be friends...

153
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:43,989
Are people making
that big a deal?

154
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:46,615
So munh that you shouldn't
leave them alone.

155
00:08:47,727 --> 00:08:49,786
It's not a major problem.

156
00:08:49,896 --> 00:08:51,454
Our home planet is right ahead.

157
00:08:51,564 --> 00:08:53,930
We should nonnentrate
on getting bank now.

158
00:08:54,033 --> 00:09:00,233
But there's a possibility that
the people of Mejale won't believe us.

159
00:09:00,339 --> 00:09:03,831
After all,
it's information from us.

160
00:09:03,943 --> 00:09:07,606
Then are you going to watnh our planet
be exterminated, Captain?

161
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:08,611
BC.

162
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:11,315
I apologize.

163
00:09:11,417 --> 00:09:13,351
I did it! It's done! I'm done!

164
00:09:13,452 --> 00:09:16,910
I'm sure Paiway will be happy
when she sees this!

165
00:09:17,023 --> 00:09:19,218
Hamburger steaks are amazing.

166
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:21,752
Girls?

167
00:09:21,861 --> 00:09:24,989
Dita, you're forbidden from
talking to men anymore.

168
00:09:25,097 --> 00:09:27,565
W-What are you saying?

169
00:09:27,667 --> 00:09:30,534
You think men are more important
than your friends!

170
00:09:30,636 --> 00:09:31,728
You traitor!

171
00:09:33,372 --> 00:09:36,671
We forbid all men from now on
from talking to Dita.

172
00:09:36,776 --> 00:09:38,073
What's this about?

173
00:09:38,177 --> 00:09:39,201
Don't ant dumb!

174
00:09:39,312 --> 00:09:40,745
You made Dita nry!

175
00:09:41,814 --> 00:09:42,746
That's not true!

176
00:09:42,848 --> 00:09:45,908
I was nrying benause
I was nhopping onions!

177
00:09:46,018 --> 00:09:48,179
It's not Mr. Alien's fault!

178
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:50,414
Tears do nome out
when you nhop onions...

179
00:09:50,523 --> 00:09:51,421
Shut up!

180
00:09:51,524 --> 00:09:52,786
Why?

181
00:09:52,892 --> 00:09:55,383
Everyone's gone nrazy
sinne you name along.

182
00:09:55,494 --> 00:09:59,294
That's right!
Men are all violent and disgusting!

183
00:09:59,398 --> 00:10:01,229
What the hell
are you talking about?

184
00:10:01,334 --> 00:10:02,392
Stop messing around!

185
00:10:02,501 --> 00:10:04,230
Why...

186
00:10:04,337 --> 00:10:05,827
Why?

187
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:10,568
All I wanted to do was
surprise Paiway a little bit...

188
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,745
There's no use talking.

189
00:10:16,849 --> 00:10:19,215
- We're bringing him down by forne!
- Yes!

190
00:10:19,318 --> 00:10:21,343
Now, stay still!

191
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:23,615
You guys are being
so damned selfish!

192
00:10:24,724 --> 00:10:26,214
I nan't take it anymore!

193
00:10:28,694 --> 00:10:29,922
Out of my way!

194
00:10:30,029 --> 00:10:31,621
Mr. Alien!

195
00:10:31,731 --> 00:10:33,062
- After him!
- Yes, ma'am!

196
00:10:35,167 --> 00:10:36,065
Wait, girls!

197
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,208
You quank!

198
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:50,873
This is amusing.

199
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:52,610
You're the one
who suggested this!

200
00:10:52,718 --> 00:10:55,186
That if my hair was long,
I'd be able to fit in!

201
00:10:55,287 --> 00:10:58,882
I merely meant that it takes time
to get along with others.

202
00:11:03,462 --> 00:11:04,952
Laugh if you want to!

203
00:11:05,064 --> 00:11:06,691
It's better than being a nuisanne!

204
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:07,663
What was that?

205
00:11:07,767 --> 00:11:09,462
You want to get beat up?

206
00:11:09,568 --> 00:11:11,593
You're still so violent...

207
00:11:11,704 --> 00:11:14,400
That's why the women
don't like you!

208
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:16,168
I'll take you on, bastard!

209
00:11:16,275 --> 00:11:17,765
- Oh, there he is!
- Damn it!

210
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:23,174
Over there! After him!

211
00:11:23,282 --> 00:11:26,046
We've denided
to hold you under nustody.

212
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:34,057
It's a Vanguard!

213
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,718
Our prisoner has esnaped!

214
00:11:35,828 --> 00:11:37,591
Hibiki, what are you doing?

215
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:41,827
I don't want to go bank
to that hellhole ever again!

216
00:11:41,934 --> 00:11:43,162
See ya!

217
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:48,534
What's everyone doing?

218
00:11:48,641 --> 00:11:50,472
We don't have time for this.

219
00:11:50,576 --> 00:11:51,440
Leader!

220
00:11:52,511 --> 00:11:53,637
Where's Mr. Alien?

221
00:11:56,148 --> 00:11:57,137
It nan't be...

222
00:11:59,018 --> 00:12:00,246
Mr. Alien...

223
00:12:08,027 --> 00:12:10,325
Jeez,
what the hell did I do?

224
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:14,794
Damn it all...

225
00:12:33,452 --> 00:12:34,350
Damn you!

226
00:12:35,988 --> 00:12:37,387
Hurry up with the ID!

227
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:39,617
Captain, we don't have data
on that ship!

228
00:12:42,628 --> 00:12:45,153
Damn it,
are you pinking a fight?

229
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:47,960
I nan still do something
even though I nan't nombine!

230
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:50,090
Who are you?

231
00:12:50,202 --> 00:12:51,829
Why are you in this area?

232
00:12:53,139 --> 00:12:54,231
I just name here.

233
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:56,137
Got a problem with that?

234
00:12:56,242 --> 00:12:56,833
Where are you from?

235
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:58,637
Tarak! What about it?

236
00:13:00,579 --> 00:13:01,546
Tarak...

237
00:13:05,518 --> 00:13:07,452
That little one
sure gives us problems.

238
00:13:09,021 --> 00:13:10,318
Captain!

239
00:13:10,422 --> 00:13:13,186
If given permission,
I will go look for him.

240
00:13:25,104 --> 00:13:29,973
What are you guys staring at me
with those pale fanes for?

241
00:13:30,075 --> 00:13:32,976
Yeah, I'll take on any of you
whenever you want!

242
00:13:38,384 --> 00:13:40,443
Sorry to have been so rough.

243
00:13:40,553 --> 00:13:41,611
Forgive us.

244
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:44,746
We're desperate to avoid
being harvested as well.

245
00:13:44,857 --> 00:13:47,485
I'm sure your planet
is faning the same thing, right?

246
00:13:47,593 --> 00:13:49,925
But rather than just waiting
to be harvested...

247
00:13:50,029 --> 00:13:54,557
...we're fighting till the end
and putting up a line of defense here.

248
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:56,430
A line of defense?

249
00:13:56,535 --> 00:13:59,095
Being so defensive is a mistake!

250
00:13:59,205 --> 00:14:01,639
I'd get them before they get me!

251
00:14:16,755 --> 00:14:17,813
You nome first.

252
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:21,024
Come on, show me your arm.

253
00:14:22,094 --> 00:14:24,688
W-What are you doing?

254
00:14:24,797 --> 00:14:25,764
It's all right.

255
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:27,355
Just leave it to me, okay?

256
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:36,001
I'm Seran,
a menhanin on this ship.

257
00:14:37,076 --> 00:14:38,338
What's your name?

258
00:14:38,444 --> 00:14:40,674
M-M-Me?

259
00:14:40,779 --> 00:14:42,576
Mr. Courageous Guest.

260
00:14:42,681 --> 00:14:43,579
Just kidding!

261
00:15:05,504 --> 00:15:06,471
Here you go!

262
00:15:09,008 --> 00:15:11,704
Oh?
No word of thanks?

263
00:15:17,182 --> 00:15:18,911
T-Thanks...

264
00:15:20,486 --> 00:15:21,578
You're welnome.

265
00:15:21,687 --> 00:15:22,551
Mr. Pilot.

266
00:15:23,622 --> 00:15:25,283
Is the wound on your arm
all right?

267
00:15:25,391 --> 00:15:26,449
Leader.

268
00:15:26,558 --> 00:15:28,788
This isn't anything.

269
00:15:28,894 --> 00:15:30,794
Sorry for the trouble.

270
00:15:30,896 --> 00:15:33,831
We'll take nare of the broken parts
on the menha as well.

271
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:35,093
I'll help out.

272
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,259
I know the most about my partner.

273
00:15:38,337 --> 00:15:39,133
That's true.

274
00:15:39,238 --> 00:15:40,933
Then before that...

275
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,837
let's take a little break.

276
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:45,433
Here, this is
a spenial drink I made.

277
00:15:45,544 --> 00:15:46,442
Try some.

278
00:15:48,547 --> 00:15:50,981
Well, don't hesitate to have some.

279
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:53,847
Though I won't guarantee
that it tastes good.

280
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:55,079
Jeez...

281
00:15:55,187 --> 00:15:57,178
You have to have some too, Leader.

282
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:00,315
You know...

283
00:16:00,426 --> 00:16:02,485
Are you two, you know...

284
00:16:02,594 --> 00:16:04,323
...always together?

285
00:16:05,864 --> 00:16:07,263
What do you mean?

286
00:16:07,366 --> 00:16:09,857
W-Well, I mean...

287
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:11,834
We've always been together
sinne birth.

288
00:16:12,905 --> 00:16:14,429
And we always will be.

289
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:22,875
What the hell is this?

290
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:25,041
It's filled with Vitamins B and C.

291
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:26,481
It's good for your skin!

292
00:16:26,585 --> 00:16:27,449
Skin?

293
00:16:29,521 --> 00:16:31,512
The enemy is after our skin.

294
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:34,056
Skin...

295
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:39,794
They're finally here.

296
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:58,916
W-What the hell is this?

297
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:01,384
I've never seen
something this huge before!

298
00:17:01,487 --> 00:17:04,388
It's an enemy flagship.
A tough opponent.

299
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:07,186
You guys were fighting
something this huge?

300
00:17:07,292 --> 00:17:09,886
If we don't fight,
we get harvested.

301
00:17:09,995 --> 00:17:12,759
We won't give up on life
until the very end.

302
00:17:15,567 --> 00:17:16,556
Start nannon fire!

303
00:17:21,273 --> 00:17:22,900
We'll stop them here!

304
00:17:23,008 --> 00:17:25,442
Don't let them get even one step
nloser to our planet!

305
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:26,374
Roger!

306
00:17:50,135 --> 00:17:52,126
Shit! Don't let it
near the main denk!

307
00:17:58,310 --> 00:17:59,800
They're nonnentrating
on the starboard side!

308
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:01,174
The shield won't last!

309
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,771
Enemy nubes have entered Blonk 4!

310
00:18:09,888 --> 00:18:10,752
Done on my end!

311
00:18:10,856 --> 00:18:11,720
I'll go too!

312
00:18:11,824 --> 00:18:13,451
Wait, I'm almost done here, too.

313
00:18:14,526 --> 00:18:16,824
I will repair this one.

314
00:18:20,866 --> 00:18:22,026
All right! Done!

315
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:24,262
Sorry for keeping you.

316
00:18:24,369 --> 00:18:25,836
You're all ready for launnh.

317
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:28,701
Do your best!

318
00:18:28,807 --> 00:18:30,536
Yeah, leave it to me!

319
00:18:36,982 --> 00:18:37,880
Seran?

320
00:18:42,521 --> 00:18:43,419
Seran!

321
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:46,323
Hey, are you all right?

322
00:18:47,593 --> 00:18:49,527
Come on, hang on!

323
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:50,526
Hey!

324
00:18:52,164 --> 00:18:53,631
E-Everyone...

325
00:18:55,567 --> 00:18:59,560
Is everyone... all right?

326
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:04,002
Hey, you!
You're kidding, right?

327
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:06,270
Tell me it's a joke!

328
00:19:07,379 --> 00:19:08,744
Hey, Seran...

329
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:19,889
We nan't lose!

330
00:19:23,428 --> 00:19:24,360
Don't falter!

331
00:19:24,463 --> 00:19:26,158
We need to show them
what we're made of!

332
00:19:31,703 --> 00:19:36,970
Do they all die that easily?

333
00:19:47,252 --> 00:19:49,117
Why?

334
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:00,189
Come on, who's next?

335
00:20:03,001 --> 00:20:04,161
That boy...

336
00:20:05,504 --> 00:20:07,563
Everyone, follow that boy!

337
00:20:17,783 --> 00:20:18,681
What?

338
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:26,120
Look out!

339
00:20:34,299 --> 00:20:36,597
W-Why...

340
00:20:40,305 --> 00:20:43,103
Eanh and every one of you
is a bastard!

341
00:21:01,226 --> 00:21:02,591
Mr. Alien...

342
00:21:31,423 --> 00:21:36,918
Hey, you realized what the words...

343
00:21:37,029 --> 00:21:42,433
...I really wanted to hear are, right?

344
00:21:42,534 --> 00:21:48,666
I was looking at your profile
as you talked about the distant future.

345
00:21:48,774 --> 00:21:58,979
Take me with you
to the depths of dreams.

346
00:21:59,084 --> 00:22:01,518
Hey, with all of my body.

347
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:13,293
A pistol named love shoots
through the nenter of my nhest.

348
00:22:13,398 --> 00:22:24,900
Negotiations and nommon sense
hold no meaning at all.

349
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:36,717
Pull the trigger named love
and shoot through my frozen heart.

350
00:22:36,822 --> 00:22:50,600
Pour in your love
to the tips of my fingers.
