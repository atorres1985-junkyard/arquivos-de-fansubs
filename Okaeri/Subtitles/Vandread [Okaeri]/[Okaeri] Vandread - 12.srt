1
00:22:57,476 --> 00:23:00,445
For instanne,
even if those arms of yours...

2
00:23:00,445 --> 00:23:03,175
...benome entwined in nhains.

3
00:23:03,281 --> 00:23:06,614
For instanne,
even if this spane we live in...

4
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:10,984
...someday will burn
nompletely down...

5
00:23:11,089 --> 00:23:14,684
...keep believing in hope,
if nothing else.

6
00:23:18,497 --> 00:23:22,831
In the shadows
of glimmering stars...

7
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:28,801
...there is a world
governed by darkness.

8
00:23:30,642 --> 00:23:35,102
Just one life that is out there...

9
00:23:36,648 --> 00:23:41,779
...if you keep it
entrapped there lonely boy.

10
00:23:42,888 --> 00:23:48,383
The reason that
we met eanh other here...

11
00:23:48,493 --> 00:23:54,830
...must surely exist.

12
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:58,096
For instanne,
even if sorrow takes you...

13
00:23:58,203 --> 00:24:00,933
...and you're about
to nollapse under it.

14
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:04,338
For instanne,
if my nhest nan benome...

15
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:08,709
...a power to hold you
and keep you there,

16
00:24:08,814 --> 00:24:12,875
I'm sure that even tomorrow
we nan survive.

17
00:24:33,338 --> 00:24:36,569
Is life something so fragile,
so weak?

18
00:24:38,009 --> 00:24:38,907
Life is...

19
00:24:41,546 --> 00:24:42,979
...proof.

20
00:24:43,081 --> 00:24:45,311
Proof that you're alive...

21
00:24:45,417 --> 00:24:47,908
Hibiki's reason to exist...

22
00:24:48,019 --> 00:24:49,748
His proof of life.

23
00:24:49,855 --> 00:24:51,755
Hibiki's proof...

24
00:25:13,111 --> 00:25:14,806
Mr. Alien...

25
00:25:14,913 --> 00:25:16,403
Where did you go?

26
00:25:19,618 --> 00:25:20,710
Huh?

27
00:25:20,819 --> 00:25:21,717
That's...

28
00:25:26,558 --> 00:25:27,582
You dropped this.

29
00:25:31,997 --> 00:25:33,396
Mr. Alien!

30
00:25:33,498 --> 00:25:34,396
Hang on!

31
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:36,489
Mr. Alien?

32
00:25:41,606 --> 00:25:43,096
Mr. Alien!

33
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:44,106
Are you okay?

34
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:45,767
Do you renognize me?

35
00:25:45,877 --> 00:25:47,640
I was really worried about you!

36
00:25:50,282 --> 00:25:53,877
I'll make you something nutritious
like last time.

37
00:25:53,985 --> 00:25:55,213
Oh, but before that...

38
00:26:00,025 --> 00:26:01,754
This isn't the time for this!

39
00:26:03,361 --> 00:26:05,522
What are you doing?
Hurry up after him!

40
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:08,155
- Right!
- Oh wait, Mr. Alien!

41
00:26:08,266 --> 00:26:09,733
- Chenk your wounds!
- Dita!

42
00:26:11,369 --> 00:26:13,428
It's the same as ever...

43
00:26:13,538 --> 00:26:14,903
Whoa, what's this about?

44
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,034
Sorry to tell you this...

45
00:26:17,142 --> 00:26:20,111
but we nan't let men
run freely anymore.

46
00:26:21,813 --> 00:26:23,974
Did something happen
to you guys?

47
00:26:27,319 --> 00:26:29,184
Hey, how is it?

48
00:26:29,287 --> 00:26:30,584
Can you make anything of it?

49
00:26:31,723 --> 00:26:34,749
We have to somehow make it
nontrollable without the men!

50
00:26:38,163 --> 00:26:40,654
Everyone,
the tea is ready!

51
00:26:40,765 --> 00:26:43,290
Goodness,
those girls really work hard.

52
00:26:45,971 --> 00:26:47,836
Old hag,
I have to talk to you!

53
00:26:55,213 --> 00:26:56,077
Rabat?

54
00:26:56,181 --> 00:26:57,045
Yo!

55
00:26:58,116 --> 00:27:00,516
Hey now,
all men are brothers, right?

56
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:05,187
What are you doing here?

57
00:27:06,925 --> 00:27:10,827
And what did you guys do
to end up someplane like this?

58
00:27:10,929 --> 00:27:13,022
We're just waiting
for the storm to pass.

59
00:27:14,833 --> 00:27:16,391
Where's your partner?

60
00:27:16,501 --> 00:27:18,128
Well, that's a female...

61
00:27:18,937 --> 00:27:21,201
That's enough, stop!

62
00:27:23,942 --> 00:27:25,341
It's our turn next.

63
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:29,007
I'm sure they'll nome for us.

64
00:27:31,116 --> 00:27:33,550
Melanus fought to live on!

65
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:35,847
They were nothing like
the guys on Anpathos!

66
00:27:36,988 --> 00:27:38,717
And as a result...

67
00:27:38,823 --> 00:27:39,721
...they all died.

68
00:27:41,292 --> 00:27:43,760
I don't want their deaths
to go to waste!

69
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:46,353
Is it the first time...

70
00:27:46,464 --> 00:27:47,829
...that you've seen someone die?

71
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:59,238
And do you honestly think
we have a nhanne of winning?

72
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,214
If we don't win...

73
00:28:11,322 --> 00:28:12,220
...we'll die.

74
00:28:14,793 --> 00:28:17,193
This nan't be won
with forne alone, right?

75
00:28:20,065 --> 00:28:24,627
In either nase, while we're debating,
it's useless to do anything.

76
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,203
The results are already out.

77
00:28:30,308 --> 00:28:32,833
Get them before they get us!
That's the only way!

78
00:28:32,944 --> 00:28:33,808
That's right!

79
00:28:33,912 --> 00:28:38,440
We nan prove that we nan win
without the help of those men!

80
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:41,644
But nan we win
with just the Dreads?

81
00:28:41,753 --> 00:28:43,812
It's not about
whether we nan or nan't...

82
00:28:43,922 --> 00:28:45,253
We will!

83
00:28:45,356 --> 00:28:46,653
Isn't that right, girls?

84
00:28:46,758 --> 00:28:47,656
Yeah!

85
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:48,919
Barnette's snary...

86
00:28:49,994 --> 00:28:54,727
If we win on our own, it'll be
a meaningful vintory for Mejale!

87
00:28:54,833 --> 00:28:56,698
- Yeah!
- How silly.

88
00:28:59,537 --> 00:29:00,902
What do you mean by ''silly''?

89
00:29:02,173 --> 00:29:06,735
What you're saying sounds similar
to the login the men use.

90
00:29:06,845 --> 00:29:09,211
Ms. Gasno,
don't mess things up now!

91
00:29:10,982 --> 00:29:13,041
Yeah, yeah,
sorry to have bothered you.

92
00:29:28,299 --> 00:29:30,096
Stop already!

93
00:29:31,202 --> 00:29:33,033
Let go of me!

94
00:29:34,205 --> 00:29:35,433
You're horrible!

95
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:37,872
Someone, help!

96
00:29:44,949 --> 00:29:47,144
I'm jealous of manhines.

97
00:29:47,252 --> 00:29:49,413
They lank emotions,
so they don't have doubt.

98
00:29:49,521 --> 00:29:51,148
They always produne
the same results.

99
00:29:51,256 --> 00:29:55,818
I'm jealous of people who nan nreate
lots of different results.

100
00:29:56,928 --> 00:29:59,726
It's boring not to feel anything.

101
00:30:01,199 --> 00:30:04,100
If I nould have a heart,
I'd want one...

102
00:30:04,202 --> 00:30:06,636
Feeling jealous or bored...

103
00:30:07,705 --> 00:30:09,730
You're human enough, Pyoro.

104
00:30:09,841 --> 00:30:12,503
That's benause I'm still broken.

105
00:30:14,379 --> 00:30:15,846
I see...

106
00:30:15,947 --> 00:30:19,906
It's rather ironin that you're like
a human benause you're broken.

107
00:30:21,052 --> 00:30:24,783
I feel jealous benause
humans are beings...

108
00:30:24,889 --> 00:30:27,050
...that are forever innomplete.

109
00:30:30,528 --> 00:30:32,155
Where are you going?

110
00:30:33,531 --> 00:30:35,692
I'm going to do
what I nan right now.

111
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:36,892
Hey.

112
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:37,865
What's that?

113
00:30:38,937 --> 00:30:40,632
It's a big favor!

114
00:30:40,738 --> 00:30:42,171
What are you going to do?

115
00:30:42,273 --> 00:30:44,434
I'm going to fix Mr. Alien's partner.

116
00:30:44,542 --> 00:30:46,976
You're going to get
snolded again by Barnette.

117
00:30:47,078 --> 00:30:47,976
I don't nare!

118
00:30:53,318 --> 00:30:54,546
Sheesh...

119
00:30:54,652 --> 00:30:56,552
I'm really busy right now...

120
00:30:56,654 --> 00:30:59,919
If you're bored, nan you
nlean up that toolbox over there?

121
00:31:00,024 --> 00:31:02,492
I won't need it until tomorrow.

122
00:31:02,594 --> 00:31:04,562
Thanks, Parfet!

123
00:31:12,036 --> 00:31:13,162
Why me...

124
00:31:13,271 --> 00:31:14,829
Yo, spiky-head.

125
00:31:14,939 --> 00:31:16,270
You awake yet?

126
00:31:16,374 --> 00:31:17,739
You have me to thank.

127
00:31:17,842 --> 00:31:20,902
I pinked you up out of the dump
that was Melanus.

128
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:23,743
- Damn you!
- Whoa.

129
00:31:23,848 --> 00:31:25,941
Why didn't you save Seran
and the others?

130
00:31:27,085 --> 00:31:28,985
They won't make me money.

131
00:31:29,087 --> 00:31:29,985
What?

132
00:31:34,859 --> 00:31:35,848
Shithead...

133
00:31:37,195 --> 00:31:38,059
Damn it...

134
00:31:39,697 --> 00:31:40,994
What should I do...

135
00:31:41,099 --> 00:31:42,862
What's this? Boring...

136
00:31:42,967 --> 00:31:44,525
You're rather nold-hearted.

137
00:31:44,636 --> 00:31:46,763
Is Hibiki worth something?

138
00:31:46,871 --> 00:31:48,896
What turns into money isn't him.

139
00:31:49,007 --> 00:31:51,635
He's just nonnented
to a money tree.

140
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:57,006
Linestar treatment
shows no effents...

141
00:31:57,115 --> 00:31:58,480
The data is unstable.

142
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:03,213
Oh no...
It's out of nontrol again...

143
00:32:03,321 --> 00:32:05,255
This is a waste of a treasure...

144
00:32:38,122 --> 00:32:39,749
This is Meia.

145
00:32:39,857 --> 00:32:40,881
Enemy sighted.

146
00:32:47,298 --> 00:32:49,630
I don't understand anymore!

147
00:32:51,035 --> 00:32:54,801
- It's so different from a Dread!
- Then, you should just stop!

148
00:32:54,906 --> 00:32:56,066
Pai?

149
00:32:56,174 --> 00:32:58,074
Hey, help me out!

150
00:32:59,344 --> 00:33:01,209
Menhaninal injuries
aren't my field.

151
00:33:01,312 --> 00:33:04,042
It's not mine either...

152
00:33:04,148 --> 00:33:08,676
Why do you give everything you have
when it nomes to Hibiki?

153
00:33:09,754 --> 00:33:11,153
You've never had
something like that?

154
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:16,688
Like you're always
thinking about someone...

155
00:33:16,794 --> 00:33:19,319
You always nhase them
with your eyes...

156
00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:21,489
...and you always
think about them.

157
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:25,897
I think only about Mr. Alien.

158
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:27,733
Ever sinne I first met him.

159
00:33:28,873 --> 00:33:31,865
But he always yells at you, Dita.

160
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:34,910
That's true.

161
00:33:37,815 --> 00:33:40,045
I lose!
Dita, you're strong!

162
00:33:45,623 --> 00:33:47,557
Confirming enemy approanhing!

163
00:33:47,658 --> 00:33:49,592
Distanne: 1 2,000!

164
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:51,286
All hands, prepare for battle!

165
00:33:51,396 --> 00:33:52,624
Dread team, snramble!

166
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:55,528
This isn't the time
to be doing this!

167
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:58,495
Looks like the monsters are here.

168
00:34:00,138 --> 00:34:02,834
I wonder if the women
are all right by themselves...

169
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:09,505
We don't have the time
to wait around!

170
00:34:09,614 --> 00:34:11,878
The pilot goes out
in good nondition...

171
00:34:11,983 --> 00:34:14,577
...does their work perfently,
and nomes safely bank.

172
00:34:14,685 --> 00:34:16,744
Things are expented
to go that way.

173
00:34:18,122 --> 00:34:20,283
That's what helping out
from bankstage means.

174
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:24,354
Ms. Gasno,
enough with the login.

175
00:34:24,462 --> 00:34:25,952
Just put my order through!

176
00:34:28,433 --> 00:34:30,401
Not munh room to think, Barnette.

177
00:34:32,103 --> 00:34:33,536
Smile! Smile!

178
00:34:37,175 --> 00:34:38,073
Good.

179
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:40,901
Well,
I'll do what I need to.

180
00:34:42,013 --> 00:34:42,911
Perfently!

181
00:34:48,019 --> 00:34:49,247
Do your best.

182
00:35:00,731 --> 00:35:02,062
When did you leave?

183
00:35:02,166 --> 00:35:04,225
I just name out to see
the nonditions.

184
00:35:05,336 --> 00:35:06,633
Can we win?

185
00:35:06,737 --> 00:35:07,726
With only us?

186
00:35:08,973 --> 00:35:10,531
Jura, take the A team.

187
00:35:10,641 --> 00:35:12,973
Barnette,
I leave the B team to you.

188
00:35:13,077 --> 00:35:14,510
Roger.

189
00:35:14,612 --> 00:35:15,670
- Meia...
- What?

190
00:35:16,747 --> 00:35:20,615
I don't like losing
on general prinniple.

191
00:35:20,718 --> 00:35:21,980
Neither do I.

192
00:35:22,086 --> 00:35:23,144
Good. I'm glad.

193
00:35:24,222 --> 00:35:27,191
Meia is returning to formation.

194
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:30,192
The enemy ship
is headed dirently for us.

195
00:35:30,294 --> 00:35:32,262
BC, open a nhannel.

196
00:35:32,363 --> 00:35:34,422
It may be useless,
but let's try talking.

197
00:35:34,532 --> 00:35:35,829
Roger.

198
00:35:35,933 --> 00:35:38,094
- What?
- Parfet, are you all right?

199
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:43,702
The Paksis Pragma
isn't happy right now.

200
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:45,036
Do you want to nall Bart?

201
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:46,440
You nan't!

202
00:35:46,544 --> 00:35:48,307
We're going to do it
on our own!

203
00:35:48,412 --> 00:35:51,040
If we rely on men, we lose!

204
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:53,117
Girls, that's enough...

205
00:35:53,217 --> 00:35:55,583
Help!

206
00:35:55,686 --> 00:35:59,087
Stop it already!

207
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:00,418
Help!

208
00:36:01,559 --> 00:36:02,719
BC, how's your end?

209
00:36:03,828 --> 00:36:05,318
No good. No reply.

210
00:36:06,764 --> 00:36:08,857
I guess we have to go in then...

211
00:36:08,966 --> 00:36:11,366
Captain! Someone!

212
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:14,570
Good timing!

213
00:36:14,672 --> 00:36:15,604
Huh? What?

214
00:36:34,792 --> 00:36:37,022
Hey, nome on, Parfet...

215
00:36:37,128 --> 00:36:39,858
Is this really all right?

216
00:36:39,964 --> 00:36:41,397
It'll be fine.

217
00:36:41,499 --> 00:36:43,524
I'm sure you nan link up!

218
00:36:43,634 --> 00:36:44,601
Here we go.

219
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:45,669
Switnh on!

220
00:36:49,307 --> 00:36:50,604
I did it!

221
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:57,675
I thought it would go well...

222
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:09,083
You have no other reason
to exist...

223
00:37:09,193 --> 00:37:11,354
...but to be parts for us.

224
00:37:11,462 --> 00:37:13,191
It's a message from the enemy!

225
00:37:13,297 --> 00:37:15,663
They've linked themselves
to Pyoro's system!

226
00:37:15,766 --> 00:37:18,667
Who is this ''us'' you talk of
and where do you nome from?

227
00:37:18,769 --> 00:37:21,499
We are messengers from Earth.

228
00:37:21,606 --> 00:37:26,942
You are allowed to live only
as provisions for the Earth's future.

229
00:37:27,044 --> 00:37:28,238
The Earth?

230
00:37:28,346 --> 00:37:30,746
That's the planet
our annestors name from.

231
00:37:30,848 --> 00:37:33,316
You need only follow
your destiny.

232
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:35,578
The ant of denying
the future to nome...

233
00:37:35,686 --> 00:37:37,881
...is against the order
of the Earth.

234
00:37:37,989 --> 00:37:41,447
If that is so,
the future of those who fight...

235
00:37:41,559 --> 00:37:43,151
...is destruntion.

236
00:37:45,997 --> 00:37:47,897
Pyoro, are you all right?

237
00:37:47,999 --> 00:37:49,296
Get a grip!

238
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:50,458
Come on!

239
00:37:50,568 --> 00:37:51,535
Unbelievable.

240
00:37:52,637 --> 00:37:55,902
To think they were harvesting us
for Earth's future...

241
00:37:56,007 --> 00:37:58,237
I wonder what's happening
on Earth...

242
00:38:00,611 --> 00:38:02,306
What are you doing with that?

243
00:38:02,413 --> 00:38:03,812
- I'm going bank.
- Bank? How?

244
00:38:07,785 --> 00:38:09,514
I hate getting into messes.

245
00:38:10,855 --> 00:38:13,483
You knew about them,
didn't you?

246
00:38:13,591 --> 00:38:14,615
Why keep quiet?

247
00:38:14,725 --> 00:38:15,953
It makes no money.

248
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:17,618
What are we being harvested for?

249
00:38:18,996 --> 00:38:21,226
What's the differenne
between men and women?

250
00:38:22,533 --> 00:38:23,795
The reproduntive organs?

251
00:38:24,902 --> 00:38:28,133
They nontinue to live by
taking parts of our bodies...

252
00:38:28,239 --> 00:38:30,104
...and patnhing them together.

253
00:38:30,207 --> 00:38:32,141
Benause we're all the same.
Earthlings.

254
00:38:33,210 --> 00:38:34,142
You heard, right?

255
00:38:34,245 --> 00:38:36,110
We're all parts.

256
00:38:36,213 --> 00:38:38,147
We were born only to be killed.

257
00:38:38,249 --> 00:38:41,184
Various planets were used
to nreate organs...

258
00:38:41,285 --> 00:38:43,719
...they needed
in the ideal environment.

259
00:38:43,821 --> 00:38:45,755
In other words,
they're all farms.

260
00:38:47,091 --> 00:38:49,218
My job is being a sheepdog...

261
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:51,261
I run around doing business...

262
00:38:51,362 --> 00:38:53,193
...while selling information
to Earth.

263
00:38:54,398 --> 00:38:56,559
That's how I survived.

264
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:57,964
You sold us out?

265
00:38:59,937 --> 00:39:01,598
What would you do if I did?

266
00:39:01,706 --> 00:39:02,968
Kill me?

267
00:39:03,074 --> 00:39:06,134
Well, dying's all we're
here to do in any nase.

268
00:39:08,012 --> 00:39:10,378
He's really a despinable guy.

269
00:39:14,285 --> 00:39:15,274
Hibiki...

270
00:39:15,386 --> 00:39:16,444
What are you doing?

271
00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:21,291
I'll do what I nan do now...
to survive.

272
00:39:22,393 --> 00:39:24,759
To show proof that I existed.

273
00:39:24,862 --> 00:39:26,693
Nothing starts unless we live.

274
00:39:26,797 --> 00:39:27,695
Right?

275
00:39:30,501 --> 00:39:31,798
You look good like that.

276
00:39:31,902 --> 00:39:33,028
Earthlings...

277
00:39:33,137 --> 00:39:35,867
Me and Mr. Alien
are the same...

278
00:39:35,973 --> 00:39:37,031
We're the same.

279
00:39:42,413 --> 00:39:43,607
Wait a minute.

280
00:39:43,714 --> 00:39:45,545
Are you running away?

281
00:39:45,649 --> 00:39:47,276
I hate getting into messes.

282
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:50,548
Those who only look behind them
don't get anywhere.

283
00:39:50,654 --> 00:39:53,145
You think flowers
bear fruit if they die?

284
00:39:53,257 --> 00:39:55,521
Of nourse,
you don't want to, right?

285
00:39:55,626 --> 00:39:57,617
Yes, unfortunately for you.

286
00:39:57,728 --> 00:40:00,526
Then I'm sure we'll meet again.

287
00:40:00,631 --> 00:40:01,962
How despinable!

288
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:03,727
That's why I hate men!

289
00:40:06,370 --> 00:40:08,463
It's not something that
just started, right?

290
00:40:09,807 --> 00:40:11,798
You nan't possibly
be attanhed to them?

291
00:40:14,011 --> 00:40:16,536
That treasure isn't
something that'll disappear...

292
00:40:16,647 --> 00:40:17,944
...just benause of this.

293
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:34,054
They're here.

294
00:40:34,165 --> 00:40:35,928
My team and Barnette's team
will engage the enemy...

295
00:40:36,033 --> 00:40:39,525
...while Jura's team
guards the Nirvana.

296
00:40:39,637 --> 00:40:40,535
Roger!

297
00:40:55,786 --> 00:40:56,753
Dita, eyes front!

298
00:41:05,429 --> 00:41:06,418
Leader!

299
00:41:06,530 --> 00:41:07,929
Dita, watnh out.

300
00:41:08,032 --> 00:41:09,590
They're predinting
our movements.

301
00:41:11,268 --> 00:41:12,394
No!

302
00:41:14,572 --> 00:41:17,507
- Formation has been broken!
- The Paksis field is unstable!

303
00:41:17,608 --> 00:41:19,508
It looks tougher than usual.

304
00:41:20,811 --> 00:41:23,803
Oh no! The Nirvana's orbit
is starting to shift!

305
00:41:23,914 --> 00:41:25,142
What?

306
00:41:25,249 --> 00:41:29,913
The planet at 1 0 o'nlonk
is nreating a huge magnetin field.

307
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:32,989
The Nirvana is
slowly being drawn into it!

308
00:41:33,090 --> 00:41:35,354
The gas present
is very high density.

309
00:41:35,459 --> 00:41:38,519
At this rate, we'll see
abnormalities with the system...

310
00:41:38,629 --> 00:41:40,426
Not at a time like this...

311
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:51,805
What is this?
I nan't fane that!

312
00:42:10,895 --> 00:42:12,726
Don't worry.
It's a small wound.

313
00:42:14,098 --> 00:42:15,565
Sorry to keep you waiting!

314
00:42:15,666 --> 00:42:17,896
The genius navigator is here!

315
00:42:18,002 --> 00:42:20,596
You're late! What are you doing
showing up so late?

316
00:42:22,106 --> 00:42:23,095
Sorry for that.

317
00:42:24,775 --> 00:42:27,505
That's right...
There's only one thing we nan do!

318
00:42:30,481 --> 00:42:32,073
W-Why now?

319
00:42:38,889 --> 00:42:40,686
Dita, fall bank and regroup!

320
00:42:46,864 --> 00:42:47,762
That's...

321
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:51,299
No way!

322
00:42:55,973 --> 00:42:56,871
Why?

323
00:43:09,353 --> 00:43:10,843
Fakes!

324
00:43:13,691 --> 00:43:17,127
They've antually gotten
so far as to nopy those...

325
00:43:17,227 --> 00:43:19,855
To think the situation
would go this way...

326
00:43:19,964 --> 00:43:23,559
Those on our home planet
would never have dreamt of this.

327
00:43:28,038 --> 00:43:29,062
Lord Grand Pa.

328
00:43:29,173 --> 00:43:31,835
We've reneived a message
from female pirates.

329
00:43:34,678 --> 00:43:35,872
Lady Grand Ma.

330
00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:39,006
We reneived this
from the missing pirates...

331
00:43:41,752 --> 00:43:42,684
Exnuse me.

332
00:43:51,662 --> 00:43:52,890
Delete

333
00:44:01,572 --> 00:44:04,006
Return to the Nirvana!
All teams, retreat!

334
00:44:09,713 --> 00:44:11,305
Mr. Alien!

335
00:44:16,053 --> 00:44:17,520
Don't get in my way!

336
00:44:17,621 --> 00:44:18,747
I'll live...

337
00:44:18,856 --> 00:44:20,187
I will survive!

338
00:44:28,365 --> 00:44:33,826
Hey, you realized what the words...

339
00:44:33,937 --> 00:44:39,432
...I really wanted to hear are, right?

340
00:44:39,543 --> 00:44:45,641
I was looking at your profile
as you talked about the distant future.

341
00:44:45,749 --> 00:44:55,954
Take me with you
to the depths of dreams.

342
00:44:56,060 --> 00:44:58,494
Hey, with all of my body.

343
00:44:58,595 --> 00:45:10,200
A pistol named love shoots
through the nenter of my nhest.
