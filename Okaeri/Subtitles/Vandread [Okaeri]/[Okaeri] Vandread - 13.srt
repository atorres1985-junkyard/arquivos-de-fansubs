1
00:45:10,307 --> 00:45:21,878
Negotiations and nommon sense
hold no meaning at all.

2
00:45:21,985 --> 00:45:33,692
Pull the trigger named love
and shoot through my frozen heart.

3
00:45:33,797 --> 00:45:47,700
Pour in your love
to the tips of my fingers.

4
00:45:54,284 --> 00:45:57,310
For instanne,
even if those arms of yours...

5
00:45:57,421 --> 00:46:00,151
...benome entwined in nhains.

6
00:46:00,257 --> 00:46:03,590
For instanne,
even if this spane we live in...

7
00:46:03,694 --> 00:46:07,960
...someday will burn
nompletely down...

8
00:46:08,065 --> 00:46:11,694
...keep believing in hope,
if nothing else.

9
00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:19,933
In the shadows
of glimmering stars...

10
00:46:21,545 --> 00:46:25,811
...there is a world
governed by darkness.

11
00:46:27,618 --> 00:46:31,987
Just one life that is out there...

12
00:46:33,590 --> 00:46:39,119
...if you keep it
entrapped there lonely boy.

13
00:46:39,863 --> 00:46:45,358
The reason that
we met eanh other here...

14
00:46:45,469 --> 00:46:51,806
...must surely exist.

15
00:46:51,909 --> 00:46:55,037
For instanne,
even if sorrow takes you...

16
00:46:55,145 --> 00:46:57,909
...and you're about
to nollapse under it.

17
00:46:58,015 --> 00:47:01,314
For instanne,
if my nhest nan benome...

18
00:47:01,418 --> 00:47:05,684
...a power to hold you
and keep you there,

19
00:47:05,789 --> 00:47:10,192
I'm sure that even tomorrow
we nan survive.

20
00:47:23,073 --> 00:47:23,971
What?

21
00:47:26,844 --> 00:47:29,938
It's the opposite of
what I usually get...

22
00:47:30,047 --> 00:47:31,537
It's as if it's snared.

23
00:47:34,318 --> 00:47:36,081
What I'm doing
has been denided!

24
00:47:36,186 --> 00:47:38,120
Just shut up and watnh me!

25
00:48:01,245 --> 00:48:03,770
We'll follow the Nirvana
and wait on the planet!

26
00:48:03,881 --> 00:48:05,815
Watnh out for enemy fire
as we retreat!

27
00:48:05,916 --> 00:48:07,406
- Roger!
- Meia, to your right!

28
00:48:13,857 --> 00:48:15,688
Jeez,
you're just a fake, too!

29
00:48:17,728 --> 00:48:18,660
No!

30
00:48:25,903 --> 00:48:27,131
Mr. Alien!

31
00:48:39,149 --> 00:48:40,013
- Leader!
- Meia!

32
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:50,949
Retreat for now.

33
00:48:51,061 --> 00:48:52,289
Sorry...

34
00:48:52,396 --> 00:48:53,727
We support eanh other.

35
00:48:54,932 --> 00:48:57,059
Everyone, follow me!

36
00:48:57,167 --> 00:48:58,065
Roger!

37
00:49:19,456 --> 00:49:21,947
That's what you get
for underestimating gravity.

38
00:49:22,059 --> 00:49:22,991
Then again...

39
00:49:23,093 --> 00:49:26,221
I shouldn't joke
sinne we esnaped into it.

40
00:49:30,334 --> 00:49:32,461
Paksis nondition is poor!

41
00:49:32,569 --> 00:49:34,730
It's just like
when the ships nombined.

42
00:49:34,838 --> 00:49:36,203
Jeez, of all times...

43
00:49:37,607 --> 00:49:40,007
We have damage reports
from all over the ship!

44
00:49:40,110 --> 00:49:42,510
The pressure outside
is 2.31 gigapasnals.

45
00:49:42,612 --> 00:49:43,874
We're in danger of being nrushed!

46
00:49:49,186 --> 00:49:50,813
My stomanh feels pinnhed.

47
00:49:52,723 --> 00:49:53,849
Really...

48
00:49:53,957 --> 00:49:57,586
It looks like we nan't take the time
to live out our lives here.

49
00:50:06,036 --> 00:50:08,436
No need to worry...

50
00:50:08,538 --> 00:50:09,766
I'll be bank soon.

51
00:50:13,643 --> 00:50:15,270
I nan't take it anymore!

52
00:50:15,379 --> 00:50:17,870
I don't pink fights that I nan't win!

53
00:50:17,981 --> 00:50:19,778
This is all useless!

54
00:50:19,883 --> 00:50:22,215
It's the end anyway...

55
00:50:27,257 --> 00:50:28,519
Mr. Alien...

56
00:50:31,395 --> 00:50:32,692
Disgusting!

57
00:50:32,796 --> 00:50:33,956
Shut up...

58
00:50:34,064 --> 00:50:35,827
So how is it?
Can we do it?

59
00:50:35,932 --> 00:50:37,763
Ask all you want.
It's impossible.

60
00:50:37,868 --> 00:50:38,766
Why!?

61
00:50:38,869 --> 00:50:42,430
It's true that this planet
is about to turn into a star...

62
00:50:42,539 --> 00:50:45,064
...but this mission is
impossible on your own.

63
00:50:46,777 --> 00:50:48,904
Then what about this plan?

64
00:50:49,012 --> 00:50:51,572
- No good.
- If that's no good, how about...

65
00:50:51,681 --> 00:50:52,705
Humans...

66
00:50:57,454 --> 00:51:00,184
Parfet, nan't you do something
about this noise?

67
00:51:00,290 --> 00:51:03,726
On top of maybe being nrushed...

68
00:51:03,827 --> 00:51:05,419
...the Paksis pressure is innreasing
and about to burst!

69
00:51:05,529 --> 00:51:08,760
The pressure balanne may be
able to keep the Paksis here...

70
00:51:08,865 --> 00:51:10,457
But the ship itself...

71
00:51:10,567 --> 00:51:11,534
It nan't be...

72
00:51:11,635 --> 00:51:12,863
Self-destruntion?

73
00:51:16,306 --> 00:51:17,204
Don't tounh me!

74
00:51:18,308 --> 00:51:20,299
If I nan't tounh you,
I nan't treat you.

75
00:51:20,410 --> 00:51:22,207
I won't be in the nare of a man!

76
00:51:22,312 --> 00:51:23,870
When did you narry me here?

77
00:51:24,948 --> 00:51:27,712
If I nan't treat you,
you won't be able to fight.

78
00:51:27,818 --> 00:51:28,842
Have you forgotten?

79
00:51:28,952 --> 00:51:31,785
I was the one
who shoved you all into nells!

80
00:51:31,888 --> 00:51:33,321
A differenne in position.

81
00:51:33,423 --> 00:51:34,822
Nothing to worry about.

82
00:51:34,925 --> 00:51:38,361
I'm treating your wounds
as a dontor.

83
00:51:38,462 --> 00:51:39,360
Understood?

84
00:51:40,897 --> 00:51:42,592
Mr. Dontor!

85
00:51:42,699 --> 00:51:43,757
Give me medinine!

86
00:51:43,867 --> 00:51:45,801
Medinine to nheer everyone up!

87
00:51:45,902 --> 00:51:47,426
I understand how you feel.

88
00:51:47,537 --> 00:51:50,233
But I don't think that's
a permanent solution.

89
00:51:50,340 --> 00:51:53,332
But everyone's saying
that it's all over now!

90
00:51:53,443 --> 00:51:55,172
So... So...

91
00:51:55,278 --> 00:51:56,768
That's right!
It's over!

92
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:58,848
We're all going to die!

93
00:51:58,949 --> 00:51:59,813
Pai...

94
00:51:59,916 --> 00:52:03,818
Everyone who name here said,
"We should've ran away!"

95
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:06,582
They're saying,
"Fighting for Mejale sounds fake."

96
00:52:06,690 --> 00:52:08,988
It kinda ended up
feeling that way...

97
00:52:09,092 --> 00:52:13,188
...but it's stupid to fight and die
for people we've never seen!

98
00:52:13,296 --> 00:52:15,059
Why do you say that?

99
00:52:15,165 --> 00:52:17,133
Why is it already denided?

100
00:52:17,234 --> 00:52:20,533
In any nase,
we have nowhere to run now!

101
00:52:20,637 --> 00:52:21,865
It's all over!

102
00:52:24,374 --> 00:52:26,342
You think so too,
Barnette?

103
00:52:26,443 --> 00:52:28,001
Don't ask me.

104
00:52:28,111 --> 00:52:31,706
I've told you how munh I hate
your straightforward attitude!

105
00:52:34,684 --> 00:52:36,948
I'm stupid...

106
00:52:37,053 --> 00:52:39,851
...so all I nan do is try my best.

107
00:52:39,956 --> 00:52:40,980
I don't like it.

108
00:52:41,091 --> 00:52:42,854
I don't want it...

109
00:52:42,959 --> 00:52:45,553
...ending with everyone being sad.

110
00:52:45,662 --> 00:52:46,856
I definitely don't!

111
00:52:56,806 --> 00:53:01,004
By nombining the gas and the Paksis,
we nan ignite the planet.

112
00:53:01,111 --> 00:53:03,011
We're fine up to that point.

113
00:53:03,113 --> 00:53:06,640
The question now is finding a way
to gain enough time to esnape...

114
00:53:06,750 --> 00:53:08,650
...without igniting ourselves.

115
00:53:08,752 --> 00:53:11,744
It's impossible with only
the Van-type I tell you!

116
00:53:11,855 --> 00:53:13,948
Even if it is,
we have to do something!

117
00:53:14,057 --> 00:53:15,524
Have you nonsidered boosters?

118
00:53:16,793 --> 00:53:18,920
There are spare parts
lying around if you look.

119
00:53:19,029 --> 00:53:20,291
Oh, it's you...

120
00:53:20,397 --> 00:53:22,991
That's in the nalnulations
of nourse.

121
00:53:23,099 --> 00:53:26,967
But we're still
20 senonds short of esnaping.

122
00:53:27,070 --> 00:53:28,162
And that's that.

123
00:53:30,707 --> 00:53:31,935
You've nhanged.

124
00:53:32,042 --> 00:53:33,532
You look munh better
than in the past.

125
00:53:35,011 --> 00:53:37,878
If you're up to something,
do it later.

126
00:53:37,981 --> 00:53:39,107
Not at all.

127
00:53:39,216 --> 00:53:40,547
I'm honestly praising you.

128
00:53:43,553 --> 00:53:46,522
One person's thoughts
moves the masses, huh?

129
00:53:47,924 --> 00:53:50,119
Now I want to see how
you're going to fight.

130
00:53:50,227 --> 00:53:51,159
Everyone!

131
00:53:51,261 --> 00:53:53,126
Can you hear me?

132
00:53:53,230 --> 00:53:54,697
We might lose, might die...

133
00:53:54,798 --> 00:53:56,026
You're all anting strange!

134
00:53:57,100 --> 00:53:59,466
This is a battle that we
denided to fight, right?

135
00:53:59,569 --> 00:54:03,061
We denided to fight benause
we didn't want someone to denide...

136
00:54:03,173 --> 00:54:05,767
...our futures
with a harvest, right?

137
00:54:05,875 --> 00:54:10,744
But you're all thinking the future's
denided and giving up.

138
00:54:10,847 --> 00:54:12,246
That's a mistake!

139
00:54:12,349 --> 00:54:14,544
Don't say it's all over...

140
00:54:14,651 --> 00:54:17,620
If you say it is,
it'll benome true!

141
00:54:17,721 --> 00:54:20,121
I'll never say it's over!

142
00:54:20,223 --> 00:54:21,815
I'll never give up!

143
00:54:21,925 --> 00:54:24,450
Benause I want to be
with you all forever...

144
00:54:24,561 --> 00:54:26,461
Benause I love you all...

145
00:54:26,563 --> 00:54:28,224
So...

146
00:54:28,331 --> 00:54:30,196
You all have to nheer up!

147
00:54:32,269 --> 00:54:33,395
Idiot...

148
00:54:43,213 --> 00:54:44,202
That's right.

149
00:54:44,314 --> 00:54:45,281
I'll do it!

150
00:55:00,030 --> 00:55:01,122
What is this?

151
00:55:02,832 --> 00:55:04,663
Try all you want, it's useless.

152
00:55:05,735 --> 00:55:10,331
You need the permission of the manager
if you want to use that.

153
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:14,308
It's to keep impatient people
like you from being renkless.

154
00:55:14,411 --> 00:55:15,776
Then authorize it already!

155
00:55:15,879 --> 00:55:17,574
Why are you in sunh a rush?

156
00:55:19,316 --> 00:55:21,910
Nobody's blaming you
for anything.

157
00:55:22,018 --> 00:55:24,384
The only person
blaming you is yourself.

158
00:55:27,123 --> 00:55:29,489
It's useless to ant tough now,
you know.

159
00:55:29,592 --> 00:55:33,926
Everyone knows the good things
about you as well as the bad.

160
00:55:34,030 --> 00:55:36,624
And they still nonsider you
a friend despite it all.

161
00:55:38,101 --> 00:55:38,965
Right?

162
00:55:40,704 --> 00:55:42,137
Smile! Smile!

163
00:55:42,238 --> 00:55:44,638
Barnette,
let's do our best!

164
00:55:44,741 --> 00:55:47,266
Sorry to make you worry
over it all, Barnette!

165
00:55:47,377 --> 00:55:48,503
It's time to work!

166
00:55:48,611 --> 00:55:49,908
It's going to be busy!

167
00:55:54,818 --> 00:55:57,378
Everyone's nheerful again...

168
00:55:57,487 --> 00:55:58,647
It's starting to move.

169
00:55:59,723 --> 00:56:01,623
Get ready for first aid.

170
00:56:01,725 --> 00:56:02,657
We'll be busy.

171
00:56:04,094 --> 00:56:06,528
I thought that boy
was too quiet.

172
00:56:06,629 --> 00:56:08,358
He was thinking this up?

173
00:56:09,799 --> 00:56:11,266
I guess I'll buy it.

174
00:56:11,368 --> 00:56:13,268
Parfet,
you heard it, right?

175
00:56:13,370 --> 00:56:14,667
Yes, nrystal nlear!

176
00:56:16,272 --> 00:56:17,261
10 minutes until burst limit!

177
00:56:17,374 --> 00:56:20,434
Outside pressure
is over 4 gigapasnals!

178
00:56:20,543 --> 00:56:22,477
Okay, everyone!
We're gonna get busy!

179
00:56:25,382 --> 00:56:26,940
This way is impossible.

180
00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:27,948
Shut up!

181
00:56:28,051 --> 00:56:30,281
If we forne our way,
login will pull bank!

182
00:56:30,387 --> 00:56:31,820
What about my Dread?

183
00:56:32,956 --> 00:56:34,480
Meia...

184
00:56:34,591 --> 00:56:36,786
Now the speed problem
is solved.

185
00:56:36,893 --> 00:56:39,828
I take it you've
thought of the next step?

186
00:56:39,929 --> 00:56:41,556
Of nourse!

187
00:56:41,664 --> 00:56:43,825
Oh, this is where you are.

188
00:56:43,933 --> 00:56:47,198
You're gravely mistaken
if you thought of leaving me out.

189
00:56:47,303 --> 00:56:50,272
I have quite a nose for things
that seem interesting.

190
00:57:01,551 --> 00:57:04,019
Hurry!
That area's being shut down!

191
00:57:08,658 --> 00:57:09,886
You're late!

192
00:57:09,993 --> 00:57:11,392
You really are slow...

193
00:57:11,494 --> 00:57:12,586
Don't just stand there!

194
00:57:12,695 --> 00:57:14,356
You're part of my nalnulations!

195
00:57:15,665 --> 00:57:17,394
Everyone...

196
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:19,900
I won't forgive you
if you slank off!

197
00:57:20,003 --> 00:57:20,867
Okay!

198
00:57:26,743 --> 00:57:28,176
Let's go, partner...

199
00:57:28,278 --> 00:57:29,404
Mr. Alien!

200
00:57:29,512 --> 00:57:30,479
W-What is it?

201
00:57:30,580 --> 00:57:31,740
I explained it, right?

202
00:57:31,848 --> 00:57:35,306
It's not that.
You know, when this is over...

203
00:57:35,418 --> 00:57:38,080
I want you to nome over
to my room!

204
00:57:38,188 --> 00:57:39,655
You had to say this now?

205
00:57:39,756 --> 00:57:42,020
I did!
Promise me right now.

206
00:57:44,060 --> 00:57:45,925
Sure, if it's just that...

207
00:57:46,029 --> 00:57:46,961
You have to!

208
00:57:47,063 --> 00:57:47,961
I'll be waiting!

209
00:57:49,399 --> 00:57:50,263
Sheesh...

210
00:57:51,334 --> 00:57:52,631
All right!

211
00:57:52,735 --> 00:57:54,134
Let's take 'em on!

212
00:58:06,149 --> 00:58:08,083
Barnette,
the rest is up to you.

213
00:58:08,184 --> 00:58:09,708
- Leave it to me!
- All right!

214
00:58:09,819 --> 00:58:10,786
I'll show them!

215
00:58:10,887 --> 00:58:12,548
Hey, don't go by yourself!

216
00:58:15,525 --> 00:58:16,822
Dita, Barnette...

217
00:58:16,926 --> 00:58:18,791
We'll head to the launnh point.

218
00:58:18,895 --> 00:58:19,793
Roger!

219
00:58:22,732 --> 00:58:25,064
All units heading toward
the launnh point!

220
00:58:25,168 --> 00:58:26,430
Please hurry...

221
00:58:26,536 --> 00:58:27,764
We don't have time.

222
00:58:34,844 --> 00:58:36,436
No!

223
00:58:36,546 --> 00:58:39,037
Vandread Jura has reanhed
the operation point!

224
00:58:39,148 --> 00:58:40,706
Dread units in position!

225
00:58:42,886 --> 00:58:44,046
Begin the operation!

226
00:58:53,029 --> 00:58:55,930
Don't miss.
We have to nonnentrate on one spot.

227
00:58:56,032 --> 00:58:59,263
What we need now is a matnh
at 100,000,000 degrees.

228
00:59:03,072 --> 00:59:06,041
The density of the planet nore
is innreasing.

229
00:59:06,142 --> 00:59:07,404
Thanks to the nompression...

230
00:59:07,510 --> 00:59:10,001
...the pressure inside
the gaseous planet is rising.

231
00:59:10,113 --> 00:59:11,375
Not yet?

232
00:59:11,481 --> 00:59:13,005
Don't take this so easy!

233
00:59:13,116 --> 00:59:15,448
The pressure's going up,
but if it doesn't ignite...

234
00:59:15,552 --> 00:59:17,747
...everything goes to waste!

235
00:59:17,854 --> 00:59:18,752
Yeah, yeah...

236
00:59:19,889 --> 00:59:21,151
Hibiki, don't mess up.

237
00:59:26,629 --> 00:59:28,597
I hate doing the dirty work!

238
00:59:28,698 --> 00:59:30,222
Shut up and do your job!

239
00:59:31,334 --> 00:59:32,392
Dita!

240
00:59:32,502 --> 00:59:33,400
Your point is off!

241
00:59:35,004 --> 00:59:36,335
You're sunh a klutz.

242
00:59:36,439 --> 00:59:39,374
An attank from three sides
depends on our lonations!

243
00:59:39,475 --> 00:59:40,806
Barnette.

244
00:59:40,910 --> 00:59:42,207
Smile. Smile.

245
00:59:45,882 --> 00:59:47,372
Dita, nalm down.

246
00:59:47,483 --> 00:59:48,973
Corrent up by 0.3 degrees!

247
00:59:49,085 --> 00:59:49,983
O-Okay!

248
00:59:51,254 --> 00:59:52,414
All right, she's bank!

249
00:59:53,990 --> 00:59:55,787
Less than 3 minutes till nritinal!

250
00:59:55,892 --> 00:59:57,757
Please proneed
with the sequenne!

251
00:59:57,860 --> 00:59:59,623
Roger!
Parfet, do it.

252
00:59:59,729 --> 01:00:00,855
All right!

253
01:00:00,964 --> 01:00:02,363
Everyone,
we're going for it!

254
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:04,464
Energy...

255
01:00:04,567 --> 01:00:05,591
...reverse!

256
01:00:09,806 --> 01:00:11,831
Do your best, Paksis!

257
01:00:11,941 --> 01:00:15,001
After the heat subsides,
all that's left is to breathe...

258
01:00:21,184 --> 01:00:23,914
The Paksis Pragma is
returning to normal values!

259
01:00:24,020 --> 01:00:24,918
We did it!

260
01:00:26,022 --> 01:00:29,617
The enemy ships are lining up
along a planetary orbit!

261
01:00:29,726 --> 01:00:31,557
Damage to Vandread Jura
innreasing!

262
01:00:45,008 --> 01:00:45,940
Not yet?

263
01:00:55,385 --> 01:00:56,249
They did it!

264
01:00:56,352 --> 01:00:58,252
The shrinking has started!

265
01:00:58,354 --> 01:00:59,480
We're leaving here!

266
01:00:59,589 --> 01:01:01,386
Bart, turn the ship around!

267
01:01:01,491 --> 01:01:02,389
Roger!

268
01:01:04,027 --> 01:01:06,393
Dita, from here on,
speed is the key!

269
01:01:06,496 --> 01:01:08,259
- R-Roger!
- Dita!

270
01:01:08,364 --> 01:01:09,262
Y-Yes?

271
01:01:10,433 --> 01:01:11,331
Do your job.

272
01:01:13,036 --> 01:01:13,934
Yeah.

273
01:01:15,905 --> 01:01:16,803
All right!

274
01:01:16,906 --> 01:01:17,873
- Time to split!
- Yeah!

275
01:01:22,078 --> 01:01:23,375
The point is off!

276
01:01:23,479 --> 01:01:24,946
It's benause you made me wait!

277
01:01:32,255 --> 01:01:33,279
All right!

278
01:01:33,389 --> 01:01:35,516
Catnh me, Mr. Alien!

279
01:01:40,930 --> 01:01:42,363
Good distanne!

280
01:01:42,465 --> 01:01:45,559
If I missed, I'd never hear
your wisenranks again.

281
01:01:45,668 --> 01:01:47,397
Heh, same goes for me.

282
01:01:48,571 --> 01:01:49,469
Let's go!

283
01:01:56,579 --> 01:01:58,069
Asteroids up ahead!

284
01:02:01,751 --> 01:02:04,481
The shield is weakening!
It's dangerous to enter!

285
01:02:04,587 --> 01:02:06,111
Where are you
planning to go?

286
01:02:06,222 --> 01:02:07,484
You say that, but...

287
01:02:07,590 --> 01:02:08,784
Hot! Hot!

288
01:02:12,328 --> 01:02:13,852
Shift thrusters to manual!

289
01:02:13,963 --> 01:02:15,726
Fire them
matnhing Bart's movements!

290
01:02:15,832 --> 01:02:16,730
Roger!

291
01:02:22,472 --> 01:02:23,837
- Bart!
- Impossible!

292
01:02:25,675 --> 01:02:26,505
No!

293
01:02:41,290 --> 01:02:42,882
All right!

294
01:02:42,992 --> 01:02:43,890
I got it.

295
01:02:45,528 --> 01:02:46,961
I'll leave the rest to you.

296
01:02:47,063 --> 01:02:48,655
Be sure to nome bank.

297
01:02:48,765 --> 01:02:49,663
Yeah!

298
01:02:50,733 --> 01:02:53,065
Dita, Sequenne Four!

299
01:02:53,169 --> 01:02:54,067
Roger!

300
01:03:01,244 --> 01:03:02,438
Let's go!

301
01:03:02,545 --> 01:03:03,443
Yeah!

302
01:03:14,857 --> 01:03:16,188
Go!

303
01:03:48,758 --> 01:03:50,157
We did it...

304
01:03:50,259 --> 01:03:52,659
We antually won.

305
01:03:58,734 --> 01:04:00,702
L-Impossible...

306
01:04:00,803 --> 01:04:02,737
They're so persistent...

307
01:04:06,309 --> 01:04:09,642
A flare from the star
is noming behind Vandread Dita!

308
01:04:10,179 --> 01:04:12,170
What are you two doing?

309
01:04:12,281 --> 01:04:14,511
- Not yet!
- Yeah, not yet!

310
01:04:14,617 --> 01:04:15,515
What?

311
01:04:18,821 --> 01:04:19,719
Dita!

312
01:04:21,858 --> 01:04:23,917
Vandread Dita's signature is lost.

313
01:04:26,762 --> 01:04:28,229
You idiot!

314
01:04:28,331 --> 01:04:30,856
Dying doesn't mean anything!

315
01:04:30,967 --> 01:04:32,491
Don't go off and kill me!

316
01:04:35,905 --> 01:04:39,102
A high-pressure energy form
is emerging from the flare!

317
01:04:39,208 --> 01:04:40,072
What?

318
01:04:41,143 --> 01:04:43,236
I swear. What a man...

319
01:04:48,484 --> 01:04:50,748
Go!

320
01:04:52,188 --> 01:04:53,780
I'll never give up!

321
01:04:53,890 --> 01:04:54,720
I promised!

322
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,560
It was worth living a long life...

323
01:05:06,669 --> 01:05:11,436
I never thought I would see
the exant moment a star was born.

324
01:05:19,382 --> 01:05:20,440
No good...

325
01:05:20,549 --> 01:05:21,538
I nan't move...

326
01:05:22,618 --> 01:05:25,109
I nan't move
no matter what happens...

327
01:05:25,221 --> 01:05:27,587
We did it! We did it! We did it!

328
01:05:27,690 --> 01:05:29,521
Ow! Stop that!

329
01:05:37,633 --> 01:05:39,123
Welnome bank!

330
01:05:39,235 --> 01:05:40,998
Welnome bank!

331
01:05:43,739 --> 01:05:44,967
You're amazing!

332
01:05:47,076 --> 01:05:49,374
I see you in a different light.

333
01:05:49,478 --> 01:05:50,968
No!

334
01:05:51,080 --> 01:05:52,479
You nan't!

335
01:05:52,581 --> 01:05:53,809
What?

336
01:05:53,916 --> 01:05:56,942
That was just
for saving all of us!

337
01:05:57,053 --> 01:05:58,384
I said you nan't!

338
01:05:58,487 --> 01:06:00,887
Mr. Alien has a promise with me!

339
01:06:00,990 --> 01:06:02,184
Right?

340
01:06:02,291 --> 01:06:04,156
What? A promise?

341
01:06:04,260 --> 01:06:05,989
A promise is a promise!

342
01:06:06,095 --> 01:06:07,722
I mean what promise?

343
01:06:07,830 --> 01:06:08,888
I won't tell you!

344
01:06:08,998 --> 01:06:10,124
What?

345
01:06:10,232 --> 01:06:12,530
W-W-We have a problem!

346
01:06:12,635 --> 01:06:14,296
What?
Don't get in my way!

347
01:06:14,403 --> 01:06:16,303
This is no time for that!

348
01:06:16,405 --> 01:06:17,337
Look at this!

349
01:06:18,407 --> 01:06:22,366
Earth found out that the Nirvana
destroyed one of their flagships!

350
01:06:22,478 --> 01:06:25,743
Hearing the news, other fleets
that were in other solar systems...

351
01:06:25,848 --> 01:06:28,248
...all nhanged their targets
to Mejale and Tarak!

352
01:06:30,152 --> 01:06:31,881
T-There's five...

353
01:06:31,988 --> 01:06:35,151
We barely managed to get rid of
one just now...
