*****This file should be named peach10.txt or peach10.zip******

Corrected EDITIONS of our etexts get a new NUMBER, peach11.txt.
VERSIONS based on separate sources get new LETTER, peach10a.txt.


We are now trying to release all our books one month in advance
of the official release dates, for time for better editing.

Please note:  neither this list nor its contents are final till
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.  To be sure you have an
up to date first edition [xxxxx10x.xxx] please check file sizes
in the first week of the next month.  Since our ftp program has
a bug in it that scrambles the date [tried to fix and failed] a
look at the file size will have to do, but we will try to see a
new copy has at least one byte more or less.


Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
fifty hours is one conservative estimate for how long it we take
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-two text
files per month:  or 400 more Etexts in 1996 for a total of 800.
If these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the
total should reach 80 billion Etexts.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by the December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000=Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only 10% of the present number of computer users.  2001
should have at least twice as many computer users as that, so it
will require us reaching less than 5% of the users in 2001.

Peach Blossom Shangri-la (Tao Hua Yuan Ji)

Peach Blossom Shangri-la (Tao Hua Yuan Ji)

By Tao Yuanming [1]

During the Taiyuan era [2] of the Jin Dynasty [3] there was a 
man of Wuling [4] who made his living as a fisherman.  Once 
while following a stream he forgot how far he had gone. He 
suddenly came to a grove of blossoming peach trees. It lined 
both banks for several hundred paces and included not a 
single other kind of tree. Petals of the dazzling and 
fragrant blossoms were falling everywhere in profusion. 
Thinking this place highly unusual, the fisherman advanced 
once again in wanting to see how far it went.

The peach trees stopped at the stream's source, where the 
fisherman came to a mountain with a small opening through 
which it seemed he could see light.  Leaving his boat, he 
entered the opening.  At first it was so narrow that he could 
barely pass, but after advancing a short distance it suddenly 
opened up to reveal a broad, flat area with imposing houses, 
good fields, beautiful ponds, mulberry trees, bamboo, and the 
like.  The fisherman saw paths extending among the fields in 
all directions, and could hear the sounds of chickens and 
dogs.  Men and women working in the fields all wore clothing 
that looked like that of foreign lands.  The elderly and 
children all seemed to be happy and enjoying themselves.

The people were amazed to see the fisherman, and they asked 
him from where he had come.  He told them in detail, then the 
people invited him to their home, set out wine, butchered a 
chicken [5], and prepared a meal.  Other villagers heard 
about the fisherman, and they all came to ask him questions.  
Then the villagers told him, "To avoid the chaos of war 
during the Qin Dynasty [6], our ancestors brought their 
families and villagers to this isolated place and never left 
it, so we've had no contact with the outside world."  They 
asked the fisherman what the present reign was.  They were 
not even aware of the Han Dynasty [7], let alone the Wei [8] 
and Jin.  The fisherman told them everything he knew in great 
detail, and the villagers were amazed and heaved sighs.  Then 
other villagers also invited the fisherman to their homes, 
where they gave him food and drink.  After several days 
there, the fisherman bid farewell, at which time some 
villagers told him, "It's not worth telling people on the 
outside about us." [9]

The fisherman exited through the opening, found his boat, and 
retraced his route while leaving markers to find this place 
again.  Upon his arrival at the prefecture town he went to 
the prefect and told him what had happened.  The prefect 
immediately sent a person to follow the fisherman and look 
for the trail markers, but they got lost and never found the 
way.

Liu Ziji [10] of Nanyang [11] was a person of noble 
character.  When he heard this story he was happy and planned 
to visit the Shangri-la, but he died of illness before he 
could accomplish it.  After that no one else ever looked for 
the place.

桃花源記

陶淵明

晉太元中武陵人捕魚為業。緣溪行﹐忘路之遠近。忽逢
桃花林﹐夾岸數百步中無雜樹﹐芳華鮮美落英繽紛。漁
人甚異之。復前行欲窮其林。林盡水源便得一山。山有
小口仿佛若有光。便捨船從口入。初極狹纔通人。復行
數十步豁然開朗。土地平礦屋舍儼然。有良田美池桑竹
之屬。阡陌交通雞犬相聞。其中往來種作。男女衣著悉
如外人。黃髮垂髫並怡然自樂。見漁人乃大驚問所從來。
具答之。便要還家為設酒殺雞作食。村中聞有此人咸來
問訊。自云先世避秦時亂率妻子邑人。來此絕境不復出
焉。遂與外人間隔。問今是何世乃不知有漢無論魏晉。
此人一一為具言所聞皆歎惋。餘人各復延至其家皆出酒
食。停數日辭去。此中人語云不足為外人道也。既出得
其船便扶向路處處誌之。及郡下詣太守說如此。太守即
遣人隨其往。尋向所誌遂迷不復得路。南陽劉子驥高尚
士也。聞之欣然規往未果尋病終。後遂無問津者。
