Oh no! My Sacred Jewels fragments have been taken away! Without the fragments, I can't go by to the modern era! Miroku, can you lend me one of your fragments? I have a test tomorrow! Sango?

<p>Sesshomaru is in pursuit of an old man and master sword-maker, hoping that he can force him to make a better sword than Tetsusaiga. Inuyasha and the gang escape with the old man, who later explains that he already made a sword for Sesshomaru called Tenseiga, which has magical healing properties.</p>

<p class="ttextb">Oddities</p>
<ul><li>In the previous episode, Kikyo only took Kagome’s necklace of part of the Sacred Jewel, which was calcified by Spider Head in episode 13. By right, after that episode, they had five more fragments, three of which from Miroku. So it is queer that they say that they would start from scratch.</li>
<li>This is the first appearance of A-Un, the two-headed reptilian-like horse that Jaken rides. It replaces the huge demon that was killed in episode 19.</li>
<li>This is probably the only time we see Sesshomaru smiling, and him actually riding on A-Un. </li>
<li>During the face off between Sesshomaru and Inuyasha, Shippo shouts to Kagome to get over to where they were as it was safer over there. (Miroku, Sango, Shippo and Kirara are under a tree, while Kagome and Totosai are behind Inuyasha) Myoga is on Miroku’s shoulder. When Kagome and Totosai join them, Myoga is on Totosai’s shoulder instead. Since Myoga, in dangerous situations, is always on the shoulder of the strongest member in the group, that might mean Totosai is stronger than he lets on…</li>
<li>&quot;Oh no…the blood’s rushed to his head…This is bad.&quot;  
  : These were Myoga's last words before he disappeared. After Totosai used his hammer attack to help the group escape from the scene, Myoga is no longer seen in the later part of the episode, including the part when the group was eating by the river.</li></ul>
<p><b>Comments</b></p>
<ul><li>Have you wondered what if Inuyasha inherited Tenseiga and Sesshomaru inherited Tetsusaiga instead? Why did their father give the half-demon brother a destructive sword and the other a healing sword?</li></ul></td>

<p class="txtb"><a name="_ACT_I_"></a>[ ACT I ]</p>
<p>Nighttime. Against the backdrop of a gigantic moon, a ‘moo’ is heard. A skinny old man with big eyes and a long hammer rides on a cow.</p>
<p class="txt">Old Man: Hey, Myoga… I hope you’re not deceiving me. Has this Inu-whatever really mastered the Tetsusaiga?</p>
<p class="txt">MYO:&emsp; (hopping on the cow) His name is Master Inuyasha.</p>
<p class="txt">Old Man: Inuyasha? Oh, I remember. The son of the Dog General who gave me his fang from which to forge the sword. Is he the younger of the two doltish brothers?</p>
<p class="txt">MYO:&emsp; (stern with folded arms) Watch your mouth. It happened only once—but with one swing, he killed a hundred demons.</p>
<p>Flashback of episode 28.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (picking up TET) Being accused of abandoning you… (TET transforms, cut to back view of INU facing a HUGE demon swarm) isn’t something I’ll enjoy waking up to in the morning! (INU swings the TET and annihilates the swarm)</p>
<p>Back to MYO and old man.</p>
<p class="txt">MYO:&emsp; But there’s been nothing ever since. And I’m stumped as to what to do next.</p>
<p class="txt">Old Man: (stroking his beard) Well then…maybe I should just test him to see whether he’s deserving of the famous Tetsusaiga which I forged.</p>
<p>MYO, the old man and cow ride into the night.</p>

<p class="txtb"><a name="_ACT_II_"></a>[ ACT II ]</p>
<p>Nighttime in a forest surrounding a volcano. Cut to a ground with potholes of lava simmering.</p>
<p class="txt">JAK:&emsp;&ensp; (hopping over the potholes) H-hot…! H-hot!</p>
<p>Cut to close-up of a nervous and sweating JAK.</p>
<p class="txt">JAK:&emsp;&ensp; What a place this is! Even the rocky ground is burning hot! (fumes appear from beneath) Mmm…the smell of roasting meat. (looks down to find his feet burnt to a orange glow) Hmm?</p>
<p>JAK sprints across the ground in tears and perspiration, i.e. pathetically. He trips and lands face down on the ground. His body starts to burst into flames upon contact with the ground. He gets up immediately and runs (with smoke fumes trailing him) towards a cave. The cave looks ominous, with teeth-like protrusions from the edges of the entrance. He reaches it and stops to catch his breath.</p>
<p class="txt">JAK:&emsp;&ensp; Oh, this is it! Are you here, Totosai? I hope you have completed the sword that was commissioned! This is the promised date of delivery! (looks into the empty cave) Hey! Come on out! (walks into cave and notices something) Huh? (notices a big rock with some Japanese characters engraved onto it) “Moved”?! (runs out of the cave) Damn that sneaky badger! Where’d he go?! (hearing footsteps behind him) Oh…Oops. (turns around apprehensively)</p>
<p class="txt">SES:&emsp;&nbsp; I see… So Totosai has run away.</p>
<p class="txt">JAK:&emsp;&ensp; (kowtowing desperately) Please forgive me, Master Sesshomaru! The sword smith Totosai is a man of extreme likes and dislikes. From what I have heard, he will create a sword only if he takes a liking to the client.</p>
<p class="txt">SES:&emsp;&nbsp; In other words, he has no intention of making a sword that suits me.</p>
<p class="txt">JAK:&emsp;&ensp; (nervously) Well… How can I put it… He doesn’t like you. (looks at SES and gasps in horror)</p>
<p>SES smiles.</p>
<p class="txt">JAK:&emsp;&ensp; Y-you’re smiling…! (hops frantically and kowtows) Oh please! Please get angry! I fear a smiling Master Sesshomaru much, much more! Please I beg you!</p>
<p>SES doesn’t respond. He turns around and walks off.</p>
<p class="txt">JAK:&emsp;&ensp; (to himself as he watches SES) My life was shortened by a hundred years.</p><br>
<p>INU-gang traveling around a path. INU walks in front with KAG, while SHI, MIR, SAN and cute KIR are in the back.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(pushing her bicycle) My Sacred Jewel fragments were taken…</p>
<p>Flashback of previous episode when KIK took KAG’s Sacred Jewel necklace. Back to present.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (stops and look at KAG) Don’t worry about it, Kagome.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;But…</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; That wasn’t all there is of the Sacred Jewel. We’ll start collecting ’em one by one again.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;(whispering to MIR) That’s so unlike Inuyasha. Why’s he being so understanding?</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Well, because the one who stole the Sacred Jewel fragments was Kikyo.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; (on MIR’s shoulder, shaking head) (sighs) Geez… A crime committed by the woman he loves!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (turns around) Hey you! (angry) Are you implying that I’m trying to defend Kikyo? (turns to KAG) W-what?! Do you think that, too—?!</p>
<p>KAG looks at INU apprehensively and zooms far away from him. (zoom as in no animation, just an image getting smaller and smaller)</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (exasperated) If you have any complaints, just speak up!</p>
<p>A mooing sound is heard.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;(turns back) A cow?</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; (looks around) Where is it?</p>
<p>Another mooing sound.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI, MIR and SAN: (looking up, astonished) Up above?</p>
<p>Up in the sky, a flash of lightning appears and zaps the ground. Smoke fumes result from the impact.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; What’s going on?!</p>
<p>The old man on the three-eyed cow appears when the smoke starts to dissipate.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(hides behind INU) Inuyasha!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Just who are you?!</p>
<p class="txt">Old Man: (deadpan) I am called Totosai. Draw your sword, Inuyasha.</p>
<p class="ttable">* Totosai abbreviated as TOT from now onwards *</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (thinking) The old geezer…knows me?!</p>
<p class="txt">TOT:&emsp;&nbsp; If you refuse, I’ll go on the offensive! (waves hammer in the air and leaps off the cow towards INU)</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Get back, Kagome!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(hesitant) Uh-huh…</p>
<p>INU draws TET which transforms. TOT’s hammer hits the blade. INU is pushed backwards by the force. The impact of the hammer makes the blade vibrates and makes a sound. SHI gasps in astonishment.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR &amp; SAN: (in defensive postures) He thwarted the Tetsusaiga with his hammer!</p>
<p class="txt">TOT:&emsp;&nbsp; (lands and swings his hammer with both hands) The resonance is way too dull. (falling from side to side) Maybe this kid isn’t the right one. (scratches his head)</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (agitated) Just who are you?! (rushes towards TOT)</p>
<p>TOT nonchalantly takes out a leather strip from his kimono and licks it. INU attempts to attack TOT, who blocks the sword with the leather strip. INU is shocked.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; He stopped the sword!</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;With a piece of leather!</p>
<p class="txt">TOT:&emsp;&nbsp; (sighing while he examines the sword) The blade is full of chips! You’ve been too rough with it! (rubs the leather strip along the blade edge) What a shame!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; J-just who are you?!</p>
<p class="txt">MYO:&emsp; (jumping onto INU’s shoulder) Totosai, isn’t that enough?</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Myoga?!</p><br>
<p>INU-gang sits on a meadow with TOT and his cow.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; The sword smith who forged the Tetsusaiga?!</p>
<p class="txt">TOT:&emsp;&nbsp; Precisely. I, Totosai, forged the Tetsusaiga from a fang your father gave me. In the world of sword-wielding demons, I am famous among those who know, and among those who don’t know, I’m not.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (folded arms) Huh? What does that mean?</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Doesn’t that mean he’s not very famous at all?</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Whatever…! Just what does the sword smith want with me?</p>
<p class="txt">TOT:&emsp;&nbsp; (folded arms) I took a good look at the Tetsusaiga earlier. (closes eyes) It was the sword of swords, forged by a master sword smith, but the sound of the steel is terribly dull. (droops head sadly) It’s a very sad thing.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (indignant) If you’re picking a fight, just say so.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(disapprovingly) Inuyasha!</p>
<p class="txt">TOT:&emsp;&nbsp; (sighs) Oh…it’s useless. Myoga, the Tetsusaiga can’t be used by someone so short-tempered and so eager to fight.</p>
<p class="txt">MYO:&emsp; (leaps onto TOT’s lap) So rather than blinding relying on the Tetsusaiga’s strength and fighting recklessly, better for Inuyasha to just give up the sword, huh? (droops head)</p>
<p class="txt">TOT:&emsp;&nbsp; (matter-of-fact-ly) Well, the sooner the better. I’ll just break the Tetsusaiga in two now!</p>
<p>INU stands up points the TET at TOT’s mouth threateningly. TOT leans backwards on his cow.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; What didja say?! You may have made the sword, but now, it belongs to me!</p>
<p class="txt">TOT:&emsp;&nbsp; Oh, I won’t break it. Sorry about that.</p>
<p>INU draws back the TET.</p>
<p class="txt">MYO:&emsp; Stop hedging. What are you going to do?</p>
<p class="txt">TOT:&emsp;&nbsp; (softly to MYO) At night, when everyone has settled down, I will quietly steal it away. (INU points the TET at his mouth again) Oh, no… I won’t steal it!</p>
<p class="txt">MYO:&emsp; Master Inuyasha, as it is, you won’t be able to master the mystery of the Tetsusaiga which enables one to slay a hundred demons in one sweep. But this Totosai knows its secret. I think you both need to get to know each other and you must cooperate to awaken the Tetsusaiga’s true power.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (slings TET over his shoulder) What mystery?! I’ll get the hang of it in time. (proud)</p>
<p class="txt">TOT:&emsp;&nbsp; You are collecting fragments of the Sacred Jewel. Some time has passed since the fragments were scattered. There may even be a demon who already possesses two or three fragments. In order to destroy a demon whose strength is enhanced, don’t you want the Tetsusaiga to be awakened to its true potential?</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Inuyasha, he has a point.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;I think you should listen to him.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (scoffs) Awright! (sheathes TET) So what’m I supposed to do, Totosai?</p>
<p class="txt">TOT:&emsp;&nbsp; Someone seeks my life!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Huh?!</p>
<p class="txt">TOT:&emsp;&nbsp; There is a fool who has ordered me to forge a sword to rival the power of the Tetsusaiga…else he will kill me. Show me that you can protect me from him.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (grabs TOT’s face and shakes it) Why don’t you say “please”?!</p>
<p class="txt">MYO:&emsp; I never heard of that! Describe this person.</p>
<p class="txt">TOT:&emsp;&nbsp; He has white hair and wears furry, warm-looking clothing.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (hand still on TOT’s face) What?! Another old geezer?</p>
<p class="txt">TOT:&emsp;&nbsp; (squeezes his lips and makes a long boo sound) Wrong!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Wait a minute…If he’s dressed like that…and not old…and he wants a sword stronger than the Tetsusaiga…Could he be…?!</p>
<p class="txt">TOT:&emsp;&nbsp; (a sweat drop appears and he turns his head) He’s here!</p>
<p>A light glimmers in the sky. SES appears, riding on a two-head reptilian horse.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (taken aback) Sesshomaru!</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Who is he?</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Inuyasha’s older brother.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;So he is the one who’s after you!</p>
<p class="txt">TOT:&emsp;&nbsp; Exactly! It’s that Sesshomaru! (hides behind INU)</p>
<p class="txt">SES:&emsp;&nbsp; Inuyasha…why do you plot with Totosai?</p>
<p class="txt">TOT:&emsp;&nbsp; (peeping his head from behind INU) Isn’t it obvious? To punish you!</p>
<p class="txt">SES:&emsp;&nbsp; Oh, Totosai…I see you are rushing headlong into death.</p>
<p class="txt">TOT:&emsp;&nbsp; (hides completely behind INU, breaking in sweat) Oh no…I just thought after you beat Inuyasha, maybe I can make you a new sword…</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; What?</p>
<p class="txt">TOT:&emsp;&nbsp; Just a thought…</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(angry) Hey! What you said earlier is the exact opposite!</p>
<p class="txt">TOT:&emsp;&nbsp; (scratches head) Huh? Is that so?</p>
<p class="txt">SES:&emsp;&nbsp; Totosai, do not forget what you just said. (flies off his horse) You heard him, Inuyasha. You can die for the sake of my new sword.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; (rushes forward with SAN) Kagome, hurry and get away!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Uh-huh…(runs away from INU)</p>
<p>TOT rushes off from behind INU too. SES attacks INU ruthlessly.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (dodges and draws TET) I’ll kill you instead!</p>
<p>INU swings several times at SES, who dodges his attacks effortlessly. Cut to TOT and KAG.</p>
<p class="txt">TOT:&emsp;&nbsp; They are both so hot-headed…</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(clenches fist in anger) You’re the one who instigated this!</p>
<p class="txt">TOT:&emsp;&nbsp; (gasps in utter astonishment) Oh…is that right?</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;You! (thinking) No wonder he’s Old Myoga’s friend! Acting so innocent! (realizing) Huh? Old Myoga… (looks around) Where are you, Myoga?</p>
<p>Cut to MIR. A circle is highlighting MYO who is perching on MIR. MIR, SAN and the cow are standing by a tree. SHI sits with cute KIR on the cow.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; Kagome, Old Myoga is on Miroku’s shoulder. Hurry here! It’s dangerous over there!</p>
<p>Cut to KAG and TOT. KAG gasps in terror and starts to run towards them. TOT grabs her collar.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Huh? Hey, what’re you doing?! (TOT picks up his hammer and runs ahead of her) How awful!</p>
<p>Cut to INU’s fight with SES, who is fighting with a whip. INU yells and leaps into the air to attack.</p>
<p class="txt">SES:&emsp;&nbsp; (dodges and flies into the air) Too slow.</p>
<p>SES charges down at INU and releases poisonous gas. INU covers his mouth and chokes. SES appears right next to him and punches him in the face. INU crashes onto the ground. Cut to the rest who are getting worried for INU.</p>
<p class="txt">TOT:&emsp;&nbsp; Gotta be kidding! No good at all! (turns to MYO who is perched on TOT’s shoulder) Hey, Myoga, has Inuyasha really mastered the Tetsusaiga?</p>
<p class="txt">MYO:&emsp; (hopping) Well, just once.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(hands on hip) It’s not a lie! (clenches one fist in determination) Besides, each time it’s Inuyasha who ends up beating Sesshomaru!</p>
<p class="txt">TOT:&emsp;&nbsp; (glances sideways at KAG suspiciously) Miss, are you sure you haven’t been dreaming?</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(takes TOT’s hammer and hits TOT on the head) I am not like you!</p>
<p class="txt">TOT:&emsp;&nbsp; (huge bump grows on his head) Pardon me.</p>
<p>Cut to SES.</p>
<p class="txt">SES:&emsp;&nbsp; Totosai…do you not feel sad for the Tetsusaiga? The famous sword is no better than a piece of log. All Inuyasha does is swing it around.</p>
<p>Cut scene of a rusty sword.</p>
<p class="txt">SES:&emsp;&nbsp; (voice-over) Depending on its user, a sword can live or die.</p>
<p>The sword transforms and swings. Cut to Totosai clasping his ears and nodding.</p>
<p class="txt">TOT:&emsp;&nbsp; A wise observation… my opinions precisely.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Don’t agree!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Damn! You can cut your jokes. (getting up) I’m only warming up! Don’t be shocked at my real power! (runs towards SES) Prepare yourself!</p>
<p>INU swings TET several times at SES, who again dodges effortlessly. Cut to a disappointed MYO.</p>
<p class="txt">MYO:&emsp; Oh no…the blood’s rushed to his head…This is bad.</p>
<p>Cut to SES, who grabs INU’s arm (the one holding TET) and releases poison.</p>
<p class="txt">SES:&emsp;&nbsp; Well…Totosai, do you still refuse to make me a sword?</p>
<p>Cut to a pondering TOT, with sweat drops across his forehead. He pauses and makes a ‘ummm’ sound.</p>
<p class="txt">TOT:&emsp;&nbsp; (shakes head suddenly) No way!</p>
<p>TOT puffs up his cheeks and leaps into the air, while blowing rings of flames at the fighting brothers. SES notices and flies out of the firing range. INU turns around to see what’s going on, only to be barbequed by the flames. TOT (who landed) puffs his cheeks again.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (walks to TOT and raises his fist, yelling) What’re you doing, stupid?!</p>
<p>INU punches TOT on the head, which makes him ‘leak’ small streaks of fire out of his mouth and ears. A whistling sound similar to that of kettle boiling is heard. INU glares at the strange scene.</p>
<p class="txt">SES:&emsp;&nbsp; (landing) So you absolutely refuse?</p>
<p class="txt">TOT:&emsp;&nbsp; (infuriated and points a finger at SES) Shut up! I have already made you a fine sword! (squints at SES while INU is shocked by what he said) That famous sword at your hip: Tenseiga!</p>
<p>Cut to SES’s sword.</p>
<p class="txt">TOT:&emsp;&nbsp; I, Totosai, made the sword from a fang given to me by your father! The Tenseiga for the older brother, the Tetsusaiga for the younger one, that was your father’s last will.</p>
<p>Cut to everyone on the field.</p>
<p class="txt">TOT:&emsp;&nbsp; It is a great sword of swords, no worse and no better than the Tetsusaiga! (furious) Why don’t you learn to love it more!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;So that old man also made Sesshomaru’s sword!</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; However, in all the battles until now, I’ve never seen Sesshomaru unsheathe that sword.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;You’re right…</p>
<p class="txt">SES:&emsp;&nbsp; You dare imply that this stupid, useless sword is worthy of me?! (glares furiously)</p>
<p class="txt">TOT:&emsp;&nbsp; Oh! He’s angry! He’s angry! (laughs and swings his hammer) I guess I’ll take my leave…!</p>
<p>TOT leaps into the air raising his hammer and slams it violently on the ground. The impact breaks the ground and sends a torrent of lava and rocks towards SES. SES leaps away. TOT fades away among the smoke fumes with INU-gang. The ground is reduced to pools of lava.</p>
<p class="txt">SES:&emsp;&nbsp; They’ve escaped.</p><br>
<p>Cut to SAN, MIR and SHI riding on a transformed KIR. INU and KAG ride behind TOT on his three-eyed cow.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(impressed) Wow! You’re so strong!</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; I’ll say. Why bother to have Inuyasha to protect you when he’s weaker than Sesshomaru?</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (riled) What did you say?</p>
<p class="txt">TOT:&emsp;&nbsp; (sighs and groans sadly) How could Sesshomaru call his great sword useless, how could Inuyasha be so weak, how utterly wrong I was about them both!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; What?! (socks TOT on his head several times)</p>
<p class="txt">TOT:&emsp;&nbsp; (looks at INU with several simmering bumps on his head) Owee!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; I am not weak!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(serious) Old one…I’ve been thinking. That sword Sesshomaru has, is it also a powerful sword?</p>
<p class="txt">TOT:&emsp;&nbsp; You mean, the Tenseiga? You could say its power is awesome indeed. But when the Dog General commissioned me to make it, I questioned at first about its powers.</p><br>
<p>Cut to evening scene. The group is sitting by a river. TOT is roasting food with his fire flames.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; A sword that won’t cut? How’re you suppose to fight with a sword like that?</p>
<p class="txt">TOT:&emsp;&nbsp; The Tenseiga is not a sword you use against foes. To put it simply, it is a sword of healing.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Healing?</p>
<p class="txt">TOT:&emsp;&nbsp; While the Tetsusaiga is the sword to defeat the powerful, the Tenseiga is the sword to save the lives of the weak.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Save lives?</p>
<p class="txt">TOT:&emsp;&nbsp; If one has the true kindness of heart towards people, the Tenseiga has the power to save a hundred in one sweep.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Kindness of heart?</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; The Tetsusaiga can kill a hundred in one sweep while the Tenseiga can save a hundred in one sweep…?</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;And does this sword function as a weapon?</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; It is able to bring back dead souls. In this Feudal era, it can be used in many ways.</p>
<p class="txt">TOT:&emsp;&nbsp; I intended to name the sword “Coffin-Cheater”, but it was christened with a fancy name like Tenseiga. (scratches head) Well, it was your father that named it.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; I see…No wonder Sesshomaru wants a new sword. A sword to help others, no way that guy’d have any use for it.</p>
<p class="txt">TOT:&emsp;&nbsp; (droops head in disappointment) Won’t it work out…? It was your father’s will.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Given your brother’s personality…</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;He wouldn’t be happy with it, even if he could use it.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; (looking at the roast with KIR) Looks delicious!</p>
<p class="txt">TOT:&emsp;&nbsp; (noticing) A very nice roast, indeed! Let’s dig in!</p>
<p>The group moves closer to the roast. TOT takes the entire roast and stuffs it into his mouth. He chews twice and swallows it whole.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Hey! Don’t eat it all!</p>
<p class="txt">TOT:&emsp;&nbsp; (looks at the fire) Oh! My meat’s gone!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(points finger) You just ate it all!</p>
<p class="txt">TOT:&emsp;&nbsp; Huh? Who are you anyway? And where am I?</p>
<p>MIR coolly thumps him on the head with his staff.</p><br>
<p>Nighttime, JAK and SES walking in a swamp.</p>
<p class="txt">JAK:&emsp;&ensp; I was not aware of it, either, that the sword is also your father’s memento. What kind of power does it have?</p>
<p class="txt">SES:&emsp;&nbsp; (stops) You want to know, Jaken?</p>
<p class="txt">JAK:&emsp;&ensp; (stops a few steps in front of SES) It makes me extremely curious about the two swords forged from your father’s fang. The two swords are like…brothers. (realizes his faux pass and gasps) Oh no… I didn’t mean to compare them with you and Inuyasha! I’m not concerned at all that you who hate half-demons would be related to Inuyasha…well, I am concerned, but…!</p>
<p class="txt">SES:&emsp;&nbsp; Jaken!</p>
<p class="txt">JAK:&emsp;&ensp; Yes?</p>
<p>JAK turns around to look at SES. SES unsheathes his Tenseiga and slashes JAK in a pink light.</p>
<p class="txt">JAK:&emsp;&ensp; (falling backwards) Lord Sesshomaru!</p>
<p>The pink light slash on JAK slowly disappears.</p>
<p class="txt">SES:&emsp;&nbsp; What are you doing? Get up.</p>
<p class="txt">JAK:&emsp;&ensp; (realizing he’s not dead) Huh? (gets up and checks himself) I’m not hurt! Why? I was slain just now!</p>
<p class="txt">SES:&emsp;&nbsp; Do you see now? This Tenseiga is a sword that cannot kill! (sheathes Tenseiga)</p>
<p class="txt">JAK:&emsp;&ensp; Wh-what? (a current starts to swirl in a pond in front of them) What’s happening?</p>
<p>A dragon appears from the swirl.</p>

<p>The dragon attacks. SES dodges and leaps into the air, while JAK swiftly runs away. SES flies to eye-level with dragon, pulls out his whip and attacks. The whip slices the dragon into two, and SES claws it. The dragon falls. SES tears off one of its arms.</p>

<p>Morning in the forest.</p>
<p class="txt">TOT:&emsp;&nbsp; (pushes his cow and gets on) There! (turns back to INU-gang) See you!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;See you? You plan to escape alone?</p>
<p class="txt">TOT:&emsp;&nbsp; I can’t rely on Inuyasha.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Come on—</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Leave ‘im! Who needs an old geezer like that?</p>
<p class="txt">TOT:&emsp;&nbsp; (ponders awhile and gets off the cow) Give it back! (walks up to INU and grabs TET) You cannot use the Tetsusaiga! I will break it into pieces.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (socks TOT on the head) Shaddup, you geezer!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(disapprovingly) Hey, Inuyasha!</p>
<p class="txt">TOT:&emsp;&nbsp; (escapes to his cow) You’ll regret this! (whips it with his hammer and they zoom off)</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; He’s frank, isn’t he?</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;I can’t tell whether that old man is strong or weak.</p>
<p>Cut to TOT riding on his cow, moving swiftly.</p>
<p class="txt">TOT:&emsp;&nbsp; (thinking) Poor thing… That Inuyasha will be killed by Sesshomaru. After all, Inuyasha hasn’t even been able to see the “Wind Scar” which awakens the Tetsusaiga’s power.</p>
<p>Cut to INU-gang moving on.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Aren’t you going after him, Inuyasha? You were lucky enough to meet the Tetsusaiga’s maker!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (scoffs keh) Hah! That old fool is full of it!</p>
<p>TOT appears from the horizon and runs towards them.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;He’s back.</p>
<p>A light orb appears behind TOT and his cow. It crashes into them, sending both of them flying. It is SES.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Sesshomaru!</p>
<p class="txt">SES:&emsp;&nbsp; Stay put! I will tear both you and Inuyasha into pieces!</p>
<p class="txt">TOT:&emsp;&nbsp; (gets up and hides behind INU) Did you hear that? What’ll you do?</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Old one…you don’t want to make Sesshomaru a new sword, right?</p>
<p class="txt">TOT:&emsp;&nbsp; No!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Well then, I’ve had it up to here with all this about Tetsusaiga. It’s about time to settle this once and for all! (unsheathes TET, TOT runs to the rest of the gang)</p>
<p class="txt">SES:&emsp;&nbsp; (runs towards INU with a dragon claw) Rest assured. (clutches TET’s blade with the claw and sparks ensue) It will end today! As long as you cannot see the “Wind Scar.”</p>

<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Inuyasha's and Sesshomaru's father left a sword each, but Inuyasha inherited Tetsusaiga. This made Sesshomaru indignant. Inuyasha finally executed the Wind Scar! In one swing, he made Sesshomaru out of commission! Sesshomaru also used the Tenseiga for its healing abilities. Who exactly did he save?
