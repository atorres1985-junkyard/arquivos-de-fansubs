          The scene where Hakushin was lowered into a pit, so that he would become a Saint, is a true scenario, and not just some twisted story. While the Egyptians embalm their mummies only when they are dead, the Japanese Buddhist priests start while still alive. They would first go on a strict diet and slowly starve to death. During this time, they would meditate, surrounded by candles which serve to dry their bodies. Then they would be enclosed in an underground tomb for the final drying process. For an picture of a real mummified priest, click <a href="http://www.furinkan.com/iycompanion/misc/index.html" target="_blank">here</a>. <span class="contri">{Inu-Yasha Companion}</span></li>

<p>Night time. A purple light orb bursts out of a forest and crashes into an island in the middle of a large lake. The lake is near Mount Hakurei. Cut to fishing village across the island. Worried villagers rush out of their house.</p>
<p class="txt">Father:	Dad, you'll go to Hijiri Island?</p>
<p class="txt">Father:	Yeah! You stay here.</p>
<p class="txt">Boy:&emsp;&ensp; Why do you have to go there?</p>
<p class="txt">Father:	I'm going to make sure Saint Hakushin's shrine is alright.</p>
<p>The father rushes into a hut. The boy, concerned, runs after him. Cut to inside of hut. The father opens a box containing a staff inside.</p>
<p class="txt">Father:	This is the staff that was given by Saint Hakushin to our ancestor.</p>
<p class="txt">Boy:&emsp;&ensp; Dad, please bring me along!</p>
<p class="txt">Father:	Shintarou, please go home.</p>
<p class="ttable">Shintarou abbreviated as SHN from now onwards.</p>
<p class="txt">SHN:&emsp; But…</p>
<p class="txt">Father:	Listen to me… If anything happens to me, you as the only son of the village chief, you're the only one who is able to protect Hijiri Island.</p>
<p>Cut to SHN's father rowing a boat.</p>
<p class="txt">Father:	Don't worry. I'll be back by morning.</p>
<p class="txt">SHN:&emsp; (thinking) Father…</p>
<p>SHN stands at the water edge, looking worried as his father row towards Hijiri Island.</p>
<br>
<p class="txtb">[ Title screen: The Barrier of Hijiri Island, Floating on a Lake ]</p>
<br>
<p>Daytime. INU-gang (except SAN and KIR) is by a river. INU examines the water.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Inuyasha, how is it?</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; It's different. It wasn't this lake's scent. (thinking) Naraku's puppet was giving off the scent of water and flowers. Moreover, it had the same purity as Mount Hakurei.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Well, shall we look for other lakes?</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; I wonder if Sango and Kirara are okay.</p>
<p>The group looks towards Mount Hakurei in the distance.</p>
<br>
<p>Cut to SAN on KIR flying towards Mount Hakurei.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;(apprehensive) Mount Hakurei…</p>
<p>KIR flies nearer, but gets fried by a barrier. She is thrown back to the ground and lands, growling in pain.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;(pats KIR) Kirara, it's painful for you to pass through the barrier, isn't it? I'm sorry… Hang on for a while.</p>
<br>
<p>Cut to INU-gang walking. KIR lands near them.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;(runs to the rest) Everyone!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Sango!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;How did you do, Sango?</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;It's hopeless. Mount Hakurei's barrier is stronger than before.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; (frowns) Is it impossible to break through?</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Anyway, I'm sure that Naraku is nearby. Well, let's go through every single waterside around the mountain.</p>
<br>
<p>Cut to fishing village. SHN is talking to some fishermen.</p>
<p class="txt">SHN:&emsp; Please, let me take a boat out!</p>
<p class="txt">Fisherman 1: No way. You must carry out the duty as a leader of the village. We can't put you in any danger.</p>
<p class="txt">SHN:&emsp; But, it's been half a month and my Dad hasn't returned yet from Hijiri Island.</p>
<p class="txt">Fisherman 2: However, the only ones who can cross over to Hijiri Island are the men of your family, the village leaders. So, you're the only one.</p>
<p class="txt">SHN:&emsp; You just have to lend me a boat because I'll go by myself.</p>
<p class="txt">Fisherman 3: Perhaps your father offended the Saint?</p>
<p class="txt">Fisherman 2: The villagers won't be affected by that curse, will they?</p>
<p class="txt">SHN:&emsp; (mad) My father is a responsible leader of the village. He wouldn't do such an irresponsible thing!</p>
<p class="txt">Fisherman 1: If we went there, we would be cursed since Hijiri Island is a scared ground.</p>
<p>SHN looks exasperated and worried.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (background) Hey!</p>
<p>INU-gang walks up to the group.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Did you say sacred ground?</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Let's ask them about the story.</p>
<br>
<p>INU-gang are in SHN's house. His three sisters, Hana, Getsu and Yuki, are present too.</p>
<p class="txt">SHN:&emsp;  The middle of this lake is an island which normal people are unable to get near. Only males from the family of the village leader, have been allowed to go across to Hijiri Island to take care of Saint Hakushin.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Saint Hakushin?</p>
<p class="txt">SHN:&emsp; Yes, a great priest from over a hundred years ago…</p>
<p><span class="txtb">CUT TO FLASHBACK. </span>An old priest is lowered into a pit. A few priests prepare to cover the pit while villagers look on and pray. Children's singing are heard in the background.</p>
<p class="txt">Voices: (singing) Clean is dirty, as dirty is clean. Good is bad, as bad is good.</p>
<p>The old priest Hakushin holds up his hand in prayer as the pit is covered over him. The pit is then laid with stones.</p>
<p class="txt">SHN:&emsp; (voice-over) He became a Buddha incarnate after all. He was enshrined in a small shrine on the island.</p>
<p class="txtb">END OF FLASHBACK.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Buddha incarnate?</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; You're talking about a saint, aren't you? Some of the virtuous priests, abstain from all food and enter nirvana when their flesh mummifies.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; So, you get a dried up priest?</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; (chiding) Stop talking nonsense.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;You just mentioned that your father isn't back yet?</p>
<p class="txt">SHN:&emsp; Yes, it's been half a month. A weird light fell into that island. My dad was worried about the shrine.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Weird light?</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; It's probably Naraku.</p>
<p class="txt">Yuki:&emsp; (holds SHN's hands) Shintarou, it's impossible for you to do it by yourself.</p>
<p class="txt">SHN:&emsp; Sister… But, Father told me, &quot;If anything happens, please take care of it.&quot;</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; The fishermen said you would be cursed.</p>
<p class="txt">SHN:&emsp; (slams the ground angrily) The villagers aren't helpful at all! My dad is a responsible leader of the village. If he hasn't come back yet, there must be some reason for it!</p>
<p class="txt">Yuki:&emsp; Yes, we are worried about our father.</p>
<p class="txt">Getsu:	The villagers are scared of the curse.</p>
<p class="txt">Hana:&nbsp; It's truly troublesome!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Shall we check it out, Inuyasha?</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Yeah, we might get some clues about the sacred grounds.</p>
<p class="txt">SHN:&emsp; (glad) Really?! You'll go?</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; Of course! We know that you're worried about your father.</p>
<p class="txt">SHN:&emsp; Thank you! Then, I'll guide you across the water. Hijiri Island is always surrounded by fog, it's dangerous.</p>
<p class="txt">Yuki:&emsp; Please take care of our little brother.</p>
<p class="txt">Getsu:	Shintarou is the only make left in this family.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; (serious) Don't worry about that.</p>
<p>INU scratches his face knowingly.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; (holds Hana's hands) If you're fine with me, I shall let your sisters bear some baby boys.</p>
<p>SAN stands and thumps MIR on the head with HIR. INU, KAG and SHI look away. SHN and his sisters are shocked.</p>
<p class="txt">Hana:&nbsp; Is it really okay that we leave our younger brother to you?</p>
<br>
<p>Cut to INU shoving the three fishermen to the ground.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; You guys still have any complaints?</p>
<p class="txt">Fishermen: N-No…!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Wait a second, Inuyasha! Why are you threatening them? (smiles to fishermen) I'm sorry. We need to borrow a boat for a while.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (folds arms) We'll return it, don't worry!</p>
<p class="txtb">[ End of ACT I: 8min 32sec ]</p>
<br>
<p class="txtb"><a name="AII"></a>[ ACT II ]</p>
<p>INU-gang and SHN are on a boat towards Hijiri Island. INU is rowing. SHI is perched over the side, seasick. Cute KIR is on SAN's lap.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Could it be the ambience of the Hijiri Island? It's so strong that even Kirara was unable to transform.</p>
<p class="txt">SHN:&emsp; (singing) Living is death, as death is living; Inside the grave of Saint Hakushin; Mount Hakurei returns to Hijiri.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;What is that?</p>
<p class="txt">SHN:&emsp; It's a children's folk song passed down through generations. While Hakushin was still alive, he had very strong powers and saved many people in this area. Look. You can see Mount Hakurei over there. At the base of the mountain, there is a purifying place.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;A purifying place?</p>
<p class="txt">SHN:&emsp; It's where Hakushin opened a shrine. It's a place where any sin can be absolved if you pray.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (thinking) Again with Mount Hakurei?</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Mount Hakurei's barrier… I wonder who put it up.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;There must be someone who put up the barrier. However, the barrier is totally different from Naraku's.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(thinking) Yes, it must have been put up by a holy person. But what is the reason?</p>
<p>The boat approaches the island. Everyone looks gravely at the island, including INU.</p>
<p class="txt">SHN:&emsp; Hijiri Island. Be careful, there are rocks all around the island. If the boat scrapes against a rock…</p>
<p>Before SHN finishes talking, the boat crashed into a rock and a hole is made. Water gushes out of the bottom. The girls shriek.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (gaping at the hole) You should have said so earlier.</p>
<p>Cut to INU leaping with SHN under his arm and KAG on his back.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;The boat is borrowed…</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Stop complaining, or I'll leave you behind!</p>
<p>Cut to SHI perched over MIR's head, with his bushy tail covering MIR's eyes. MIR is chest deep in the lake.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; (dazed) I can't swim…</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Hey, Shippo, I can't see in front of me.</p>
<p>SAN, on the water bank, holds out HIR to MIR.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; This is?</p>
<p>SAN fishes MIR and SHI out.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Are you alright, Miroku?</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; (glad) You saved me.</p>
<p>SAN smiles. Cut to INU leaping through the air. Static surges and INU struggles to get through.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (struggling) This is the same barrier as Mount Hakurei. It's not that bad, though.</p>
<p>INU lands on the misty island. The entire ground of the island is covered with purple flowers. KAG and SHN are taken aback.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; There's no mistake. These flowers have the same scent as Naraku's puppet.</p>
<p class="txt">SHN:&emsp; (worried) There weren't flowers blooming like this before.</p>
<p>SAN and MIR walk up to them, with KIR and SHI in their arms respectively.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Are you okay, Shippo?</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; (weakly) I'm fine…</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Kirara seems to be in pain too.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (thinking) I really can't get it… Why did Naraku go through all that effort to bring out the puppet, just to let the Shichinintai run away? Furthermore, using a scent as a clue… Thanks to that, I'm able to step on sacred ground.</p>
<p>The mist dissipates a little to reveal a shrine up ahead.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;That is…?</p>
<p class="txt">SHN:&emsp; The shrine of the Saint! (runs towards shrine, thinking) It's broken… why?</p>
<p>SHN trips over something on the ground. It is a skeleton with its clothes still on.</p>
<p class="txt">SHN:&emsp; Father's… clothes… (shocked) F-Father!</p>
<p>KAG rushes to SHN and covers his face.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; It's been half a month since your father came to the island.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; It's impossible that he became a pile of bones so soon.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Could it be the actions of Naraku?</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Yeah, no doubt about it now.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;For what reasons, though?</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; There is nothing else on this island except the shrine…</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(gasps) The presence of Sacred Jewel fragments.</p>
<p>Light and static surge from the shrine and rush to INU-gang.</p>
<p class="txt">BKS:&emsp;&nbsp; (voice-over) Sheesh. You must be kidding. You made me wait here for such a long time!</p>
<p>Everyone manage to dodge the attack. BKS steps out of the shrine, looking pissed.</p>
<p class="txt">BKS:&emsp;&nbsp; Even a human like me feels bad here, it should be more painful for a half-demon like you, Inuyasha.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Bankotsu!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (grinds teeth, thinking) Damn… so it was a trap after all? (shouts) Are you the one who attacked this island, Bankotsu?!</p>
<p class="txt">BKS:&emsp;&nbsp; Don't blame me for that. I only came because I was told to wait here.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(notices the Shikon fragments in Banryuu) Be careful, Inuyasha. Bankotsu has Sacred Jewel fragments in his Banryuu sword!</p>
<p>INU is shocked.</p>
<p class="txt">BKS:&emsp;&nbsp; Since it was wounded in our match that day, I used them to mend it. Anyway, let's fight! (swings Banryuu)</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (unsheathes TET and sprints towards BKS) I'll cut you into pieces!</p>
<p>INU swings TET at BKS, who dodges and leaps in the air.</p>
<p class="txt">BKS:&emsp;&nbsp; That's what I should say!</p>
<p>BKS swings Banryuu downwards at INU, who blocks. Their blades clash and INU struggles to hold on.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Inuyasha is at a disadvantage!</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; It's because of the Sacred Jewel fragments that Bankotsu possesses.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; You bastard… (pushes BKS back and swings TET downwards) Wind Scar!</p>
<p>INU swings TET downwards to invoke the Wind Scar, but nothing happens. Only a  few flowers are thrust into the air. Everyone gapes in silence.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Wh-What…?</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Wind Scar… doesn't work?</p>
<p class="txt">BKS:&emsp;&nbsp; I see. Now I understand why I was told to fight here!</p>
<p>BKS attacks INU, who blocks with TET. They continue fighting.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Bastard!</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Why doesn't the Wind Scar work?</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Hijiri Island is purifying Tetsusaiga's demon powers. No matter how evil a zombie Bankotsu is, he is still a human. Compared to the demon blood which Inuyasha has, the effects of the sacred grounds should be minimal by far.</p>
<p>BKS attacks INU swiftly. INU can only block.</p>
<p class="txt">BKS:&emsp;&nbsp; Inuyasha, you're not as powerful as you used to be! Hurry up and go to hell! I want to get out of this annoying island!</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; (looks around, worried) There must be someone around here keeping this scared barrier intact. (looks at shrine, thinking) Could it be over there?</p>
<p>Banryuu and TET clash. BKS and INU try to push off each off. INU is struggling. SHN looks on. He pauses for a moment and runs towards the shrine determinedly.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Shintarou!</p>
<p class="txt">SHN:&emsp; Saint Hakushin, please save Inuyasha! (runs into shrine) This is… Father's…</p>
<br>
<p>Cut to inside of shrine, which is empty. The staff belonging SHN's dad is thrust onto the side of the altar.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(enters shrine) Shintarou!</p>
<p class="txt">SHN:&emsp; Saint Hakushin isn't here…! Is it missing…?</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Missing?!</p>
<p class="txt">SHN:&emsp; He was enshrined over there.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(thinking) What does this mean? Then, Naraku's purpose for attacking this island…?</p>
<br>
<p>KAG and SHN walk out of the shrine.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Miroku! Saint Hakushin has been taken. Naraku might have stolen the remains.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; The saint isn't here? So it wasn't Saint Hakushin?</p>
<p>SHI is still very weak. KIR growls in a low tone.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; (thinking) Who could be the one putting up Hijiri Island's sacred barrier?</p>
<p>Cut to INU and BKS fighting. BKS manages to cut INU on the arm.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Inuyasha!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (thinking) Damn!</p>
<br>
<p>Cut to inside of shrine.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Miroku…</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Yes, perhaps the Buddha incarnate, Hakushin, was the one who put up this barrier.</p>
<p class="txt">SHN:&emsp; Barrier? What are you saying?! Hakushin saved many people! How could he put up a barrier?</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; The strange light that you and your father saw was a demon called Naraku.</p>
<p class="txt">SHN:&emsp; Naraku?</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; (looking at the staff) Your father fought to protect Hakushin from Naraku.</p>
<p><span class="txtb">CUT TO FLASHBACK. </span>Nighttime. Demons rush out of the shrine. SHN's father fights some of them off with his staff while running toward the shrine. Cut to inside of shrine. A demon is trying to enter the barrier around the altar which contains the mummified body of Hakushin. SHN's father throws the staff and pins the demon to the side of the altar. The demon disintegrates. More demons rush out towards him. SHN's father, without his staff, can only look on helplessly.</p>
<p class="txt">Father:	Saint Hakushin!</p>
<p><span class="txtb">END OF FLASHBACK.</span> SHN takes the staff at the altar.</p>
<p class="txt">SHN:&emsp; So, the pile of bones that I saw was really my Father…</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Naraku was probably using Hakushin's power. Your father tried to prevent that.</p>
<p class="txt">SHN:&emsp; (looks down forlornly) That's what it takes to be the village leader… My Father wasn't cursed. (turns to MIR) That's true, isn't it?</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; (smiles) Sure!</p>
<p>SHN is glad.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Then, I wonder where Saint Hakushin is? Who was the one who put up the barrier?</p>
<br>
<p>Cut to INU and BKS fighting.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Damn it…!</p>
<p class="txt">BKS:&emsp;&nbsp; One more shot! I'll put an end to this!</p>
<p>BKS leaps to attack INU. SAN throws HIR, blocking BKS. They continue fighting. MIR and KAG run out of the shrine.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Inuyasha, hold out just a bit longer!</p>
<p>MIR stops in the middle of the island and thrusts his scepter on the ground. He takes out a few charms.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Since I know where the source of the barrier is… (looks at SHI in his arms) Shippo, I'll borrow your power.</p>
<p>SHI is still semi-conscious and weak. MIR rubs the charms on his forehead and flings the charms into the air.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; (thinking) I had transferred Shippo's demonic aura into the talisman. It should work!</p>
<p>One of the charms fall towards an area up ahead. A pink barrier appears and the charm disintegrates.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; (gasps) They've been purified. It's over there!</p>
<p>MIR puts SHI on the ground, grabs his scepter and runs to the small pink barrier. MIR strikes his scepter onto the barrier. Static surges. MIR gasps as a club-like thing is seen inside the barrier. KAG and SHN run to MIR.</p>
<p class="txt">SHN:&emsp; That is an altar equipment used by Saint Hakushin.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; This is…!</p>
<p>The barrier pushes MIR back.</p>
<p class="txt">SHN:&emsp; (holds up the staff) Try to use it to attack them!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Miroku!</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; (smiles) Let's try it.</p>
<p>SHN looks glad. Cut to MIR and SHN looking at the barrier. MIR raises his scepter high up. KAG look on worriedly.</p>
<p class="txt">SHN:&emsp; Please bless us, Father…</p>
<p>SHN raises his staff high up too. MIR and SHN then strike the barrier at the same time. Static surges and a heavy wind blows. The barrier finally shatters and the flowers on the island fade away.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;The flowers disappeared…!</p>
<p>Cut to INU and BKS facing off each other. TET throbs and a wind vortex appears around the blade.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (thinking) Wind Scar has returned… The barrier has been broken!</p>
<p>Cut to MIR, SHN and KAG examining the iron club on the ground.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; So, he is the one who put up the barrier…</p>
<p class="txt">SHN:&emsp; It's the iron club in the shrine!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(thinking) So, Hakushin is helping Naraku?</p>
<p>Cut to BKS and INU.</p>
<p class="txt">BKS:&emsp;&nbsp; (scoffs) Do you think you've been saved? Sorry, my condition is getting better. Thanks for breaking the barrier. Finally, that barrier has disappeared. (swings Banryuu) It's time for a fight, Inuyasha!</p>
<p>INU looks at BKS worriedly in silence.</p>
