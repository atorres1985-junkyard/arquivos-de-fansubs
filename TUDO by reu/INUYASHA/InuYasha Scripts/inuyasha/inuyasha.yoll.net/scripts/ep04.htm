Inuyasha can't see the manipulating hair strands of Yura at all! And Yura chases us like preys! To save Kaede who is buried, we have to finish her off fast! But how can we defeat her? Can Inuyasha defeat Yura, who claims to be immortal? I believe… I belive Yura has a weak spot! Next episode, 'Yura of the Demon-Hair'!</p>
<p class="header"><a name="1"></a>'Adult Swim' Synopsis</p>
<p>Inuyasha jumps into the Bone Eaters Well and convinces a reluctant Kagome to return to feudal Japan and help him find and cut the strand of Yura’s hair that controls all the other hairs. Shooting an arrow of purity, Kagome reveals the source of Yura’s power: a haunting comb used to untangle the hair of the dead before burial.</p>

<p class="txtb">[ recap ]</p>
<p>Recap of previous episode when KAG first encountered Yura and was pushed down the well. Cut to INU burying KAE under a mound of soil.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; I meant for you to hide here. If I don’t forget, I’ll come back and dig you out. (grabs a pile of leaves and spread it on top of the soil)</p>
<p class="txt">KAE:&emsp;&ensp;(worried and skeptical) Are you sure? You must not forget.</p><br>
<p class="txtb">[ Title screen: Yura of the Demon-Hair ]</p><br>
<p>Nighttime in the Higurashi residence. GRA, SOT and MOM gathers around the living room table with Buyo.</p>
<p class="txt">Mama: Grandpa, is Kagome’s story true?</p>
<p>GRA grunts and folds his arm.</p>
<p class="txt">Sota:&emsp;’Course it’s true! A ghost appeared from inside the well and kidnapped Kagome!</p>
<p>Cut-scene of episode 1, when the Centipede Monster grabbed KAG into the Dry Well.</p>
<p class="txt">GRA:&emsp; (narrating) As the legend of our shrine goes… There is something in the “bone-devouring well” that takes the corpses of evil spirits and makes them disappear somewhere.</p>
<p>Cut to the living room. GRA stands up and clenches his fist in a determined manner.</p>
<p class="txt">GRA:&emsp; (thinking) And if this “somewhere” is in the time dimension… Well, we must do something.</p>
<p>Buyo yawns while SOT and MOM look at GRA, puzzled.</p>
<p>Cut to interior of the structure which houses the Dry Well. GRA just finished nailing several planks on mouth of the well. He attaches a lot of paper oracles/charms all over the well.</p>
<p class="txt">GRA:&emsp; There! (laughs smugly to himself)</p><br>
<p>Cut to living room, KAG’s drying her hair with a blower.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(to GRA who’s drinking tea calmly) Huh? Sealed?</p>
<p class="txt">GRA:&emsp; Yes… With written oracles to ward off evil spirits and seal off the entry to the netherworld. The well will never be opened again.</p>
<p>GRA picks up his tea cup. KAG pauses for a while, looking concerned.</p><br>
<p>Cut to Feudal Era. INU is sprinting across a dark forest. He stops near the well and sniffs the ground.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; No mistaking the smell of that girl… (noticing the pile of KAG’s school uniform next to the well) Her clothing… Damn! She really did go home… (jumps into the well) In here!</p><br>
<p>Nighttime still, in KAG’s room.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(lying on her bed, thinking) Hmmm… Home sweet home! It’s like it never happened… that I was in another age and another time.</p>
<p><span class="txtb">CUT TO FLASHBACK</span> from episode 2, when KAG’s arrow destroyed the Corpse Crow and shattered the Sacred Jewel.</p>
<p class="txt">KAE:&emsp;&ensp;(voice-over) You must combine your powers with Inuyasha and gather the fragments of the Sacred Jewel and restore it!</p>
<p>Cut to previous episode when Yura snatched the Sacred Jewel fragment from KAG.</p>
<p class="txt">Yura:&emsp;Oh dear… The Sacred Jewel is in pieces.</p>
<p class="txtb">FADE TO PRESENT.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;That Yura with the inverted hair… I wonder what she was? She must’ve been after the Jewel, too. (sits up, looking guilty) I’ll bet Inuyasha would be so angry if he learned that the fragment was stolen from me.</p>
<p><span class="txtb">CUT TO FLASHBACK</span> from  previous episode, when INU quarreled with KAG.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Who cares about you!? I prefer to go it alone!</p>
<p class="txtb">CUT TO PRESENT.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(scoffs) Yes… Inuyasha can manage without me. (claps, determined) All right, I’ll forget him! Besides, I can never return to that world again.</p>
<p class="txt">Mama: (background) Kagome, Yuka is on the phone. And it’s also dinnertime!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(cheerful) Okay! (gets out of bed)</p><br>
<p>At the dinner table, a hotpot is simmering. SOT and GRA are talking.</p>
<p class="txt">Sota:&emsp;Gramps… Will the seals on the well ever come off?</p>
<p class="txt">GRA:&emsp; Never. Each seal contains powerful words of magic that can’t be broken. No matter what kind of evil spirit, it will be impossible.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(kneels down at the table, happily) It’s hot pot for dinner!</p>
<p class="txt">GRA:&emsp; So you can rest assured, Kagome.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Hot pot! Hot pot! Hot pot! (ranting happily, oblivious to GRA’s words)</p>
<p class="txt">Sota:&emsp;She’s not listening.</p>
<p>Mock tears flow out of GRA’s eyes.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(gives a blissful sigh, thinking) It’s such a glorious age!</p>
<p>Cut to close-up of INU’s feet stomping rapidly. Cut to KAG grabbing a pair of chopsticks</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Let’s dig in!</p>
<p>The door behind KAG slams open suddenly. It’s INU. The family stares at INU, shocked.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Huh… Inuyasha?</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (pissed) You…! Who said you can go home?!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(puts down her bowl) You… Where’d you come from?</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (storms next to KAG) The well! Where else?</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;The well? But it’s…!</p>
<p class="txt">GRA:&emsp; (interrupting, firm tone) Do not lie! Those oracles have been used of this shrine since ancient times and cannot fail!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (holds up a piece of charm) Oracle? You mean, this flimsy piece of paper? Didn’t work!</p>
<p>GRA clasps his face with his hands in horror, mock tears flowing out of his eyes.</p>
<p class="txt">Sota:&emsp;(chiding) Gramps!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (grabs KAG’s arm and tries to leave the room) Now come with me!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Wa--wait! I don’t want to go!</p>
<p class="txt">Mama: (firm) Just a minute! (walks up to INU and KAG)</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; What?!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Mom… (glad that her mom is trying to stop INU)</p>
<p class="txt">Mama: (touches and feels INU’s ears) Your ears… Are they real?</p>
<p class="txt">Sota:&emsp;(walks up to INU) Lemme try, too!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Mom, this is no time for that… Although I did the same thing. (notices a glistening strand of hair on INU’s sleeves) Inuyasha… A strand of hair!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Hair? (looks at where KAG is looking)</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Can’t you see it?</p>
<p>KAG picks up the hair, which coils around KAG’s hand by itself. It tightens and makes a small slit on her hand, and blood oozes out. </p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Huh?! It’s moving!</p>
<p class="txt">GRA:&emsp; Kagome… There’s blood…!</p>
<p class="txt">Mama: What happened?</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(holding up the hair) This…!</p>
<p>Everyone is taken aback, but doesn't see anything in KAG's hands.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(thinking) Only I can see it…!</p>
<p><span class="txtb">CUT TO FLASHBACK </span>from  previous episode when Yura snatched the Sacred Jewel fragment from KAG.</p>
<p class="txt">Yura:&emsp;But being able to “see” isn’t enough.</p>
<p class="txtb">BACK TO PRESENT .</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(gasps in horror, thinking) Yura’s manipulating strand! No! (runs off)</p><br>
<p>KAG slides open the door of the hut that houses the Dry Well. The planks sealing the well are all shattered and scattered onto the ground. Thick bundles of hair snakes out of the well rapidly.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;More strands… are coming out!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (leaning by the door, calmly) Old Kaede was right. You have the vision at least.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;You brought something awful with you!!</p>
<p class="txt">GRA:&emsp; (reaching the hut with the rest of the family) Kagome!</p>
<p class="txt">Sota:&emsp;Sis!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Don’t enter! (slams the doors close, thinking) Here… I must stop it right here! (determined)</p>
<p>INU looks at KAG intently. The bundles of hair rushes towards them. KAG dodges. The hair hits the door and deflect towards INU.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Inuyasha! In front of you!</p>
<p>INU’s ears twitches, hearing the movement of the hair. He dodges but subsequent bundles of hair coil around his wrists and ankles. INU pulls at them. Cut to exterior of the hut.</p>
<p class="txt">GRA:&emsp; (banging on the door) Open up, Kagome!</p>
<p class="txt">Mama: Kagome!</p>
<p>Cut to interior of the hut. INU claws at the bundles of hair, which breaks and falls to the ground. They slither towards each other and join up.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;It gathers together again, even when it’s cut. There’s no end to this!</p>
<p>The bundles of hair coil to form one thick pile which grabs INU’s wrist.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp; Huh?! That’s…? (notices a strand of hair coming out from the well) That’s it! The main strand that’s controlling everything. (runs down the stairs towards the well) Inuyasha! It’s this one! Cut this strand!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (struggles with the hair griping him and looks in KAG’s direction) This? Where?</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Inuyasha can’t see it. (determined) Then… (pulls at the tight controlling hair) There’s only one way! (bends it a little to reflect some light on it)</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; I see it!</p>
<p>INU claws and snaps the controlling hair. The bundles of hair gripping him slackens and falls to the ground, slithering back into the well.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; It retreated.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(thinking, rubbing her hand which was bruised by pulling at the taut controlling hair) Strange… If Yura was after the Sacred Jewel, she already accomplished her goal. Could she actually be after me and Inuyasha? (walks to the well, to INU) Inuyasha, let’s return!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Wow… That was a quick change of mind.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;I don’t really want to go.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Huh?</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(thinking) But if I stay here, Gramps, Mom and even Sota will be in terrible danger. Huh?</p>
<p>INU takes off his red coat and plops in over KAG’s head.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (looking away from KAG) This was woven with the fur of the Fire Rat. It’s much stronger than an ordinary armor.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Th-thank you.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (childishly) Well, ‘cuz… You look like you have really weird skin.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;You’re the weird one!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Oh well, whatever. Let’s go! (jumps onto the mouth of the well)</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(climbs up the well) Uh-huh! (determined)</p>
<p>INU holds onto KAG and they jump into the well. INU makes a ‘Keh’ sound.</p><br>
<p>Cut to Yura in her lair, lying on a floor of skulls.</p>
<p class="txt">Yura:&emsp;They should be returning soon. (picks up a red skull next to her) This time, I’ll give them a big reception… (strokes the red skull affectionately)</p><br>
<p>Nighttime in a dark forest, where INU buried KAE. She is talking loudly to the air, only her head is seen.</p>
<p class="txt">KAE:&emsp;&ensp;Do you understand, Inuyasha? Kagome is my sister Kikyo’s reincarnation. However, she isn’t aware yet of the scope of her powers. She needs your help right now!</p><br>
<p>At the Dry Well in the Feudal Era.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Watch out! There’s hair all over the well, too!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (climbing out of the well) Are you saying that this Yura with the combed Hair is after us?</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(following) Yes. Look, she took the Sacred Jewel fragment, yet she still comes after us!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Hold it! Did you say she took it?!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(ignoring and looks into the forest) I can see several glowing strands of hair there. There’s the main strand that’s been bewitching the others. That means if we follow the main strand, we’ll find Yura! (points in a direction) That way!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Alright!</p><br>
<p>Back with KAE.</p>
<p class="txt">KAE:&emsp;&ensp;There’s no time to stand around and quarrel! You need Kagome and Kagome needs you! And you must get through this difficulty together!</p><br>
<p>INU leaps across a pond, piggybacking KAG. They run through a forest, and reach an campfire site. Corpses of warriors struck down with arrows surround a campfire.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; A bonfire…</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Their heads are gone!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (lets KAG off his back and examines the corpses) They’re fallen warriors. They must’ve gotten tangled in the hair strands. Such bad luck. (turns around to look at KAG) Stop looking so depressed! And don’t start whining about wanting to go home.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(picking up a bow and a quiver of arrows) I…thought I’d borrow this! (thinking) We must destroy Yura quickly or many innocent people will die.</p>
<p>INU looks at KAG intently. They resume their journey. INU hops up a cliff surface, piggybacking KAG.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; The arrows you shoot probably won’t hit their targets.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;How rude! If I practice, maybe…!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (leaps onto a tree trunk) Practice? Did you practice?</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;From now on! Just watch me! I’m going to improve! (determined, clenches  fist)</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (thinking) Huh?! This girl… She’s hopeless, but I gotta admit, she’s gutsy.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;The main lines are gathering. She’s close!</p>
<p>Many strands of taut hair surround the trees in the forest. They tighten suddenly, slicing off the trunk that they were standing on. They leap off. Bundles of hair surge towards them.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;They’re coming!</p>
<p>INU leaps into the air.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;From the left! The right, too!</p>
<p>INU somersaults. More bundles of hair appear.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Too many! Use your instincts to evade them!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Whhaa--?! What a useless woman! I thought you came to fight?!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;There! Before you!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (leaps onto a rock) The rear, too?! (leaps to another rock)</p>
<p>INU slides down a slope while piggybacking KAG. A bundle of hair suddenly coil around INU’s wrist and pulls him into the air. KAG’s falls off and lands face down on the slope.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(getting up) Inuyasha!</p>
<p>INU is hoisted in the air among a web of hair which surrounds a giant sphere of hair.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;A giant sphere of hair… Yura’s hiding place?</p>
<p>Yura suddenly appears, leaping, against the night sky. She lands on a few strands of hair which is similar to a tightrope. Strands of hair are coiled around her fingers.</p>
<p class="txt">Yura:&emsp;Hmm… such a fine prey.</p>
<p>INU tries to free himself, but can’t.</p>
<p class="txt">Yura:&emsp;You’re Inuyasha, aren’t you?</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; So you’re Yura? How do you know me?</p>
<p class="txt">Yura:&emsp;I heard the gossip in the wind. That a half-demon named Inuyasha is serving the reincarnation of a shrine maiden and helping her to protect for the Sacred Jewel.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; What?! Me? Serving that brainless girl…? You’ve gotta be kidding me!</p>
<p class="txt">Yura:&emsp;I see… Well, both of you are brainless. (takes out the Sacred Jewel fragment from a pouch) Turning the Sacred Jewel into this.</p>
<p>INU growls furiously at Yura. </p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;That’s the Jewel fragment she stole from me!</p>
<p class="txt">Yura:&emsp;In any case, I’ll deal with you two and go look for the other fragments.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (scoffs) Deal with me? You’re the one who’ll rue the day you appeared before my eyes!</p>
<p>INU pulls and breaks free from the hair around his ankles and left wrist. He then uses the bundle of hair around his right wrist to swing towards Yura. Yura pulls out a red comb and combs a thick bundle of hair at INU.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; The same tactic over and over again!</p>
<p>The thick hair envelopes him and ties him down in the air again.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Damn it!</p>
<p class="txt">Yura:&emsp;(appears behind INU) Such pretty hair… But you haven’t taken care of it, have you? So many split ends.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Shut up!</p>
<p>INU swings around to claw at Yura, but she falls backwards in anticipation and somersaults gracefully onto another ‘tightrope-hair’ further away. The tightrope sinks lower under her weight, then spring her back into the air, towards INU. Yura, in mid flight, takes out a sword and cuts him. INU winces in pain.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Inuyasha…!!</p>
<p>Yura lands on another tightrope in front of INU. She giggles and licks the blood off her blade.<br> </p>
<p class="txt">Yura:&emsp;Now, I’ll shred you to pieces!</p>
<p>Yura brandishes her sword and leaps towards INU. Mid-flight, something flies past her, which takes her aback. She lands on one tightrope to find out what happened. She sees KAG with a bow in her hand, in firing position, on the ground below.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Release Inuyasha! Because I won’t miss this time! (readies another arrow)</p>
<p class="txt">Yura:&emsp;The woman who disappeared from the well…?</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Now! Hurry it up!</p>
<p class="txt">Yura:&emsp;Release Inuyasha, you say? You two must be quite chummy!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (turns to KAG) Fool! Forget me and get away!</p>
<p class="txt">Yura:&emsp;It’s not that pretty, but I think I’ll take her hair, too. What’ll I do?</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(mad) “Not that pretty”? I condition my hair everyday! Stop being so rude! (fires an arrow, which flies towards INU’s back)</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (bow his head and dodge the arrow, yelling) Where are you aiming, stupid?!</p>
<p>The arrow hits the huge sphere of hair (Yura’s lair) Light emits from the arrow. The sphere of hair unravels, skulls falling out of it. The sphere is made up of the hair still attached to the skulls. KAG gasps in horror.</p>
<p class="txt">Yura:&emsp;No! All my victims…!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; The heads of those fallen warriors we saw…</p>
<p class="txt">Yura:&emsp;Your head will soon occupy a place there. All this fine silver-colored hair…I can’t wait to control it. (holding her red comb) Before that, however… You there! Woman! (combs out a ball of fire) You scare me, so die!</p>
<p>The fire surge towards KAG and engulf her. KAG falls to the ground, cowering.</p>
<p class="txt"> Yura:&emsp;How do you like my Elf Fire! You’ll feel the heat all the way to your bones!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(struggling) He--help!</p>
<p class="txt">Yura:&emsp;Serves you right! You’re being punished for messing with my nest! Aghh… That woman…she’ll be left with no bones.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Why you…!</p>
<p class="txt">Yura:&emsp;Are you sad? Poor thing… Well, you’ll be joining her in no time, too. (unsheathes her sword and leap towards INU) Take this!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (digs his claws into his wound and swings his bloodied claws at Yura) Blades of Blood!</p>
<p>Four red blades fly towards Yura and slices off her hand which was holding the sword.</p>
<p class="txt">Yura:&emsp;(thinking, taken by surprise) Blades of blood?<br> </p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; The strands are loosening!</p>
<p>Yura’s hand falls downwards but is caught by a few strands of hair.</p>
<p class="txt">Yura:&emsp;My hand…</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Now you can’t control your strands!</p>
<p class="txt">Yura:&emsp;You… You should treat ladies more gently. People will laugh at you, you know?</p>
<p>The skulls from her lair starts to chuckle. The sphere of hair slackens even more and more skulls droop towards the ground.</p>
<p class="txt">Yura:&emsp;Playtime’s over!</p>
<p>Yura holds her red comb in her mouth and pulls at the hair around her remaining hand. A bundle of skull with hair flies towards INU, who crushes them with his fist. The hand holding the sword, which was sliced off, flies towards INU too. INU dodges in time.</p>
<p class="txt">Yura:&emsp;(calmly) Darn! I almost had your head!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; I wouldn’t allow that!</p>
<p>INU release another attack of Blades of Blood at Yura. Yura calmly swings her comb, and a curtain of hair falls in front of her, blocking INU’s attack. Yura’s sliced off hand charges towards INU from behind, and cuts into his back. INU lets out a cry. The hair gripping onto INU slackens, making INU crash on the ground. Yura’s sliced off hand pulls out the sword and flies back to her wrist. A bundle of hair envelopes her wrist, and her hand is reattached to it.</p>
<p class="txt">Yura:&emsp;(flexing her hand, while holding her sword with the other) You’re just a half-demon with half the power.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Damn…!</p>
<p class="txt">Yura:&emsp;Poor little thing… You wanted this in order to become a full-fledged demon, huh?</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; The Sacred… Jewel…</p>
<p class="txt">Yura:&emsp;(lands in front of INU on the ground) Don’t move. I have to sever your head very carefully so that blood won’t stain those silver locks. (swings her sword at INU)</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Quit your joking! (shots up and dives his claws into Yura’s chest, making a hole through her body) Hah! That’ll teach you! (falls to the ground again)</p>
<p class="txt">Yura:&emsp;(steps on INU’s hand  calmly) You’re so arrogant. Thrusting your hand into the breasts of a woman you’ve only just met.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (thinking) You… you…! You didn’t feel anything?!</p>
<p class="txt">Yura:&emsp;You stole my Jewel fragment, didn’t you? (bends over and takes back the pouch from INU) Now that wasn’t nice at all.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (thinking) Where is it?! Where is Yura’s weak spot?</p>
<p>Yura stands up and laugh. Suddenly, the hair on her red comb (in her hand) tightens. She turns around, only to find KAG climbing towards Yura’s giant lair.</p>
<p class="txt">Yura:&emsp;(mad) That woman…</p>
<p>Yura pulls some hair around her fingers, which tugs at the main sphere, causing KAG to slip and fall. KAG manages to cling onto some hair which prevented her from falling further. INU grabbed the chance and pick up Yura’s sword.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (swings the sword upwards) You shouldn’t have looked away!</p>
<p>INU slices Yura’s back, which were immediately mended by hair.</p>
<p class="txt">Yura:&emsp;(turns around and glare at INU) You are becoming a pain!</p>
<p>Yura swings her hand which tug at the hair gripping onto INU, making him crash onto a rock surface.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (laughs) You didn’t bat an eyelid when you were struck or hurt. Now, you seem awfully upset. Something worrying you over there?</p>
<p>Yuna gives an incredibly pissed-off look.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Inuyasha! There’s something inside that…that red skull! (pointing)</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Red Skull?!</p>
<p>Yuna turns around and leaps off towards KAG, taking her sword.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; You’re not getting away! (breaks away from the grip of the hair)</p>
<p class="txt">Yura:&emsp;My web of hair! (pulls up the entire sphere of hair, dragging KAG along with it)</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (follows but is blocked by two bundles of hair) Damn!</p>
<p>KAG tries to get a better grip of the moving pile of hair, but reaches a skull instead. She squirms.</p>
<p class="txt">Yura:&emsp;If it hurts you, let go. (flings her swords at KAG, which hits the INU’s coat that she’s wearing) I did it!</p>
<p>KAG falls off and in gripped in midair by two bundles of air around her wrists.</p>
<p class="txt">Yura:&emsp;What are you? Why don’t you bleed?</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(thinking) Now that she mentions it… Even when engulfed in flames… Is it because of this robe?</p>
<p><span class="txtb">CUT TO FLASHBACK </span>from earlier in the episode when INU plopped his coat over KAG’s head.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; It’s an armor made from the fur of the Fire Rat. It’s much stronger than ordinary metal.</p>
<p class="txtb">BACK TO PRESENT .</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Inuyasha…</p>
<p class="txt">Yura:&emsp;(appears right in front of KAG) You seem like an ordinary mortal… How’s this then? (coils a strand of hair around KAG’s neck, making KAG wince in pain)</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Blades of Blood!</p>
<p>An array of red blades slash Yura’s back and cut the hair around her fingers.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(the strand of hair around her neck slackens) I--Inuyasha… (weakly)</p>
<p>The sphere of hair starts to collapse, bringing KAG with it.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Don’t you faint on me! I can’t be looking after you!</p>
<p>INU leaps towards KAG and lifts her. They land on the ground safely, the sphere of hair collapsing onto the ground behind.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Watch out, Inuyasha!</p>
<p>INU turns around to look and is struck by Yuna’s sword.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Why that…!</p>
<p class="txt">Yura:&emsp;(lands on a mountain of skulls and takes back the sword with a hair) I am immortal, you know!</p>
<p>Yuna sends the sword towards INU again. She is struck by a sudden pain. KAG is driving an arrow into the red skull on the ground, trying to crack it.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;That’s it! The strand coming out of this red skull… It’s connected to Yura’s hand!</p>
<p class="txt">Yura:&emsp;That woman… I’ll kill her!</p>
<p>Yuna sends the sword towards KAG instead. Just as the sword is about to reach KAG’s head, KAG succeeds in cracking the red skull. The sword stops in mid air. Light emits from the skull. A red hemisphere within the skull breaks into two. Yuna gasps in terror and disintegrates. Her clothes fall downwards to the ground. The sword also falls unto the ground. KAG catches her breath. She picks up one of the broken hemisphere, which turns out to be a red comb.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (walks towards KAG, clenching onto his wound) So that’s Yura’s true form…</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;This red comb?</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; That’s the Adornment Comb of the Dead. It was used to comb the hair of the dead…that’s how it probably got bewitched. In this day and age, an enchanted comb or two is nothing to be surprised at. (lets out a cry and kneels down)</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Inuyasha…you’re badly hurt. Because you let me wear your Fire Rat armor.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; It’s nothing. But the Sacred Jewel…!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(notices the pouch near Yuna’s clothes and picks it up) I found it. (opens the pouch and takes out the Sacred Jewel fragment) I wonder how long it’ll take to accumulate them all?</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Let’s go, Kagome. (takes his coat and stands up)</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Huh?</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; What?</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;It’s the first time you said my name.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; So what?</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Maybe you’ve decided to be a bit nicer to me?</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Keh! Don’t get cheeky! Who’d be chums with a girl like you?!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;What?! And who was it that just saved you?</p>
<p>KAG slaps INU’s back teasingly. INU winces in pain and falls over.</p>
<p class="txt"> KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Look…if it hurts, just speak up and say so!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Shut up!</p><br>

<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;I was able to escape unscathed this time round due to the Fire Rat Robe that Inuyasha lent me. It reminds me of 'The Bamboo Cutter's Tale' when Princess Kaguya asked her suitor for a Fire Rat Robe. It actually exists in the demon world! Next, the demonic sword, Tetsusaiga makes its appearance! The two brothers would engage in a death match for this sword! Next episode, '<a href="ep05.htm">Aristocratic Assassin, Sesshomaru</a>'!</p><br></td></tr>
