But when the rogue demon chases them out of the ruins of Naraku’s castle they run into Inuyasha and his friends, putting Ayame face-to-face with the other girl to whom Koga has vowed marriage – Kagome.</p>

   <li><i>Lunar Rainbow<br>    </i>The moon rainbow that Ayame mentions really exists. The moonbow, or night-time rainbow, can be seen on strongly-lit nights. However, as human visual perception for color in low light is poor, they are seen as white. <span class="contri">{Wikipedia}</span><br> Here are the specific conditions needed to see a moonbow:<br> - A bright moon near to full<br> - Raining opposite the moon<br> - Sky must be dark<br> - Moon must be less than 42º high. <span class="contri">{Moonbow}</span></li>

<p>Evening. An elderly white wolf with bushy eyebrows sit at the edge of a cliff, overlooking a desolate landscape. A tornado appears behind him. It dissipates to reveal a young woman with two pony-tails and a hibiscus-like flower in her hair. She kneels. A line of white wolves sit obediently behind her. A short pause. The elderly demon nods. The young woman and the wolves leap off immediately.</p><br>
<p>Nighttime, by a peaceful river. The fireflies are out. Suddenly KOG sprints across the shallow river and several wolves chase him. They attack him and KOG punches them away. KOG spins and leaps onto a tall tree.</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; Stop chasing me, otherwise I won't let you off!</p>
<p class="txt">Female Voice: Why are you so impatient?</p>
<p>The young woman from earlier on appears. The flower in her hair glitters. She laughs.</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; Who the hell are you? Making the wolves to attack me? Do you have any grudge against me?</p>
<p>GIN and HAK come running into the scene, panting.</p>
<p class="txt">HAK:&emsp; Isn't that the elder's granddaughter, Ayame?</p>
<p class="txt">GIN:&emsp;&ensp;I heard she went to the North mountain with elder long ago.</p>
<p class="txt">HAK:&emsp; She's back?</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; (surprised) Ayame?</p>
<p class="ttable">* The young woman, Ayame, abbreviated as AYA from now onwards *</p>
<p class="txt">AYA:&emsp;&nbsp; I'm here to convey a message from my grandfather.</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; Message?</p>
<p class="txt">AYA:&emsp;&nbsp; You'll marry me. That's your promise.</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; (horrified) M-Marry you?</p>
<p>GIN &amp; HAK gapes at AYA.</p>
<p class="txt">AYA:&emsp;&nbsp; You can be our elder, since you've gotten the Sacred Jewel fragments. So, you should marry me!</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; S-Stop joking! Why must I marry you?</p>
<p class="txt">AYA:&emsp;&nbsp; (frowns) You don't remember?</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; What?</p>
<p class="txt">AYA:&emsp;&nbsp; You promised to marry me when I come back from the mountain!</p>
<p>KOG's knees buckle. GIN and HAK gasp and turn to KOG.</p>
<p class="txt">HAK:&emsp; Did you say that, Koga?</p>
<p class="txt">GIN:&emsp;&ensp;What about sister Kagome?</p>
<p>AYA leaps up and stands next to KOG on the tree branch. She grabs KOG's arm.</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; (struggling) W-What are you doing?</p>
<p class="txt">AYA:&emsp;&nbsp; (forceful) Grandfather asked me to take you home no matter what!</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; (wobbling) Stupid, we're going to fall!</p>
<p>The branch they are on breaks and they fall to into the water, shrieking.</p>
<p class="txt">GIN:&emsp;&ensp;Oi, are you alright?</p>
<p>AYA and KOG pops out of the water surface. Cut to KOG struggling to shallow water. AYA is stilling grabbing on his arm.</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; Let go of your hand!</p>
<p>AYA's wolves go behind KOG and bite onto his calves.</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; You guys!</p>
<p class="txt">AYA:&emsp;&nbsp; You guys, don't let go!</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; By the way, I have Kagome as my fiancée already! How could I have any promise with you?!</p>
<p>KOG turns into a tornado and spins away.</p>
<p class="txt">AYA:&emsp;&nbsp; (wobbly) Fiancée… Kagome?</p>
<p class="txt">GIN:&emsp;&ensp;(yells) Oi! Wait up, Koga!</p>
<p>GIN &amp; HAK run after KOG.</p>
<p class="txt">AYA:&emsp;&nbsp; (frowns) Does he really not remember?</p>
<p>The wolves howl. AYA chagrins to them and looks to the full moon.</p>
<p class="txt">AYA:&emsp;&nbsp; But he promised… On the day of the full moon with a rainbow.</p>

<p>Daytime on a cliff. INU-gang sits around, having a conversation.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; So we still can't find Naraku?</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;We've tried very hard to find him, but…</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; The name Naraku isn't known anywhere.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; I see… (looks at INU who is sulking) Inuyasha can't smell Naraku's scent either.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (folds his arms) How could such a strong bad aura disappear so easily?</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; (takes a sip of water) There's nothing we can do either.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Kagome, can you sense the Sacred Jewel fragments?</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Sorry, I can't sense them at all.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Well, there's no point to worry about that now. Once we collected the Sacred Jewel fragments, Naraku will surely come to us.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; What a joke! Do you think it's going to be that easy?</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Do you have a better idea?</p>
<p>INU scoffs.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;But, besides what Naraku has, I wonder how many Sacred Jewel fragments are left uncollected?</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(reaches into her pocket and takes out a container) Well… I've only three pieces right now. (thinking) There is one in Kohaku's back. Two with Koga.</p><br>
<p>AYA and her wolves sit on the rocks on a riverbank. AYA is kicking water forlornly. She stops and lets out a long sigh. A wolf walks up and nuzzle her.</p>
<p class="txt">AYA:&emsp;&nbsp; It was long before, but he did promise me.</p>
<p>Fade to flashback. It is drizzling in a forest. KOG carries a young AYA on her back, walking on. AYA looks sad and she holds a hibiscus-like flower in her hand.</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; Don't be too harsh on yourself. No matter how hard it is, (turns to look at AYA) I'll take you as my bride, Ayame. (grins)</p>
<p>AYA smiles. Fade to present.</p>
<p class="txt">AYA:&emsp;&nbsp; It was a promise when I was a child. If Koga doesn't remember, what can I do? Should I just return to the mountain?</p>
<p>Fade to flashback of the elderly wolf on the cliff.</p>
<p class="txt">Elder:&ensp; (to AYA) My territory was destroyed. Without the power of Sacred Jewel fragments, we can't fight them. Go find Koga… and bring him back as quickly as you can.</p>
<p>AYA nods. Fade to present.</p>
<p class="txt">AYA:&emsp;&nbsp; (shakes her head, resolute) No, I can't go back! (stands and clenches her fist) No matter what, I must try once again! (leaps off)</p><br>
<p>KOG-gang is in NAR's castle. The wolves are sniffing the ground.</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; Damn! What's going on? (thinking) I can smell Naraku's scent here. He can't deceive me.</p>
<p>KOG squats next to the long cracks in the ground left by INU's wind scar.</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; (grabs a fist of soil, thinking) These scars…</p>
<p class="txt">GIN:&emsp;&ensp;(runs out of the castle with HAK) Koga, the castle is empty.</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; Let's go.</p>
<p class="txt">GIN:&emsp;&ensp;Where to?</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; To find dog-face and make him speak. This castle has that dumb dog's scent too. They must have fought before.</p>
<p class="txt">HAK:&emsp; Oh yeah, Inuyasha might know something.</p>
<p>KOG turns into a tornado and spins away.</p>
<p class="txt">HAK:&emsp; Hey, wait!</p>
<p class="txt">GIN:&emsp;&ensp;Don't leave us!</p>
<p>GIN, HAK and the wolves run after KOG.</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; (thinking) Naraku isn't here. If he's nearby, he'll surely attack me for my Sacred Jewel fragments!</p><br>
<p>Cut to the basement in NAR's castle. Some fleshy bits move towards each other. Bundles of hair are moving too.</p><br>
<p>A while later, AYA and the wolves arrive at NAR's castle. The wolves sniff the ground. AYA, on a watchtower, whistles and the wolves gather and howl.</p>
<p class="txt">AYA:&emsp;&nbsp; (nods) No mistake. Koga was here. But… (looks around) Where is this? It's creepy.</p>
<p>The ground shakes.</p>
<p class="txt">AYA:&emsp;&nbsp; What?</p>
<p>The ground explodes and a huge hair ball with a giant lip bursts out of the ground. A few bundles of hair coil around some wolves and lift them in the air. The wolves whimper in pain. AYA rushes forward and throws a leaf, which spins and slices off the hair, releasing the wolves. The hair monster brandishes its sharp teeth. AYA punches the ground and a lot of leaves burst out of the ground. They fly around the hair monster. When they settle, AYA and the wolves are gone.</p>
<p class="ttable">* The hair monster abbreviated as HMO from now onwards. *</p><br>
<p>Cut to AYA and the wolves sprinting in a forest. HMA is hot on their heels/</p>
<p class="txt">AYA:&emsp;&nbsp; What monster is that? (sees GIN and HAK running in front of her) Ginta, Hakkaku!</p>
<p class="txt">HAK:&emsp; It's Ayame!</p>
<p class="txt">GIN:&emsp;&ensp;(panics) Why is she here?</p>
<p class="txt">HAK:&emsp; (sweats) Who knows?!</p>
<p class="txt">AYA:&emsp;&nbsp; (leaps in front of the two and blocks their way) You guys, what were you doing at that creepy castle? Where's Koga? What monster is that?</p>
<p class="txt">GIN:&emsp;&ensp;Monster?</p>
<p>HMO pops out of the trees. AYA, GIN and HAK gasp in terror. AYA throws a leaf and slashes off a bundle of HMO's hair. It slithers off.</p>
<p class="txt">GIN:&emsp;&ensp;Did that monster come out from Naraku's castle?</p>
<p class="txt">AYA:&emsp;&nbsp; Naraku's… castle?</p>
<p class="txt">HAK:&emsp; You were in the mountain with the leader, so you don't know. The Northern and the Eastern tribes were killed.</p>
<p class="txt">GIN:&emsp;&ensp;All these were done by the demon, Naraku.</p>
<p class="txt">HAK:&emsp; Koga was trying to take revenge on Naraku…</p>
<p class="txt">AYA:&emsp;&nbsp; I see…</p>
<p>HMO pops out of the trees again, laughing.</p>
<p class="txt">GIN:&emsp;&ensp;It's coming back!</p>
<p>AYA, HAK and GIN run off.</p><br>
<p>Back with INU-gang. KAG suddenly stops and turns around.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; What's wrong, Kagome?</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;The sense of Sacred Jewel fragments.</p>
<p>INU frowns and his ears twitches. A tornado twirls towards them.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;That tornado…</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (cracks his knuckles and scoffs) No wonder I smelled some nasty air.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(looks at INU) He's already mad…</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (sprints forward) That Koga! He's trying to get Kagome's attention again!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Inuyasha!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Ko… (KOH steps on his head and springs next to KAG) ga…!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Koga!</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; Yo, Kagome! (holds KAG's hands) How are you?</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(smiles uneasily) Well…</p>
<p>INU pops out between KOG and KAG, separating them, and glares at KOG.</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; Dog-face, what happened to Naraku? Tell me frankly.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; That's your deal, wild wolf?</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; What else is there?</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Then don't talk so friendly with Kagome!</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; Answer my question!</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; We are seeking for Naraku's whereabouts too.</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; I don't understand… Why did Naraku run away from his castle?</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (scoffs) You want to know, wild wolf? I had broken Naraku's barrier! (holds up TET, smug) With this Tetsusaiga! Ha! Aren't you shocked? Would you like to try it too?</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; (in awe) So that's what happened? Since you're so capable… (furious) How could Naraku escape?! Aren't you stupid?!</p>
<p>INU is speechless.</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; (slaps his forehead) What a shame! (shakes his head) If I were there, I could've finished him off!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (shaking in anger, with hand on TET) That bastard…!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(appeasing) Inuyasha, don't get angry…</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Speaking all he wishes… I'll kill him!</p>
<p>KOG suddenly looks shocked. The sky turns cloudy.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Bad aura…</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; It's Naraku!</p>
<p>Rumbling is heard in the forest near them. MIR, SAN and INU get ready to attack. HAK, GIN and the wolves run out of the forest.</p>
<p class="txt">HAK:&emsp; Koga!</p>
<p class="txt">GIN:&emsp;&ensp;In Naraku's castle…</p>
<p class="txt">HAK:&emsp; There's a monster!</p>
<p>KOG gasps. HMO bursts out of the forest, growling.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;It's huge!</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;W-What's that?</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Is it one of Naraku's clones?</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; A long hair monster!</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; That means Naraku is still in the castle?</p>
<p class="txt">GIN:&emsp;&ensp;No mistake. Ayame said she saw it.</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; Ayame? Was she with you? Where is she?</p>
<p class="txt">GIN:&emsp;&ensp;I don't know! We were dispersed while we were running!</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; What's going on? (looks to the sky, thinking) Why didn't I notice his scent?</p>
<p class="txt">HMO:&emsp; Sacred Jewel… fragments…</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Kagome, stay back! This fool wants the Sacred Jewel fragments!</p>
<p>KAG nods.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (leaps) You're disguised as a monster, but it seems you can speak! (grabs a bunch of HMO's hair, lands and pulls) You…!</p>
<p>INU pulls HMO by his hair and flings him over to the cliff edge.</p>
<p class="txt">HAK:&emsp; What an amazing power!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Answer! Where's Naraku?</p>
<p>A bunch of HMO's hair move towards KAG.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Kagome!</p>
<p>KOG grabs KAG and leaps off, dodging HMO's hair.</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; (in the air) Dog-face, deal with the monster! I'll take Kagome to a safe spot! (sprints down the cliff face)</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Oei! You… are so selfish!</p>
<p>HMO's hair in INU's hand suddenly breaks and HMO falls off the cliff. MIR, SAN, SHI and KIR run to INU.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Has it fallen down?</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Damn!</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Compared to Naraku's clones, he's weak.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; No, he fell on purpose. (worried) The guy is aiming for the Sacred Jewel fragments!</p><br>
<p>Cut to KOG and KAG in a forest.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Wait, Koga! Where are we going?</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; A place where… (leaps off a tree) the monster won't reach!</p>
<p>Suddenly leaves fly out and attack KOG. KOG dodge and lands on a rock.</p>
<p class="txt">AYA:&emsp;&nbsp; (lands on a rock) Koga!</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; Ayame?</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Ayame?</p>
<p class="txt">AYA:&emsp;&nbsp; That woman is human! What the hell are you doing?</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; (puts KAG down) I don't have time to explain to you. Kagome. Run!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Eh?</p>
<p class="txt">AYA:&emsp;&nbsp; (furious) Kagome? Kagome… is the fiancée you talked about?</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(confused) F-Fiancée? Whose?</p>
<p class="txt">AYA:&emsp;&nbsp; (waves her hands madly) Koga is mine!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(yells) Koga, why did you say that?!</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; Because I'm in love with you!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(furious) Don't decide on your own!</p>
<p class="txt">AYA:&emsp;&nbsp; Koga's fiancée is me! (leaps) I'm sorry, you better die!</p>
<p>AYA throws some leaves at KAG. KOG leaps and kicks them away furiously. The sharp leaves fall to the ground.</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; Your attack won't work against me. If you go any further, I won't let you off!</p>
<p class="txt">AYA:&emsp;&nbsp; You simply fell in love with a human! What happened to the Wolf Demon tribe's pride?</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; Shut up! I fell in love with Kagome. You have no right to judge me!</p>
<p class="txt">AYA:&emsp;&nbsp; KA-GO-ME!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(uneasy) What?</p>
<p class="txt">AYA:&emsp;&nbsp; I hate you!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Eh?</p>
<p class="txt">AYA:&emsp;&nbsp; Your name is similar to mine!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(thinking, grimaces) Oh please, it's just the last character.</p>
<p class="txt">AYA:&emsp;&nbsp; Even if you want to marry her, we can't break the rules of our tribe!</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; It's the elder's rule that they made on their own. When did I say I want to marry you?!</p>
<p>There is a short pause.</p>
<p class="txt">AYA:&emsp;&nbsp; (softly) Your promise…</p>
<p>KOG is taken aback.</p>
<p class="txt">AYA:&emsp;&nbsp; Full moon with a rainbow? Don't you remember?</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; The night of full moon… with a rainbow?</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(thinking) The moon usually comes out at night. But how would rainbow appears at night?</p>
<p class="txt">AYA:&emsp;&nbsp; (looks down) I was still a kid at that time.</p>
<p>Fade to young AYA running in a forest, with a hibiscus-like flower in her hand. She looks disheveled and worried. She trips over a root and falls. It is drizzling. AYA looks up. Cut to two Birds of Paradise flying in the sky. Young AYA looks at them from out of a hole in a tree trunk, clutching the flower tightly. She is so frightened that she started to cry.</p>
<p class="txt">AYA:&emsp;&nbsp; (voice-over) I went to seek enlightenment with my grandfather. I was lost when I went near to the Birds of Paradise…</p>
<p>The Birds suddenly turn around and fly towards the tree trunk that AYA is hiding in.</p>
<p class="txt">AYA:&emsp;&nbsp; …and was about to get eaten.</p>
<p>Cut to AYA closing her eyes in fear, bracing herself for the attack. Suddenly KOG leaps out and kicks a Bird of Paradise in the face. He springs off and slugs the other, breaking off a wing. Both birds fall to the ground. AYA look at KOG in awe. KOG smiles to AYA as he lands. Cut to KOG reaching his hand into the tree trunk.</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; Come on. Over here.</p>
<p>Cut to KOG carrying AYA in his arms.</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; Your grandfather must be worried.</p>
<p>Cut to KOG walking in the light drizzle, piggybacking AYA.</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; It's hard to be the Elder's granddaughter. Is your grandfather going to the North too?</p>
<p class="txt">AYA:&emsp;&nbsp; Yes. He said he'll seek for enlightenment with me.</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; I see… Are you going to use that flower for that?</p>
<p class="txt">AYA:&emsp;&nbsp; Yes. It has the same name as me. So I'm going to take it to the mountain. Erm…</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; Yes?</p>
<p class="txt">AYA:&emsp;&nbsp; Thank you for saving me.</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; Don't push yourself too hard. But, no matter how hard it is, (turns to AYA) you can still marry to me, Ayame. (smiles)</p>
<p class="txt">AYA:&emsp;&nbsp; Really?</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; Yes, I want you to be my wife.</p>
<p>AYA snuggles on KOG's back and smiles. Cut to nighttime on a cliff. KOG is still piggybacking AYA. It is full moon.</p>
<p class="txt">AYA:&emsp;&nbsp; (points) Look!</p>
<p>KOG stops:</p>
<p class="txt">AYA:&emsp;&nbsp; The rainbow!</p>
<p>A rainbow is seen across the nightsky.</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; It's the moon's rainbow!</p>
<p>Fade to present.</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; (nervous) I-Is t-that t-true? D-Did I r-really say t-that?</p>
<p>AYA nods. Tears stat to well up in her eyes.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;You simply don't remember such an important promise?!</p>
<p class="txt">AYA:&emsp;&nbsp; (clenches her fist tightly) Because of your promise… (shouts) I was able to stay in the mountain and went through all the hard times!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(furious) Wait, Koga! You really don't remember that? You're so bad!</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; (sweating) Kagome…</p>
<p>KOG looks at AYA, who started to cry anger tears.</p>
