<p class="header"><a name="1"></a>'Adult Swim' Synopsis</p>
<p>Sesshomaru, Inuyasha’s full-demon, evil half-brother is after a family inheritance, a powerful sword called the Tetsusaiga. Meanwhile, Inuyasha is miraculously reunited with his human mother, who supposedly died long ago.</p>

<p>Nighttime in a dark forest. A tall man with silver hair and a fur sash slung over his shoulder stands on a boulder, gazing intently at the moon. He has a purple crescent moon on his forehead, and two purple stripes across his cheeks. Cut to a stone structure on a mound, surrounded by boulders. A staff appears, floats towards the stone structure and stops. A short green reptilian creature with bulbous yellow eyes comes running and grabs the staff. He turns around.</p>
<p class="txt">Reptile: (excited) Wh--why! Lord Sesshomaru! Lord Sesshomaru!</p>
<p class="ttable">Sesshomaru abbreviated as SES from now onwards.</p>
<p class="txt">SES:&emsp;&nbsp; (walks up to the reptile) Is it here?</p>
<p class="txt">Reptile: Yes. (turns around to face the stone structure) The stake pointed in this direction, then lodged itself by this tomb. We’ll check it immediately.</p>
<p>The reptilian creature runs towards the structure. Wolves appear behind the boulders and snarl viciously.</p>
<p class="txt">Reptile: (taken aback and stops) Why would beasts respect a tomb? Lord Sesshomaru! This is it! There’s no mistake!</p>
<p>SES walks up to the reptilian creature, and continues walking forward calmly. The creature hides behind him and follows apprehensively, shooing the wolves. The wolves glare and snarl at them. One of them barks at SES.</p>
<p class="txt">SES:&emsp;&nbsp; (looking at the wolf’s teeth) The fang… I search for the fang. Once I possess it, I will be able to transform myself into an even greater power! (looks at the wolves) It seems my power is still insufficient, I’m still too naïve. Am I unsure of myself? No… I just don’t know my limits. (raises his hand and a green glow emits from it) I presume too much about my power…</p>
<p>All the wolves pounce towards SES. A green light ray emits from SES’s hand. He twirls around, the green light following him like a long ribbon.</p>
<p class="txt">SES:&emsp;&nbsp; The fang… I want the fang…</p>
<p>The wolves pounce on SES and are immediately annihilated by the green light whip surrounding SES.</p>

<p>Carcasses of wolves are scattered across the grass. SES stands in front of the stone structure, which has charms strung across it.</p>

<p class="ttable">Jaken, the reptilian creature, abbreviated as JAK from now on.</p>
<p class="txt">JAK:&emsp;&ensp; (runs up to the top of the structure) Yes, my lord.</p>
<p>JAK pokes the bottom end of his staff on the stone and waits. The two heads on the top of the staff have their eyes closed. (one female and one old man) The female head slowly rises and opens her eyes. Her mouths opens and shrieks.</p>
<p class="txt">JAK:&emsp;&ensp; The female’s face is screaming. Does that mean this is not the tomb you seek?</p>
<p>SES turns around and leaves.</p>
<p class="txt">JAK:&emsp;&ensp; Lord Sesshomaru, please wait!</p>

<p>A pack of wolves run across a plain. A flea with a human head (balding old man with large eyes) sits on one of the wolves, gripping onto its fur.</p>
<p class="txt">Flea: Dangerous, so dangerous! Just who is he anyway?! (to the wolf) Hurry! I must report this without delay! To Master Inuyasha!</p><br>
<p>At a campsite of a battalion of warriors. Most of the warriors are resting. A few of them sit in two rows in front of a fat general.</p>
<p class="txt">General: (lifting a boar carcass) We’ll meet up with the main troops tomorrow. Men! Eat boar’s meat tonight and energize yourselves!</p>
<p class="txt">Warrior 1: Yo! Such a man of strength and power is our lord and master!</p>
<p class="txt">Warrior 2: What an amazing man!</p>
<p class="txt">General: (grips the boar’s neck) I’ll take an enemy general’s head! (chuckles heartily)</p>
<p class="txt">Warrior 3: (background) Who goes there?! (attacked and falls onto the ground, revealing SES amidst the battalion)</p>
<p class="txt">General: (reaches the battalion) What’s the matter?</p>
<p class="txt">Warrior 4: My lord!</p>
<p class="txt">General: Why you… who are you?!</p>
<p class="txt">SES:&emsp;&nbsp; (calmly) A boat…</p>
<p class="txt">General: A boat? (laughs) Who has the luxury to lend you a boat in the middle of war!?</p>
<p class="txt">SES:&emsp;&nbsp; I want a boat.</p>
<p class="txt">General: What?!</p>
<p>The General runs towards SES. SES grabs his neck and snaps it. The General gasps for air. The battalion looks on in horror. SES flings the General onto a boat in a river nearby. The boat breaks and the General sinks into the water.</p>
<p class="txt">Warrior 5: (prepares his sword) Why you…! (the rest of the battalion follow suit)</p>
<p class="txt">JAK:&emsp;&ensp; (appears among the tall grass, looking perplexed) Lord Sesshomaru! I can’t find any boats in this area! (looks around him to find a lot of boats in the river) Huh? Oh…! So many boats! Leave it to Lord Sesshomaru!</p>
<p class="txt">Warrior 6: (to SES) Wh--what?</p>

<p class="txt">JAK:&emsp;&ensp; (walks towards the warriors) Yes, my lord.</p>
<p>JAK raises his staff high up in the air. The old man head on the staff opens his mouth and spews a torrent of fire towards the warriors. The warriors shout in pain.</p>
<p class="txt">JAK:&emsp;&ensp; (laughs) Feel the full power of my Human Head Staff!</p>
<p>JAK swings the staff around to burn more warriors. More cries of pain are heard. The fire eventually stops and the old man head closes his eyes and droop. The warriors are reduced to a charred steaming mess.</p>
<p class="txt">JAK:&emsp;&ensp; Hah! Not a piece left of them! Fools! If they hadn’t resisted us, they would still be alive. Wherever Lord Sesshomaru goes the powerholds of the samurai go astray. (turns around) It’s over and done with, my lord. (looks around) Huh? Please wait, my lord!</p>
<p>JAK starts to run after SES. Suddenly the eyes of the old man on the Human Head Staff glow an eerie red. JAK stops abruptly and lets go of the staff, which remains floating in the air.</p>
<p class="txt">JAK:&emsp;&ensp; Err… This is…?!</p>
<p>JAK's staff floats away, spins a little with the old man head facing another direction and continues floating away.</p>
<p class="txt">JAK:&emsp;&ensp; The staff changed directions? Is the location of the fang moving?</p>
<br>
<p>JAK and SES are on a boat traveling along a dark misty river. SES sits in front, while JAK rows behind him.</p>
<p class="txt">JAK:&emsp;&ensp; Lord Sesshomaru…</p>
<p class="txt">SES:&emsp;&nbsp; What is it?</p>
<p class="txt">JAK:&emsp;&ensp; The location of the tomb. I believe that Inuyasha knows where it is.</p>
<p class="txt">SES:&emsp;&nbsp; Inuyasha?</p>
<p>Without turning around, SES slaps JAK violently, which sends JAK falling into the river. JAK surfaces for air and SES pokes him on the forehead with his Human Head Staff, making him struggle along the surface of the water.</p>
<p class="txt">SES:&emsp;&nbsp; It’s a name I’d rather not remember…</p>
<p class="txt">JAK:&emsp;&ensp; Please forgive me!</p>
<p class="txt">SES:&emsp;&nbsp; Besides, he is not alive. (sinks the staff deeper) I heard that a spell was cast upon him fifty years ago.</p>
<p class="txt">JAK:&emsp;&ensp; (struggling for air and swimming desperately) Yes…but I have heard that the spell was undone only recently.</p>
<p>SES sinks the staff deeper, sending JAK underwater.</p>
<p class="txt">JAK:&emsp;&ensp; Also, my staff has been pointing in a different direction. I believe this has something to do with Inuyasha’s awakening. (talking underwater) By the way, my lord… Won’t you release the staff…? I can’t…breathe!</p>
<p>JAK’s cheeks balloon up and his eyes go haywire. He lets out a torrent of bubbles from his mouth, his body goes limp and falls away in comedic drama.</p><br>
<p>Daytime at the Dry Well in the Feudal Era. A pink bicycle appears out of the well, followed by KAG in casual wear. She hitches the heavy bicycle over the well and gets out.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(wiping sweat across her forehead) Huh… I’m exhausted.</p>
<p>Cut to KAG cycling peacefully across rice fields. Her thoughts are mingled with flashbacks of the previous episodes.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(thinking) How could an average middle-school girl like me get hurled into the Warring States period? My family are the protectors of an ancient shrine. We have a sacred thousand-year-old tree on the premises, a mysterious, secret well… I guess thinking back, it was a pretty strange shrine. The time warp to the Warring States period is connected to the secret well. And now all kinds of phantoms are after the Sacred Jewel which was hidden inside my body. The old priestess, Kaede, and the rest of the villagers are very kind, so I’ve been able to manage somehow. But it’s too frightening to think about all the demons that may come in pursuit of the Sacred Jewel.</p>
<p><span class="txtb">CUT TO FLASHBACK</span> of previous episode, the aftermath of INU and KAG’s fight with Yura.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Let’s go, Kagome.</p>

<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; What?</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;It’s the first time you said my name.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; So what?</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Maybe you’ve decided to be a bit nicer to me?</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Keh! Don’t get cheeky! Who’d be chums with a girl like you?!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;What?! And who was it that just saved you? (slaps INU’s back, who winces in pain and falls over) Look…if it hurts, just speak up and say so!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Shut up!</p>
<p><span class="txtb">BACK TO PRESENT.</span> Cut to KAG cycling across the rice fields.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Although he’s rough and rude and mean, in order to find the fragments of the Sacred Jewel, I hope Inuyasha and I can get along.</p><br>
<p>Cut to the flea that appeared earlier on. He hops heavily across some grass, and lands on a rock to rest and catch his breath.</p>
<p class="txt">Flea:&emsp; (wiping sweat across his forehead) I’ve been walking continuously for three days. Perhaps I will rest a bit.</p>
<p>The flea puts down his walking stick and sits. A bicycle bell is heard in the background.</p>
<p class="txt">Flea:&emsp; Huh? What’s that sound?</p>
<p>The flea turns around to find a bicycle wheel towering towards him, which proceeds to crush him, twice over with its two wheel. The flea yells. Pans upwards to find KAG riding the bicycle.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(turns around) What was that? My imagination, maybe?</p>
<p>KAG rides on and approaches KAE’s village.</p><br>
<p>In the village, INU is laying casually on a tree branch. KAG stands at the base of the tree, looking up at INU.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Tending to my wound? Forget it!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;No! It’s a serious wound. Get down.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (childish) Nope!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Come down, I said!</p>

<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Get one thing clear… I was the winner! Don’t you forget that!</p><br>
<p>Cut to KAE walking along a path with a few village kids following her. Her arm is bandaged up.</p>
<p class="txt">Child 1: Priestess Kaede, how is your injury?</p>
<p class="txt">KAE:&emsp;&ensp;It’s much better now.</p>
<p class="txt">Child 1: I hope the fragments of the Sacred Jewel can be found soon!</p>
<p class="txt">KAE:&emsp;&ensp;(laughs) You children need not worry your heads about it. But if Inuyasha and Kagome could get along for a while longer, that would be a big help.</p>
<p class="txt">Child 1: (laughs and points) Looks like they’re getting along fine.</p>
<p>Near them, where the child is pointing to, KAG is sitting on top of INU, grabbing onto his clothes. INU struggles.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Just undress!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Cut it out!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Undress!</p>
<p class="txt">KAE:&emsp;&ensp;(to the kids) Do not look!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Huh?!</p>
<p class="txt">KAE:&emsp;&ensp;It seems as though you’re starting to get along.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Huh?!</p>
<p>Both of them are embarrassed. INU gets up suddenly, making KAG fall onto the ground</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;You!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Can’t you understand that my body is different?! (shows KAG his chest where his injury used to be)</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Huh…?! It’s already healed.</p>
<p class="txt">KAE:&emsp;&ensp;That terrible injury is healed… And not even a scar! Amazing!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Keh! Don’t compare me mortals! I ain’t flattered at all by your amazement!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(thinking) He’s not human, but he’s not a demon. So what is a half-demon…?</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (arranges his clothes) Oww!</p>
<p>INU yelps suddenly and looks at his chest. The flea earlier on is feeding on his blood and gets a little bigger.</p>
<p class="txt">Flea:&emsp; (stops sucking and looks up) Greetings, Master Inuyasha!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (slaps the flea and looks at it, a flattened version on his palm) Huh? Why if it ain’t ol’ Myoga the Flea!</p>
<p class="ttable">Myoga abbreviated as MYO from now onwards.</p>
<p>MYO slides off INU’s palm and onto the ground.</p>

<p class="txt">MYO:&emsp; (stands up and fattens himself) It has been so long, Master Inuyasha! (A gust of ‘wind’ blows at him) So long… Master Inuyasha…</p>
<p>MYO struggles and falls onto the ground. Pan upwards to see KAG spraying a can of insecticide at MYO with a determined look.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (puzzled) What’d you do?</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(puzzled) Shouldn’t I have?</p><br>
<p>Evening at the village. The village kids are examining KAG’s bicycle curiously. The group gathers around a fire in KAE’s hut.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Men are trying to violate my old man’s tomb?</p>
<p class="txt">MYO:&emsp; I, Myoga, protector of the tomb, could bear it no longer and here I am.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; You abandoned the tomb and ran away?!</p>
<p class="txt">MYO:&emsp; But that tomb was just stone. The urn itself is in another location.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Then where is it?</p>

<p>Cut-scene of a battalion of warriors firing arrows at a huge dog. The dog growls and flies into the air. The image fades to an illustration, showing the majesty of the dog. Cut to KAE’s hut.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (resting his face on his hand) I don’t remember much about ’im.</p>
<p class="txt">MYO:&emsp; He was a magnificent and powerful demon. And his blood was so flavorful. Master Inuyasha has inherited the tasty blood from his father.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(curious) Hmmm… and his mother?</p>
<p class="txt">MYO:&emsp; His mother was very beautiful.</p>
<p>INU stamps on MYO with his heel and twists it in anger.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Inuyasha! Don’t be so rough!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; My mother died a long time ago! (storms out of the hut)</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Why? Did I say something to anger him?</p>
<p class="txt">KAE:&emsp;&ensp;Hmmm… I do not know.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;All I did was ask about his mother.</p>
<p class="txt">MYO:&emsp; Master Inuyasha is always like that when the subject turns to his mother.</p>
<p>KAE remains silent and tends to the fire. KAG looks puzzled and thinks for awhile. She gets up.</p><br>
<p>Nighttime, INU is sitting on his tree, staring into space and looking pissed off. KAG appears in the background and cycles towards the tree. She gets off the bicycle and pushes it along.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(thinking) His father was a full-fledged demon. And Inuyasha is a half-demon. Half demon…does that mean the other half is human? Is that why…?</p>

<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Can you feel it? There’s something weird coming.</p>
<p>In the sky, the silhouette of a palanquin is seen floating across the sky, backlit by the moon. Several demons guard the palanquin.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;A noble’s palanquin?</p>
<p>Tthe screen of the palanquin flies open, revealing a woman in chains inside.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;There’s a lady inside.</p>

<p class="txt">INU’s mother: Inuyasha! Inuyasha!</p>
<p>The palanquin flies towards a cloud swirl in the sky, from which a gigantic demon claw reaches out and crashes it. The rest of the demon appears, with eerie red eyes, among the clouds and clenching Inuyasha’s mother tightly in his fist. Inuyasha’s mother looks unconscious.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Inuyasha, your mother!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; You… (leaps into the air but a torrent of fire surges suddenly towards him) Damn!</p>
<p>Pan upwards to reveal that it was JAK who released the fire from his Human Head Staff. He is standing on the arm of the huge demon. INU lands and curses JAK. SES appears, standing on the shoulder of the giant demon.</p>
<p class="txt">SES:&emsp;&nbsp; Jaken.</p>

<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Are you stupid?! My mother died a long time ago! As if I’d fall for such a trick!</p>
<p class="txt">SES:&emsp;&nbsp; Trick, huh?</p>
<p class="txt">JAK:&emsp;&ensp; Do you not understand? Bringing dead spirits from the netherworld is a simple task for someone as great as Lord Sesshomaru. He was so kind as to give her flesh! Her own son won’t believe that it’s her. How mortifying it must be for your mother!</p>

<p>Little demon imps tug at the chains around her and she faints from the pain.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Damn! Iron Reaver-Soul Stealer!</p>
<p>INU leaps up and claws the giant demon’s hand, cutting it into two. The fist which was clenching INU’s mother falls to the ground. The demon growls in pain. INU lands. The little demons which were tugging at INU’s mother flee once they land on the ground.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(running) Are you all right, Inuyasha’s mother?</p>

<p class="txt">INU’s mother: Inuyasha!</p>
<p>INU blocks the demon’s hand from his mother and the hand stabs into his back instead. She gasps in horror and holds out a white glowing orb in her hand, which enlarges and engulfs INU, KAG and her. SES shields his face from the bright light. When the bright light stops, INU, his mother and KAG are gone.</p>
<p class="txt">SES:&emsp;&nbsp; What a nuisance.</p>
<p class="txt">JAK:&emsp;&ensp; It’s going well, my lord. Just leave everything to Jaken!</p>

<p class="txt">INU’s mother: It was a violent age. And I left you… all alone with no one to care for you. Forgive me. (stops and turns  to INU) How you must have suffered.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (turns around and folds arms) It wasn’t your fault.</p>
<p class="txt">INU’s mother: (gently) Inuyasha… </p>
<p>INU turns around to face her. Cut to KAG waking. </p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(thinking) Huh?! Inuyasha and his mother… They’re okay. (tries to get up, thinking) Wh-what… My body… I can’t move!</p>
<p>KAG ooks at INU and his mother, and notices her reflection in the pond.</p>
<p class="txt"> KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Huh?! There’s no face in the reflection! Inuyasha! My voice… I can’t speak!</p>
<p>INU’s mother walks to his side.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Mother…</p>
<p class="txt">INU’s mother: Parting is so sad… Inuyasha.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Yes…</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Have you realized it, Inuyasha? She doesn’t have a face! She’s not your mother!</p>
<p>Cut to the reflection of INU and his mother’s in the pond. They face each other, a little sideways, but there are no facial features on the face of INU’s mother.</p>

<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Inuyasha fights hard to save his mother. Looking at the kimono on his mother, Inuyasha should be from a noble familly! But Inuyasha is so uncouth! Sesshomaru sets a trap for Inuyasha using his nostalgia for his mother. Inuyasha, that's not your mother! Next episode, '<a href="ep06.htm">Tetsusaiga, the Phantom Sword</a>'!</p><br>
