Koga and Inuyasha, having fallen into Naraku's trap, start a duel to the death! Naraku's motive is the Sacred Jewel fragments! He wants Koga's fragments, but don't want to use his own strength, so he makes use of Inuyasha! Tetsusaiga has been knocked off, and Inuyasha's right arm is broken! Even though he's faced with these double blows, Inuyasha won't concede to this female demon! Next episode, 'Wind-User Kagura, Bewitching Trap'!</p>
<p class="header"><a name="1"></a>'Adult Swim' Synopsis</p>
<p>While Inuyasha and Koga fight, Sango and Miroku head into Naraku's castle, only to encounter more poisonous insects and Naraku's demon puppet. Outside, Koga puts Inuyasha down for the count, only to come face-to-face with the sorceress Kagura. Kagome finds herself in the strange position of coming to Koga's aid.</p>

At first the pattern is half pink and half blue with light blue stripes and leaves on the blue part. Then when she confronts Naraku, she wears a white kimono with red stripes and some sort of design. The second kimono is the one that she continuously wears from here on. <span class="contri">{Jess}</span> (see images) </li>

<p>Cut to INU surrounded by the Wolf-Demons. Their bodies are raised high into the air and flies towards INU.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; W-what…?!</p>
<p>KAR closes her fan and the bodies of the Wolf-Demons falls apart. Blood from their bodies gush onto INU's clothes and hands. KOG reaches the castle and lands on the roof. He surveys the scene and gasps in horror to find his tribesmen dead around INU.</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; Why that…!</p>
<p>INU looks around and notices KOG.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(thinking) Koga!</p>
<p>INU and KOG fight.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(voice-over) Naraku's trap! Koga went after Inuyasha, believing that his comrades had been killed by him. The glow in his right arm was not from a Sacred Jewel fragment. With greater ferocity, Koga attacked Inuyasha!</p>
<p>Cut to a wooden thing falling onto the ground in a room. It is the thing used to control NAR's puppets.</p>
<p class="txt">KAR:&emsp;&nbsp; He says this should keep you busy.</p>
<p>KAR fades away. The puppet glows and turns into the a baboon with thick root-like limbs, similar to that of episode 25. SAN and MIR face off with the puppet.</p>

<p>The root-like limbs of NAR's puppet elongates and circle around SAN and MIR.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; (raising his staff) As usual, the baboon likes to make things complicated.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;While those hotheads fight it out their way, we get to take on a demon puppet. He takes us lightly. (unsheathes her sword)</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Don't let your guard down. We're inside Naraku's castle. Who knows what traps have been laid.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Damn these traps. I've had just about enough!</p>
<p>SAN jumps with her sword prepared. Roots suddenly crash in from the ceiling and attack SAN, who slice them away. She lands next to MIR.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Shall we teach them?</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;A measly demon puppet is no match against us!</p>
<p>SAN and MIR attack the limbs of the puppet.</p><br>
<p>Cut to courtyard. INU runs across the roof while KOG chases from the ground. KOG leaps onto the roof and attacks INU. INU dodges, and KOG hits the roof instead. The roof explodes. INU jumps off and lands on the ground.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Damn! Where's he getting that brute strength?!</p>
<p>KOG gets up. Cut to SHI on KIR's back. KAG stands next to them.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; Ooh! The roof's been blown off! The power of that right arm isn't normal!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;What'll we do? We have to stop them quickly!</p>
<p>Cut to ground full of corpses of Wolf-Demons.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;It's not Inuyasha who killed Koga's friends… It was Naraku!</p>
<p>Cut to close up of KOG.</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; Damn mutt! I'll never forgive you!</p>
<p>KOG jumps off the roof and swings his fist in INU's direction. INU dodges. KOG chases him and throw punches at him hotheadedly. One of his punch on the ground causes a long split which head in KAG's direction. KIR leaps into the air to dodge the attack, with KAG in her mouth and SHI on her back.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Kirara!</p>
<p>KIR lands on one of the roofs higher up. KAG is still dazed by the turn of events.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; Kirara, good work!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(regain her composure) Thank you, Kirara!</p>
<p>KIR growls and look in INU's direction.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Kagome! (to KOG) Damn you!</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; Jumping around, trying to escape! If Kagome is ever hurt, it'd be your fault!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Naraku wants us to fight until one of us dies. I don't intend to fall into Naraku's trap, but…! (unsheathes TET) You've pushed me this far… I'm not holding back!</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; (waves his fist which glows) Prepare to die! I'm avenging my comrades! (sprints towards INU)</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (thinking) He's fast!</p>
<p>KOG punches INU, who blocks with TET's blade. TET is thrown out of INU's hand by the impact.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (raising his claws) Iron-Reaver, Soul-Stealer—!</p>
<p>INU and KOG both rush towards each other and attack, INU with his claws and KOG with his fist. INU's claws clash with KOG's punch. They continue moving forward. INU lets out a groan. Cut to KOG braking and turning back to face INU. Cut to INU braking and turning around to face KOG.</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; (scoffs and raise his Sacred Jewel fragment imbued arm) What?! Did I claw you just now?</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (grabs his right arm, thinking) This is bad… He smashed my arm bone.</p>
<p>KOG leaps into the air and punches INU in the face. He gives him another kick in the face. INU manage to dodge one attack but is subsequently kicked in the face again. INU crashes onto the ground, rolling several times.</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; (leaps into the air with raised fist) This is the end for you!</p>
<p>KOG punches INU in the chest dramatically. The ground around them shatter and is surrounded in light. Cut to KAG looking on from the roof.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Inuyasha!</p>
<p>Cut to INU and KOG. INU lies in a big hole in the ground. KOG removes his fist from INU's chest. There is a huge wound in INU's chest and he looks unconscious.</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; He's dead…</p>
<p>KAR suddenly appears and walks towards KOG.</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; (turns around) Who are you?!</p>
<p class="txt">KAR:&emsp;&nbsp; (smiling) Mr. Wolf Man…now you have no regrets, huh?</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; Just who are you?</p>
<p class="txt">KAR:&emsp;&nbsp; I'm Kagura. Now I'll let you have your last dance. (opens her fan and the corpses of the Wolf-Demons rise up)</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; (looking around) W-what?! What's happening?! Aren't they dead?</p>
<p class="txt">KAR:&emsp;&nbsp; They may be dead, but they want to dance. They're so happy they can dance with you.</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; (brows twitching in anger) You…! You're the one who killed my friends!</p>
<p class="txt">KAR:&emsp;&nbsp; Well… I forget.</p>
<p>KAR waves her fan and flip it downwards. The corpses are raised up into the air and flung towards KOG. KOG leaps and punches them out of the way, one by one. He lands a distance in front of KAR.</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; (sprints towards KAR with raised fist) I'll kill you!</p>
<p>Suddenly, the wound on KOG's arm flashes red. Cut to close up of the Sacred Jewel imbued in his arm.</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; (stops and falls on his knees, thinking) I can't move… What's happened to my body?</p>
<p class="txt">KAR:&emsp;&nbsp; (laughs) The poison in the fragment in your arm is starting to work. (raise her fan) Well, I guess it's time to start.</p>
<p>KAR swings her fan with sends wind blades towards KOG. The wind blades cut through KOG and he is heavily injured. He grimaces in pain and fall face down to the ground.</p>
<p class="txt">KAR:&emsp;&nbsp; Can't move, can you? The fragment you have imbedded in your arm… It's a fake Sacred Jewel made from crystallized poison and miasma. You jumped around so much, it sped up the spread of the poison.</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; Damn! (winces in pain)</p>
<p class="txt">KAR:&emsp;&nbsp; Now then, I'll have the real fragments you have.</p>
<p>The Sacred Jewel fragments in KOG's legs glow. An arrow suddenly fly towards KAR's back. She notices and uses the Wolf-Demon corpses to block it. The corpses disintegrates.</p>
<p class="txt">KAR:&emsp;&nbsp; So that's the sacred arrow? (turns around and send wind blades towards KAG, SHI and KIR)</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; It's coming!</p>
<p>The roof explodes. Cut to KIR on the other side of the roof, biting on KAG's collar, who is about to fall off.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; (on KIR's back) Kagome, are you all right?!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;I-I think so. (wipes a sweat off her forehead)</p>
<p>Cut to KAR.</p>
<p class="txt">KAR:&emsp;&nbsp; Not impressive at all. But I won't let you get in my way. (raises her fan but notices something behind and stops) Huh?!</p>
<p>Cut to INU struggling to get up, using TET as a clutch.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (weakly but firmly) Don't you dare lay a finger on Kagome… I'll take you on!</p>
<p class="txt">KAR:&emsp;&nbsp; So you're still alive? Mr. Wolf Man, you didn't complete your job.</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; Inuyasha…</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Keh! As if I'd die from a blow from that puny wolf cub!</p>
<p class="txt">KAR:&emsp;&nbsp; You want you fight me…in that condition?</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Lemme tell you this… I'll show you no mercy! Bathing me in the blood of the Wolf-Demons and setting that fool on to me wasn't nice at all…but what I can't stand more is the scent of Naraku that reeks from you!</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; Naraku?</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Just the thought of Naraku enables me to move my wounded body!</p>
<p>INU leaps with a transformed TET. KAR blocks it with a wind blade. INU is pushed backwards.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (thinking) She thwarted the Tetsusaiga with such little wind power. With just one arm, I can draw only half its power!</p>
<p class="txt">KAR:&emsp;&nbsp; I am the Wind Sorceress. The wind in this castle is under my control. (swings her fan in a full circle) Dance of the Wind Sword!</p>
<p>A vortex of wind emerges around KAR and surges towards INU. INU struggles to keep his position. Mini cyclones also surge towards INU, who dodges.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (thinking) This is her ghostly wind. The point where the winds collide…the Wind Scar! Where Tetsusaiga can attain its greatest power! If I cut it through…I can destroy her!</p>
<p>INU creates a vortex of wind around him too.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (thinking) What's happening?! What's wrong? I can't see the Wind Scar anywhere around Kagura!</p>
<p>KAR flicks her fan which sends more mini-cyclones at INU. The wind vortex around INU dissipates. INU gasps in shock. KAR's words earlier on flashes back in INU's mind.</p>
<p class="txt">KAR:&emsp;&nbsp; (voice-over) I am the Wind Sorceress. The wind in this castle is under my control!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; That means…my wind is also under her control!</p>
<p>INU creates another vortex around himself. Cut to SHI and KAG hiding inside the roof.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; Something's wrong with Inuyasha! It's like he can't move his right arm!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;This time… (draws her arrow at KAR) Hit the target!</p>
<p>KAG fires her arrow which hits the ground near KAR.</p>
<p class="txt">KAR:&emsp;&nbsp; Where is she aiming?</p>
<p>The glowing arrow twists the wind vortex around KAR.</p>
<p class="txt">KAR:&emsp;&nbsp; Huh?!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Kagome's sacred arrow! Kagura's ghostly wind is being blown away! All right! There is a way to create the Wind Scar! Kagome! Shoot an arrow at me! Stop dallying! Hurry and shoot!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;What are you thinking?! Inuyasha, if this arrow hits you…even you could die! But…I must have faith in Inuyasha!</p>
<p>KAG fires another arrow in INU's direction, which dissipates his wind vortex. The arrow that KAG previously shot also dissipates KAR's wind.</p>
<p class="txt">KAR:&emsp;&nbsp; (shocked, thinking) This arrow is purifying my ghostly wind.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; I knew it! The ghostly wind has disappeared!</p>
<p class="txt">KAR:&emsp;&nbsp; Fool! Wind is easily created!</p>
<p>KAR swings her fan and a wind vortex appears around herself. At the same time, INU also creates a wind vortex around himself. The wind vortexes slowly collide into each other.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (thinking) When the two ghostly winds appear once more…the Wind Scar…will be created! (swings TET) Take that!</p>
<p>INU uses the Wind Scar and attacks KAR. KAR gasps in horror while her clothes are burnt away by the fire from TET.</p>
<p class="txt">KAR:&emsp;&nbsp; The Wind Scar…!</p>
<p>KAR takes out a feather and it becomes bigger which transports KAR away. Cut to view of KAR's back, which reveals a spider shaped burn scar.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (thinking) What's that?! That scar?!</p>
<p>KAR floats away on her feather.</p><br>
<p>In the mansion. MIR's staff is thrust into the head of the baboon puppet. SAN leaps and slashes its body into two with her sword. The wooden puppet thing is slashed into two. The puppet disintegrates. Cut to exterior view of castle. The buildings slowly fade away. Cut to KAG and SHI flying on KIR's back.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; The castle is disappearing!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;This castle was an illusion, too!</p><br>
<p>Cut to INU standing in a forest clearing, (where the castle courtyard was). MIR and SAN run up to him.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Inuyasha! Are you all right?!</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Where's that woman?!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; I let her get away… I couldn't use my broken right arm…so I couldn't deliver the finishing blow.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(in the background) Koga! Are you all right?!</p>
<p>Cut to KOG lying on the ground, struggling in pain. His arm has turned purple. SHI, KAG and KIR reach him.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; The color in the skin is different. The poison from the fake fragment is spreading!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;What'll we do?! We can't let him die! (reaches for KOG's arm but is deflected)</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; It's no use. The barrier is too strong. It deflected your hands, Kagome.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;But we must do something quickly!</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; Are you sure, Kagome? I tried to kill Inuyasha…</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;What are you saying?! You were just tricked by Naraku! Even Inuyasha has no desire to settle it like this. (INU walks towards them) Inuyasha…?</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Since we both fell right into Naraku's trap, if you only want to save his life, there's a way. Hold out your arm! (raises TET) I'll chop it off with the fake jewel!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;No! Just wait, Inuyasha! There must be another way!</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; That's right! We can't touch the barrier… but Kagome, the sacred arrow can dissolve the barrier!</p>
<p>KAG takes her arrow and points it near KOG's arm, which dissolved the barrier. A pink light surround the arm and the fake Jewel is taken out. It shatters. KOG's arm resume its normal color. The group gather around KOG.</p><br>
<p>Fade to KOG lying on the ground alone.</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; (gets up, thinking) Kagura who killed my comrades and Naraku… (winces in pain) with my own hands… (walks on) Someday… I will kill them…</p><br>
<p>Fade to INU-gang on a cliff, looking at KOG walking away. INU turns around and walks on, but is grasped with pain and winces. KIR looks at INU and snuggles around him. INU pats her head. Cut to KAG, MIR and SHI.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;I wonder if Koga will be okay?</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; He looks like a very proud man. Better to let him be.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; (on MIR's shoulder) It's a funny way to put it… but we're used to being tricked by Naraku.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Now then… let's see how strong the other proud one is.</p>
<p>Cut to INU sleeping on KIR.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; He's fast asleep.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; He fought so hard. Even Inuyasha must be exhausted.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; We should let him sleep.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;She had the same spider-shaped burn scar on her back… like Naraku. I wonder what that means?</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; A woman who has the same scent as Naraku.</p>

<p class="txt">KAR:&emsp;&nbsp; Shut up! You tricked me, didn't you? You never told me about the power of that Inuyasha's sword!</p>
<p class="txt">NAR:&emsp;&ensp;The sword that cuts through the Wind Scar. I wondered just how powerful it was but if you can make it back alive, I guess it wasn't much of a sword.</p>
