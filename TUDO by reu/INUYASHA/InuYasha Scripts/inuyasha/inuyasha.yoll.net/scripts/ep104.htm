<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;To find the Sacred Jewel fragments,</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; I have to defeat Naraku with this Tetsusaiga!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;The zombies, Shichinintai, continue to get in our way. Naraku lies somewhere ahead. Sesshomaru, who followed him here, appeared once again.</p>

<p class="txtb"><a name="AI"></a>[ ACT I ]</p>
<p>Recap from previous episode, when INU fought Jakotsu [JKS] and punches him in the face. JKS is flung off from the punch. He somersaults and lands.</p>
<p class="txt">JKS:&emsp;&ensp; (rubs his face in a whiny tone) How cold.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Shut up! You better confess who gave you the Sacred Jewel fragment!</p>
<p>Cut to INU and JKS facing off each other. On the hill at one side of the valley, a chubby zombie with a toad-like voice steps up.</p>
<p class="txt">Zombie: (chuckles) What a good one… That Jakotsu hasn't changed a bit.</p>
<p>The zombie takes out a bamboo container from his basket. He opens it a little and takes a sip. He coughs out huge clouds of black fumes.</p>
<p class="txt">Zombie: That's a nice taste.</p>
<p>The zombie then opens the container fully. Dark fumes rush out.</p><br>
<p class="txtb">[ Title screen: The Stealthy Poison User, Mukotsu ]</p><br>
<p>Cut to INU and JKS.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Jakotsu, is Naraku the one who gave you the Sacred Jewel fragment?!</p>
<p class="txt">JKS:&emsp;&ensp; I've no clue. I've never met him.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Bastard! Stop making excuses!</p>
<p>The fumes flow down the slop gradually.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (gasps) Smoke!</p>
<p class="txt">JKS:&emsp;&ensp; It's that jerk, Mukotsu. (scowls) Getting in my way… Inuyasha, you should run away too. (turns)</p>
<p class="ttable">The chubby zombie, Mukotsu, abbreviated as MKS from now onwards.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; What sort of trick is this, bastard?!</p>
<p>The fumes reaches INU and burns his feet. He winces in pain and retreats to where the rest of the group is.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; What on earth was that?</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;That's poisonous smoke.</p>
<p class="txt">JKS:&emsp;&ensp; (running off, chirpy) Let's meet again, Inuyasha!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; That bastard…</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Where did the smoke come from?</p>
<p>Pan upwards to the hill. MKS walks off.</p><br>
<p>SES-gang is walking in a forest.</p>
<p class="txt">JAK:&emsp;&ensp; Naraku…! Just wait! I'll beat him up and throw him into the depths of Hell. (chuckles)</p>
<p class="txt">SES:&emsp; (stops, thinking) I smell it…this is…</p>
<p><span class="txtb">CUT TO FLASHBACK </span>from episode 80, when Kagura kidnapped Rin. KOH is about to kill Rin when SES appears behind him.</p>
<p class="txt">SES:&emsp; (voice-over) Naraku's servant. That boy's smell…</p>
<p><span class="txtb">BACK TO PRESENT.</span> The group continues walking.</p>
<p class="txt">Rin:&emsp;&emsp;Lord Sesshomaru, why are you after Naraku?</p>
<p class="txt">JAK:&emsp;&ensp; Silly girl… He's angry because you were abducted by Naraku.</p>
<p class="txt">Rin:&emsp;&emsp;(happy) For Rin?</p>
<p class="txt">JAK:&emsp;&ensp; Don't get conceited, silly girl. Lord Sesshomaru cares about his pride. He may look calm, but he'll want revenge after being humiliated.</p>
<p>SES has stopped. JAK, busy with talking, bumps into him. JAK looks at SES, who is glaring at him.</p>
<p class="txt">JAK:&emsp;&ensp; Scary eyes…</p>
<p>Cut to close-up of flower. A thumping sound is heard. Cut to JAK on the ground with a huge bump on his head. SES walks on.</p>
<p class="txt">JAK:&emsp;&ensp; Am I so hated…?</p>
<p class="txt">Rin:&emsp;&emsp;Are you okay?</p><br>
<p>Cut to a path. A Poison Insect is observing INU from afar. KAG is applying some balm on SAN's wound.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Does it hurt, Sango?</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;I'm okay.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; That bastard, Jakotsu. He can't have gone far.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Are we going after him?</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Of course! We've yet to get any clues from him yet!</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; But Inuyasha… What do you think of the poisonous smoke?</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Poisonous smoke?</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; It seemed Jakotsu knew something.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; It may just be another of the Shichinintai.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Does that mean another zombie escaped?</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Miroku, stay here and protect Kagome and Sango.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Understood!</p>
<p>INU runs off.</p><br>
<p>Cut to Mukotsu [MKS] kneeling in a forest clearing, grinding some herbs. He pours some poison from a container into the mixture, mumbling to himself. JKS appears behind him.</p>
<p class="txt">MKS:&emsp;&ensp;Yo, Jakotsu. It's been awhile.</p>
<p class="txt">JKS:&emsp;&ensp; (steps on MKS's head) Bastard. (squats and puts hand on MKS's head) Mukotsu, you tried to melt me earlier. (slaps his head)</p>
<p class="txt">MKS:&emsp;&ensp;(laughs) Don't get mad. I just wanted to say hi.</p>
<p class="txt">JKS:&emsp;&ensp; (scoffs) Keh.</p>
<p class="txt">MKS:&emsp;&ensp;So, what happened to the others?</p>
<p class="txt">JKS:&emsp;&ensp; Brother Renkotsu is taking care of Ginkotsu.</p>
<p class="txt">MKS:&emsp;&ensp;What's wrong with Ginkotsu?</p>
<p class="txt">JKS:&emsp;&ensp; Well, you know how he is. He needs new gunpowder and what not.</p>
<p class="txt">MKS:&emsp;&ensp;Yeah, got to oil him up too.</p>
<p class="txt">Both:&emsp;&ensp;(look up) Huh?</p>
<p>A Poison Insect appears, fluttering its wings.</p>
<p class="txt">JKS:&emsp;&ensp; (to Poison Insect) What did you say?</p>
<p>The Insect flies away.</p>
<p class="txt">JKS:&emsp;&ensp; (excited) What?! Inuyasha is alone and after me?!</p>
<p class="txt">MKS:&emsp;&ensp;The humans and the fox child are the only ones left then… That girl, Kagome, has the Sacred Jewel fragments.</p>
<p class="txt">JKS:&emsp;&ensp; I'll leave those guys to you.</p>
<p class="txt">MKS:&emsp;&ensp;Is it really okay? I'll be taking the Sacred Jewel fragments.</p>
<p class="txt">JKS:&emsp;&ensp; And, I'll take Inuyasha.</p>
<p class="txt">MKS:&emsp;&ensp;Well, I don't want him.</p>
<p>JKS starts walking.</p>
<p class="txt">MKS:&emsp;&ensp;Can I take the girls?</p>
<p class="txt">JKS:&emsp;&ensp; (shrugs) Take them. I don't need them for sure.</p>
<p>MKS chuckles and pours the mixture into a bamboo container.</p>
<p class="txt">MKS:&emsp;&ensp;Alright.</p><br>
<p>A warrior with a blue scarf over his head and purple lines across his face walks into a temple. Monks are sweeping in the courtyard. The warrior surveys the area. An old monk walks up to him.</p>
<p class="txt">Monk:&emsp;Do you have any business here at the temple?</p>
<p class="txt">Warrior: Yes, I do. This temple will do.</p>
<p class="txt">Monk:&emsp;Sorry?</p>
<p class="txt">Warrior: Well, the Shichinintai, will take over this temple now.</p>
<p class="txt">Monk:&emsp;Shichinintai?! Are you a zombie?!</p>
<p class="txt">Warrior/Zombie: Those clothes of yours will suit me just fine. (smiles)</p>
<p>The old man runs away. The zombie leaps. A loud yell of pain is heard.</p><br>
<p>KAG is cycling towards a well, in a misty area. SHI is in the basket.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; Hey, Kagome, there's a well!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Yeah, let's refill our water.</p>
<p>KAG stops the bike near the well. A woman is lying unconscious near the well.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; Someone has fainted…</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;That's bad…! Are you alright? (rushes to woman and gasps) She's dead.</p>
<p>They look around the area. Villagers are all dead around them a bird flies down, whimpers and dies.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;What's going on?!</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; (on KAG's shoulder) Kagome, we got to get away from here.</p>
<p>KAG backs away from the area. Laughter is heard and black fumes appear.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(covers mouth) Poisonous smoke!</p>
<p class="txt">MKS:&emsp;&ensp;You can't ran away from Lord Mukotsu's poison.</p>
<p>MKS appears before KAG, holding out a container with black fumes. KAG becomes weaker and falls to her knees. SHI jumps off her shoulder.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; Kagome. Hang in there!</p>
<p class="txt">MKS:&emsp;&ensp;So, you're the girl with the Sacred Jewel fragments.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; Kagome. Kagome!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(panting) Run… Shippo…</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; No way!</p>
<p class="txt">MKS:&emsp;&ensp;Don't worry, I won't kill you right away. With this poison, you'll be paralyzed first and lose your consciousness later. It's Lord Mukotsu's special mixture. The only downside is that it doesn't work on demons.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; Don't you touch Kagome! Fox Magic! Crushing Top!!</p>
<p>SHI jumps and throws a toy top, which enlarges and spins on MKS's head. MKS winces.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; How's that?!</p>
<p>The top reverts to its toy size. MKS lifts his veil a little and spits poison fumes at SHI. SHI falls back and struggles desperately.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Shippo…</p>
<p>MKS walks to SHI and kicks him away vindictively. He then advances to KAG. Suddenly HIR flies out and smashes the bamboo container in MKS's hands. KIR, MIR and SAN (wearing a gas mask) arrive at the scene.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Stay back, Priest. It's poisonous.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; (backs away, covers mouth) So, the poisonous smoke was his doing…</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(thinking) Don't come near, Sango… Miroku…</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; (gets up and runs) Wait for me, I'll go get Inuyasha!</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Damn it! Are you one of the Shichinintai?!</p>
<p class="txt">MKS:&emsp;&ensp;(laughs) That's right. I'm Mukotsu, the poison user.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Someone resurrected you and made you guys come after us. Is Naraku behind all these?!</p>
<p class="txt">MKS:&emsp;&ensp;(laughs) I don't know. You'll have to ask my brothers. That's only if you can find them.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(thinking) Run…!</p>
<p>MKS reaches into his basket and takes out another container. He opens it and black fumes rush at MIR, SAN and KIR. SAN blocks with HIR.</p>
<p class="txt">MKS:&emsp;&ensp;Melt!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(weakly) Sango… Miroku…</p>
<p>The fumes dissipate. KIR, MIR and SAN have fainted.</p>
<p class="txt">MKS:&emsp;&ensp;Alright girl… I've gotten rid of the busybodies. Now it's just the two of us.</p>
<p class="txtb">[ End of ACT 1: 10min 20sec ]</p><br>
<p class="txtb"><a name="AII"></a>[ ACT II ]</p>
<p>Cut to SHI riding on his toy horse in the air.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; Inuyasha! Where are you?!</p><br>
<p>Cut to INU sprinting in the forest.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (thinking) It's nearby… Jakotsu's scent…</p>
<p>INU reaches a forest clearing. He stops and is taken aback. JKS is standing on a trunk, shaking his clothes.</p>
<p class="txt">JKS:&emsp;&ensp; (glad) Hey, Inuyasha!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; What the hell are you doing?</p>
<p class="txt">JKS:&emsp;&ensp; (chirpy) You came after my smell right? See, this way you'll be able to smell me from afar.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (unsheathes TET) Go to hell!</p><br>
<p>Cut to a hut on a hill enveloped in fumes. Cut to inside of hut. KAG is lying frozen on the ground. MKS holds out a long piece of white cloth and squats next to KAG.</p>
<p class="txt">MKS:&emsp;&ensp;There's a poisonous barrier around us. No one will come and save you. Well, you're quite a pretty girl… (holds KAG's face) I'm so happy that I can go through <i>Shuugen</i> with you.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(thinking) What's <i>Shuugen</i>?</p>
<p class="txt">MKS:&emsp;&ensp;(removes veil) With a face like this, I'm not too popular with women. I'll treat you like a bride. Then, you can go through <i>Shuugen</i> with me.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(thinking) <i>Shuugen</i>… Did he mean wedding?</p>
<p>MKS laughs happily as he holds the white cloth towards KAG.</p><br>
<p>Cut to INU and JKS fighting each other. INU is having a hard time dodging JKS's sword.</p>
<p class="txt">JKS:&emsp;&ensp; (maniacal) Keep running!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Quite playing a fool!</p>
<p>INU stops running. A wind vortex appears around TET.</p>
<p class="txt">JKS:&emsp;&ensp; I like your angry face too!</p>
<p>JKS throws his sword towards INU who blocks with TET. The wind vortex dissipates.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (thinking) His sword is chasing away the wind that gathers around Tetsusaiga…!</p>
<p class="txt">JKS:&emsp;&ensp; The fun begins now!</p>
<p>JKS throws his blade at INU, who leaps and somersaults behind JKS.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; It's all over once I stop the movement of your sword!</p>
<p class="txt">JKS:&emsp;&ensp; (mocks) Do you think you can stop this Snake-Bone sword of mine?</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (points TET) Bring it on!</p>
<p>SHI appears overhead on his toy horse.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; (shouts) Inuyasha! Another Shichinintai has captured Kagome! Kagome and the others are in danger now!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; What?!</p>
<p>JKS takes the change and attacks INU, cutting his thigh.</p>
<p class="txt">JKS:&emsp;&ensp; Your opponent is me!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Shut up! Let's go, Shippo! (runs)</p>
<p class="txt">JKS:&emsp;&ensp; (retracts blades) I won't let you escape!</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; Go, horse!</p>
<p>SHI jumps off his horse. It crashes into JKS and a puff of smoke appears.</p>
<p class="txt">JKS:&emsp;&ensp; What?</p>
<p>The smoke dissipates to reveal JKS surrounded by tons of SHI's wailing mushrooms.</p>
<p class="txt">JKS:&emsp;&ensp; (incredulous) What's this? Hey! (shakes sword, yells) Wait up! Inuyasha!</p><br>
<p>Cut to MKS's hut. KAG is kneeling, with her hands placed nicely in front of her. She has the white cloth over her head like a wedding veil. MKS is holding her up.</p>
<p class="txt">MKS:&emsp;&ensp;(in girly tone) I may not be the best bride, please accept me. (changes to his own voice) That's okay. In celebration, you can dance for me.</p>
<p>MKS stands and holds up the limp KAG like a puppet. He takes her hand, waves it around and sings.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(thinking) What are his intentions?</p>
<p>A pink glow appears in MKS's neck.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(thinking) If I can take that Sacred Jewel fragment out of him…</p>
<p>MKS continues making KAG dance like a puppet and sings happily. He then lays her down, making her bow near the fireplace.</p>
<p class="txt">MKS:&emsp;&ensp;What a nice bride! A nice bride! Next, let's drink some sake.</p>
<p>Suddenly, KIR crashes through the roof with SAN and MIR on her back. They land and SAN rushes to KAG.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Kagome!</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Kagome…!</p>
<p class="txt">MKS:&emsp;&ensp;You're interfering with my Shuugen!</p>
<p>MKS opens a bamboo container and black fumes rush out. SAN steps in front of MIR and blocks with HIR.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Leave this to me! (taken aback)</p>
<p class="txt">MKS:&emsp;&ensp;(laughs) Your mask is of no use here. This poison will permeate through your skin and your eyes.</p>
<p>SAN collapses to the ground.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Sango!</p>
<p>MIR faints after a moment. KIR then rushes forward. MKS throws some poison fumes at KIR. She growls in pain, transforms back into her cute state and whimpers.</p>
<p class="txt">MKS:&emsp;&ensp;Not fun at all… Look, I'm not affected in anyway… Then again, I'm already used to it…</p>
<p>MKS suddenly freezes, shocked. KAG has suddenly regained some control of her body and has stabbed MKS in the neck with a pair of tongs from the fireplace. MKS whimpers and drops the container.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(panting, thinking) I did it…</p>
<p>MKS punches KAG and she falls to the ground.</p>
<p class="txt">MKS:&emsp;&ensp;Wretched girl! (pulls out tongs from neck)</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(thinking) No…!</p>
<p class="txt">MKS:&emsp;&ensp;(falls to his knees) You too? (cries) You tried to kill me because I look like this?!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;What are you talking about? You should ask yourself what you've done!</p>
<p class="txt">MKS:&emsp;&ensp;I won't forgive you! You hurt my feelings. I don't need a bride like you anymore. (strangles KAG's)</p>
<p>MIR and SAN look on helplessly.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; (thinking) Kagome… Damn it! My body won't move…</p>
<p class="txt">MKS:&emsp;&ensp;(strangles KAG violently) I'll just take the Sacred Jewel fragments.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(thinking) Inuyasha…</p>
<p class="txt">MKS:&emsp;&ensp;Die!!</p>
<p>Suddenly a green light appears behind MKS and he lets go of KAG. MKS whimpers and another light cuts through him. He collapses to the ground, whimpering in pain. SES appears behind MKS with raised claws.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(thinking) Sesshomaru… saved us…?</p>
<p class="txt">MKS:&emsp;&ensp;(thinking) What's this? I thought our enemies were only Inuyasha's gang and Koga's Wolf Demon Tribe.</p>
<p class="txt">SES:&emsp; Inuyasha isn't here?</p>
<p class="txt">MKS:&emsp;&ensp;Who the hell are you?</p>
<p class="txt">SES:&emsp; I should be asking you.</p>
<p class="txt">MKS:&emsp;&ensp;(sits up) You attacked me when you don't even know me?</p>
<p>MKS grabs his basket of poison and runs out of the hut. He takes two containers and throws the basket aside. He then faces the hut and wait. SES walks out slowly.</p>
<p class="txt">SES:&emsp; You can still move after my venomous claw?</p>
<p class="txt">MKS:&emsp;&ensp;(laughs) Take this!</p>
<p>MKS opens the containers and poison fumes rush out at SES. MKS laughs.</p>
<p class="txt">MKS:&emsp;&ensp;You'll get what you deserve!</p>
<p>The fumes dissipate to reveal SES still upright. He advances towards the horrified MKS.</p>
<p class="txt">MKS:&emsp;&ensp;Wait…! (falls next to a bush, trembling) Please wait… I was… I was wrong… Forgive me. Just don't take my life! (cowers into the bush) Don't take my life!</p>
<p>SES stops.</p>
<p class="txt">MKS:&emsp;&ensp;If I was really planning to go against you… (turns around with a big container in hand) I would do this.</p>
<p>Crimson fumes rush out at SES, who doesn't flinch.</p>
<p class="txt">MKS:&emsp;&ensp;What do you think? With this, it doesn't matter if you're a demon or not.</p>
<p>The fumes empty out. SES is still intact.</p>
<p class="txt">MKS:&emsp;&ensp;Why didn't he melt? This is the Great Lord Mukotsu's poison!</p>
<p>SES slashes MKS into two with Tokijin. MKS yells as his flesh rots away. MKS is reduced to a pile of bones.</p>
<p class="txt">SES:&emsp; A poison made by a human doesn't stand a chance against Sesshomaru.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (background) Kagome!</p>
<p>INU arrives at the scene with SHI on his shoulder.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Sesshomaru?!</p>
<p>INU looks around and gasps. INU and SHI rush into the hut.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Kagome!</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; Everyone has fainted.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (turns to SES) Bastard! What did you do to Kagome and the others?!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(weakly) No! Sesshomaru… saved us…</p>
<p class="txt">SES:&emsp; I didn't save you… I merely got rid of something which will hinder our talk. That's all.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; What talk?</p>
<p class="txt">SES:&emsp; Kohaku's scent is nearby. Is Naraku nearby too?</p>
<p>Pan sideways to reveal JKS hiding behind a tree. He looks at INU and SES's backview.</p>
<p class="txt">JKS:&emsp;&ensp; (thinking) Damn. That Inuyasha just ignored me. But, what's up with this spooky guy? We weren't told anything about him. However, he killed Mukotsu just like that.</p>
<p>A Poison Insect appears and takes the Sacred Jewel fragment from MKS's piles of bones.</p>
<p class="txt">JKS:&emsp;&ensp; (thinking) I better get going. (runs off)</p>
<p class="txt">SES:&emsp; Answer me, Inuyasha. Where is Naraku?</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; We haven't found him either. However, some zombies have been attacking us, and they have the fragments. There's no doubt that Naraku is nearby…!</p>
<p class="txt">SES:&emsp; That's all I needed to know. (turns around and walks)</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Sesshomaru!</p>
<p>INU looks at SES intently. Cut to SHI running around the group.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; Hang in there, Sango! (shakes MIR) Miroku, wake up! Miroku! It's the poison! They were poisoned!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (holds up KAG worriedly) Kagome!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;I'm alright… Miroku and Sango… protected me. There are herbs… in the medicine box… (loses consciousness)</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Kagome! Damn! If only I had been by your side.</p>

<p>Cut to temple. Charred bodies of dead monks are strewn across the courtyard. Inside one of the rooms, JKS is seated across the warrior/zombie from earlier on. He is dressed in the old monk's clothes.</p>
<p class="txt">Zombie: I see… So after Kyoukotsu, Mukotsu died as well?</p>
<p class="txt">JKS:&emsp;&ensp; Yeah.</p>
<p class="txt">Zombie: And? What sort of guy killed Mukotsu?</p>
<p class="txt">JKS:&emsp;&ensp; He has cold eyes… For a man, he's okay. But for me, I like the cuter ones like Inuyasha.</p>
<p class="txt">Zombie: Whoever asked about your taste in men?</p>
<p class="txt">JKS:&emsp;&ensp; But, Brother Renkotsu. Isn't there a lot of things we don't know about? Like this guy called Naraku who resurrected us… What in the world is he?</p>
<p class="ttable">The zombie, Renkotsu, abbreviated as RKS from now onwards.</p>
<p class="txt">RKS:&emsp;&ensp;About that…</p>
<p class="txt">JKS:&emsp;&ensp; Brother, have you met him?</p>
<p class="txt">RKS:&emsp;&ensp;The only person who has met Naraku is our eldest brother. Naraku gave him the Sacred Jewel fragments, including ours. The catch was to kill anyone following Naraku. And we could keep the Sacred Jewel fragments after that.</p>
<p class="txt">JKS:&emsp;&ensp; It's a promise, but two of our brothers are dead again. Now there's only four Shichinintai left.</p>
<p class="txt">RKS:&emsp;&ensp;If you take two away from seven, you get five.</p>
<p class="txt">JKS:&emsp;&ensp; Huh? (starts counting with fingers)</p>
<p class="txt">RKS:&emsp;&ensp;Anyway, Jakotsu, Inuyasha's people were all poisoned by Mukotsu, right?</p>
<p class="txt">JKS:&emsp;&ensp; Yeah, Mukotsu's poison is quite lethal. They won't live to see the sunset.</p><br>
<p>By a waterfall. SAN, MIR and KAG are lying unconscious on a large boulder. KIR, SHI and INU look at them worriedly.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; (holding a cup) They drank the antidote, but it'll only work if they get enough rest.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (very worried) We'll have to take them to somewhere safe then.</p><br>
<p>Back in the temple.</p>
<p class="txt">RKS:&emsp;&ensp;This is getting interesting. The truth is, Ginkotsu is heading towards Inuyasha right now. Our Ginkotsu is really quite a challenge for a demon.</p><br>
<p>Cut to forest. A large mechanical zombie trudges loudly through a forest.</p>
<p class="txtb">[ End of ACT III: 22min 5sec ]</p><br>

<p class="txtb">[ Preview for next episode ]</p>
<p class="txt">MYO:&emsp; Master Inuyasha! I was away for only a while, and Master Inuyasha has traveled this far! What the hell is Master Inuyasha doing so far north? Could they be… at the hot springs?</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Hot spring is good for… Poor circulation, stiff neck…and athlete's foot!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; How can you guys be relaxing now? Another demon has appeared! I'll destroy you!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Next on Inuyasha, &quot;<a href="ep105.htm">The Strange Unfolding Steel Weapon</a>&quot;. There's a Sacred Jewel fragment on his head… could this guy be one of the Shichinintai?!</p><br>
