Inuyasha's and Sesshomaru's father left a sword each, but Inuyasha inherited Tetsusaiga. This made Sesshomaru indignant. Inuyasha finally executed the Wind Scar! In one swing, he made Sesshomaru out of commission! Sesshomaru also used the Tenseiga for its healing abilities. Who exactly did he save? Next episode, 'True Master of the Famous Sword'!</p>
<p class="header"><a name="1"></a>'Adult Swim' Synopsis</p>
<p>Sesshomaru and Inuyasha clash in battle. Inuyasha nearly kills Sesshomaru with Tetsusaiga, but the healing powers of Tenseiga saves him. Inuyasha leaves the wounded Sesshomaru behind, who is found by a young girl from a nearby village. She tends to his injuries despite his rejections.</p>

Don’t stoop to accepting human aid when you’re on the verge of death.&quot;</i><br> In episode 19, Sesshomaru was referring to Kagome’s arrows, which interfered with his battle with Inuyasha. And it is in this same psyche that he refuses Rin’s food, the human girl in this episode, even though he was severely injured.</li>

<p class="txt">SES:&emsp;&nbsp; (holding a reptilian arm) This replacement arm can act as a shield against Tetsusaiga’s barrier.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;That’s a dragon’s claw! It’ll be far stronger than some demon’s arm. But what does he intend to do with it?</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Keh! I don’t give a damn if it’s a dragon’s claw! But just one thrust seems to have damaged it considerably!</p>
<p class="txt">SES:&emsp;&nbsp; (smirks) The Tetsusaiga is quite amazing. Even without its true bearer, a dragon’s claw is no match against it. However, why doesn’t it reveals its “Wind Scar” to the one it has allowed into its barrier? Tetsusaiga…cut through the empty space! Reveal your true power!</p>
<p class="txt">TOT:&emsp;&nbsp; Sesshomaru is able to see the “Wind Scar”!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Old man…just what is the “Wind Scar”?</p>
<p class="txt">TOT:&emsp;&nbsp; Simply put, the secret to mastering the Tetsusaiga. Slaying a hundred demons is impossible unless you read the “Wind Scar.” Sesshomaru is able to see it.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Then please teach the secret to Inuyasha, too! Right now!</p>
<p class="txt">TOT:&emsp;&nbsp; It’s impossible to teach. Inuyasha must discover it for himself. If he cannot, Inuyasha will die here.</p><br>
<p class="txtb">[ Title screen: The True Owner of the Great Sword! ]</p><br>
<p>SES attacks INU’s TET mercilessly. One of his claw attack sends INU backwards, the blade vibrating.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Damn it! He’s just using brute strength!</p>
<p>SES moves towards INU, clawing at the blade, each claw pushes INU backwards a little. SES gets more violent and INU is thrown onto the ground.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Inuyasha!</p>
<p>The blade vibrates vigorously, the vibration causing a ringing sound.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;The sound is crying!</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Do you think Sesshomaru is only aiming for the Tetsusaiga?</p>
<p class="txt">TOT:&emsp;&nbsp; This is bad! He’s hacking away at the peak of wave pattern of the sword! Even the Tetsusaiga will snap if it’s hit repeatedly like that.</p>
<p>SES continues hacking at the blade.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (thinking) What’s with him?! Sesshomaru is fighting with the Tetsusaiga!</p>
<p>SES’s attack sends INU back to the ground.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Inuyasha! (rushes forward with HIR ready)</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Stop! (SAN stops) Don’t interfere! I will kill Sesshomaru with the Tetsusaiga! (thinking) He intends to break the Tetsusaiga! As if I’d let him do that so easily!</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; (placing a hand on SAN’s shoulder) Inuyasha has been able to master the Tetsusaiga albeit one time. Even if it was coincidence, it still required the talent.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(thinking) But if he can’t use it right now, he’ll be killed! Inuyasha!</p>
<p class="txt">SES:&emsp;&nbsp; (stops attacking) Why don’t you roar, Tetsusaiga? Then you shall die with your master.</p>
<p>SES rushes towards to INU, grabs the TET with his dragon claw. He raises his other hand to punch the blade, but hits INU’s head instead. INU has swung TET out of the attack range and block SES’s attack on it with his head.</p>
<p class="txt">SES:&emsp;&nbsp; He protected his sword…!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (head bleeding) I haven’t broken in this sword yet and I’m not about to let it go!</p>
<p>SES’s fist on INU’s head emits poisonous gas and INU is flung backwards.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (rubbing his forehead) Damn! I can’t see! (SES leaps into the air emitting dark fumes around him) A miasma! (SES lands and claws at TET again) Demon aura, a vortex of demonic energy!</p>
<p>Huge purplish currents are swirling in the air.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; The smell of the wind scraping. The fissure where the flow of demonic energy collides! No! The smell of the wind…! (the currents start to spark) Is right here! (</p>
<p>INU slashes TET at the contact point between the currents which sparks. The slash causes a light to engulf SES and throws him backwards. His eyes glow red, and his armor is broken. Tenseiga starts to throb and emit a black light which engulfs SES. SES disappears with the light. The rest of INU-gang hides behind the seated three-eyed cow, to get out of impact.</p><br>
<p>There are long huge scars across the ground. SAN, MIR, SHI and KIR examine the scars, which originates from INU. INU is still standing in shock, heaving. He slouches and TET transforms.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Is it over?</p><br>
<p>INU-gang by a river.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (putting his hands into the river) So that was the “Wind Scar.” (drinks the water)</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;You did it, Inuyasha! That’s the secret to mastering the Tetsusaiga.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; (sitting on a rock with SAN and KIR) Did Sesshomaru die?</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Probably. He received a direct blow from the Tetsusaiga.</p>
<p class="txt">TOT:&emsp;&nbsp; (hitting the TET on a boulder with his hammer, periodically blowing flames at it) What direct blow? All he did was swing his sword around because his eyes were hurting from the poison.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Whaddya say, Ol’ Man?!</p>
<p class="txt">TOT:&emsp;&nbsp; Now listen. I will praise you for finally seeing the “Wind Scar.” However, all it means is that you can do what Sesshomaru can. Actually, he has become even more formidable.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; What do you mean?</p>
<p class="txt">TOT:&emsp;&nbsp; In that battle, Sesshomaru’s life was protected by the Tenseiga.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;The Tenseiga protected him?</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; Didn’t Sesshomaru die?</p>
<p class="txt">TOT:&emsp;&nbsp; Inuyasha, I’ll bet you didn’t sense your attack hit Sesshomaru, now did you?</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Is that true, Inuyasha?</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Yeah. His presence dispersed with the light emitted by the Tetsusaiga. I didn’t blow him away. It was more like he just suddenly vanished…</p>
<p><span class="txtb">Flashback</span> of the fight previously, where Tenseiga throbbed and emitted a light which shielded SES from INU’s attack.</p>
<p class="txt">TOT:&emsp;&nbsp; (voice-over) Amidst the light and power being released by the Tetsusaiga, the Tenseiga protected Sesshomaru. It acted on its own judgement.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(voice-over) Acted on its own?</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;(voice-over) The Tenseiga is the sword of healing, to save life. And Sesshomaru despised it.</p>
<p class="txtb">Cut back to present.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; However, when Sesshomaru’s life was endangered, without regard to its owner’s will, the Tenseiga saved Sesshomaru. That’s about it?</p>
<p class="txt">TOT:&emsp;&nbsp; So how will you defeat such a foe? I have no idea.</p><br>
<p>INU looks at the rusty TET. The gang is standing on a path. TOT is moving away on his cow.</p>
<p class="txt">TOT:&emsp;&nbsp; Well, I sharpened the sword. Now, you just have to keep training to be able to defeat Sesshomaru and Tenseiga. (thinking) Inuyasha and Sesshomaru were each given a sword by their father. Tenseiga and Tetsusaiga. This was their father’s way of telling the brothers not to fight each other. (turns back to look at the gang, saying) Oh well… They’ll learn in good time.</p>
<p class="txtb">[ End of ACT I: 8min 25sec ]</p><br>
<p class="txtb"><a name="_ACT_II_"></a>[ ACT II ]</p>
<p>Sun setting in a forest. SES lays dazed under a tree. His red eyes return to normal. Leaves rustle among the bushes. A little girl peeps at SES from behind a tree trunk. SES suddenly gets up and growls at the girl, his eyes blood red again. The little girl, frightened, gasps. She recovers and walks toward SES determinedly. SES sits up and glares at her.</p><br>
<p>Nighttime in the forest. A bamboo container has been placed near SES. SES looks at it expressionlessly. The little girl appears behind a tree trunk again and walks up to SES with some mushrooms and a fish. She places it near the bamboo container and leaves.</p>
<p class="txt">SES:&emsp;&nbsp; (in disinterest) Mind your own business. I don’t eat what humans eat.</p>
<p>The little girl stops and looks at SES.</p><br>
<p>In a quiet village pond, the little girl catches a fish. Suddenly some villagers appear with torches in their hands.</p>
<p class="txt">Villager 1: I knew it!</p>
<p class="txt">Villager 2: Rin! You’re the culprit!</p>
<p>Cut to villagers surrounding the little girl, kicking her.</p>
<p class="txt">Villager 1: You stole the fish from the fish preserve!</p>
<p class="txt">Villager 3: You’re an orphan, so the village took pity on you and raised you!</p>
<p class="txt">Villager 1: (holds up girl by her collar) If you try this again, we’ll beat you to death! (slaps the girl)</p>
<p>Cut to the little girl walking weakly away from the villagers.</p>
<p class="txt">Villager 2: Damn! What a creepy kid! Won’t even cry!</p>
<p class="txt">Villager 1: Can’t be helped. Her family was killed by brigands in front of her eyes and now she can’t speak.</p><br>
<p>Sun rising in the forest, where SES was resting. The little girl brings some vegetables to him.</p>
<p class="txt">SES:&emsp;&nbsp; (without looking at her) No thanks.</p>
<p>The girl runs up to him, kneels and offers the food.</p>
<p class="txt">SES:&emsp;&nbsp; I told you I don’t need anything.</p>
<p>Cut to front view of the girl putting the food down in disappointment. Her face is bruised and her right eye is unable to open.</p>
<p class="txt">SES:&emsp;&nbsp; What’s with those bruises on your face? (the girl looks at him) If you don’t want to talk, that’s fine.</p>
<p>The girl remains silent. SES turns to look at her, and she smiles happily.</p>
<p class="txt">SES:&emsp;&nbsp; What’re you smiling about? I only asked a question.</p><br>
<p>Cut to village. The little girl skips on one leg towards her house. When she reaches the hut, a one-eyed man is seen drinking out of a vat.</p>
<p class="txt">Man:&emsp;&ensp;What? Is this old hut yours?</p>
<p>The little girl nods, a little frightened of the man. In the background, people are crying ‘Wolves!’.</p>
<p class="txt">Man:&emsp;&ensp;(walking out) They’ve caught up already!</p>
<p>The man pushes the little girl aside and runs off. Cut to a pack of ferocious wolves running. They attack the villagers in their path. Cut to the man swimming away in a river next to the hut. Some wolves jumps in and attacks him. Back on land, a barefooted youngster in fur appears among the wolves. The man is dragged onto land by the wolves which jumped in after him.</p>
<p class="txt">Leader: I searched for you… You thief! (holds up the man’s head) Now hand over the Sacred Jewel fragment you stole.</p>
<p class="txt">Man:&emsp;&ensp;(reaching into his clothes) All right… I won’t run.</p>
<p>The man places a jewel fragment on the ground. The leader picks it up, chuckles and walks off.</p>
<p class="txt">Man:&emsp;&ensp;Thanks… You’re gonna lemme go?</p>
<p>The leader, hearing, stops and slashes him.</p>
<p class="txt">Leader: (raising blood-stained hand) Fool! I just forgot. (shakes blood off hand) All right! Work’s done. I’m going on ahead. (walks on) You can stay in the village and eat what you like.</p>
<p>The wolves scamper off, leaving the man dead. The little girl who witnessed this entire scene is frightened. Cut to wolves attacking villagers against a blood red backdrop.</p><br>
<p>INU-gang traveling along a path. KAG pauses suddenly.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;What’s the matter, Kagome? You’ve been so quiet.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Hmm… It’s very slight, but I can sense a Sacred Jewel fragment.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (turns back) Is that true, Kagome?! In which direction?</p><br>
<p>Cut to the little girl running through the forest. A pack of wolves are on her trail. As she is running, out of breath, an image of SES forms in front of her. The image of SES starts to turn away from her. The little girl is running with tears in her eyes. She trips over a root and the wolves pounce on her. She looks at them in terror.</p><br>
<p>Cut to JAK on SES’s two headed reptile, flying in the air.</p>
<p class="txt">JAK:&emsp;&ensp; (calling out) Lord Sesshomaru! Lord Sesshomaru! Please answer! Where are you?! Lord Sesshomaru! (to himself) Is it possible that Lord Sesshomaru was slain in one sweep by Inuyasha? In one sweep? Talk about one sweep…</p>
<p><span class="txtb">Flashback </span>of previous episode where SES and JAK were looking for a dragon claw in a swamp.</p>
<p class="txt">JAK:&emsp;&ensp; (voice-over) At that time, Lord Sesshomaru, without any hesitation, he drew his sword.</p>
<p>SES unsheathes Tenseiga and slashes at the unsuspecting JAK, who wanted to see its power.</p>
<p class="txt">JAK:&emsp;&ensp; (voice-over, agitated) In one sweep…! He mentioned that the Tenseiga was unable to kill, but could he really have been testing his sword on me?!</p>
<p><span class="txtb">End of flashback.</span> Cut to SES’s two head reptile resting on a meadow. JAK sits on it, plucking at a flower, petal by petal.</p>
<p class="txt">JAK:&emsp;&ensp; Testing his sword…Not…Testing his sword…Not…Testing his sword…Not… (only one petal is left on the flower) Testing his sword… (stares at the flower) He was testing his sword?! (stands up and shouts) Lord Sesshomaru! Would you have let me die that time?! Lord Sesshomaru!</p>
<p>A rock is flung towards JAK, knocking him off the reptile-horse. It awakes. SES approaches them.</p>
<p class="txt">JAK:&emsp;&ensp; Lord Sesshomaru! (leaps onto the reptile-horse to be at eye level with SES) Were you testing your sword on me?!</p>
<p class="txt">SES:&emsp;&nbsp; Weren’t you looking for me out of concern?</p>
<p class="txt">JAK:&emsp;&ensp; Err…well…Lord Sesshomaru, I’m so glad to see you well—(another rock hits him in the face)</p>
<p>A gust of wind blows. SES looks around.</p>
<p class="txt">JAK:&emsp;&ensp; (thinking) Blood…and the smell of wolves. (to himself) The smell of this blood…</p><br>
<p>SES walking in a dark forest. He stops when he finds the dead little girl, lying on the path.</p>
<p class="txt">JAK:&emsp;&ensp; (reaching SES) What is that? Oh… She’s a goner. (walks to the girl) Must have been attacked by wolves. She’s been bitten to death. Lord Sesshomaru, do you know this human?</p>
<p>Flashback of the girl smiling at SES. Back to present. SES clutches Tenseiga.</p>
<p class="txt">JAK:&emsp;&ensp; (taken aback) Lord Sesshomaru?</p>
<p>SES unsheathes Tenseiga. The blade throbs and glow.</p>
<p class="txt">SES:&emsp;&nbsp; I see… I can see them… (demons start to appear around the dead girl) They are from the netherworld? Should I try it…? The power of the Tenseiga.</p>
<p class="txt">JAK:&emsp;&ensp; T-test it? Lord Sesshomaru, what did you just say…?</p>
<p>SES slashes the demons with Tenseiga. They disintegrates. JAK looks on in astonishment. SES holds the girl up. He gasps when the girl’s heart starts to beat again. She opens her eyes.</p>
<p class="txt">JAK:&emsp;&ensp; She’s come back to life! Lord Sesshomaru…did you save that girl with the Tenseiga?</p>
<p>The girl stands up as SES releases her and walks off.</p>
<p class="txt">JAK:&emsp;&ensp; L-Lord… Sesshomaru… Lord Sesshomaru saved a human… I’m almost in shock… But didn’t he just say that he was testing it? T-then… did you really test that sword on me?! (starts to cry) Lord Sesshomaru! I am so sad! I am so sad! So sad is Jaken! (the little girl starts to follow SES) Lord Sesshomaru! You are so cruel! (stops crying and looks around to find that everyone is gone) Huh? (runs off to follow SES) Lord Sesshomaru, please wait!</p>
<p>Cut to SES waiting, with close-up on Tenseiga.</p>
<p class="txt">SES:&emsp;&nbsp; Hmm…Tenseiga, huh? It made me save a human.</p>

<p>INU-gang reaches the village devastated by the wolf pack.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; What is this?</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; Oi! Is anyone here?!</p>
<p>Cut to paw-prints on the ground.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;The work of a wolf pack?</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; These are wolf tracks.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; And many of them. Could this be from the Sacred Jewel fragment Kagome sensed?</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Probably. Demons have to be involved in this!</p>
<p>A pack of wolves appear and growls at INU-gang.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; (jumping into KAG’s arms) There! Man-eating wolves!</p>
<p>More wolves appear and surrounds the group.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Keh! Let’s have it out then! Without the pack, they’re helpless! I’ll get rid of you all!</p>
<p>INU slaughters the wolves effortlessly with both his sword and Iron-Reaver, Soul-Stealer. The remaining wolves run onto a mound and start howling.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; They’re howling!</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Calling their comrades!</p>
<p>The sound of howling is heard throughout the forest.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;I sense Sacred Jewel fragment coming closer! And very fast!</p>
<p>INU rushes in front of KAG. A whirlwind appears and swirls toward the group. The whirlwind dissipates to reveal the youngster in fur seen earlier on.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; A man emerged from the wind!</p>
<p>The wolves gather around the leader and yowls to him.</p>
<p class="txt">Leader: You… (three pink glow appears on him) Why did you kill my minions?</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(to herself) He…has Sacred Jewel fragments on his right arm and both legs.</p>
