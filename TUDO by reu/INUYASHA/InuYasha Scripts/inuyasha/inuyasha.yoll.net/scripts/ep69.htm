<ul><li><i>Bosozoku</i><br>       'Bosozoku' refers to a specific Japanese phenomenon of teenage bike gangs. These gangs are based in Japan’s major metropolises, such as Osaka and Tokyo, where they gather every weekend for mass rallies of bikers in thousands. The <i>Bosozoku</i> first formed in the 1950s at a time when the Hell's Angels in the United States reached their apogee with Marlon Brando in “The Wild Ones. They are also considered in Japan to be the first rung on the ladder for would-be members of the Yakuza — the Japanese equivalent of the Mafia. Opinions split on the <i>Borozoku</i>; some think they are a social problem, (contributing to the hike in violence among teenagers and deaths resulting from fights) others think they are just a healthy embodiment of youth and expression of freedom. {<span class="contri">Japan's Biker Gangs</span> &amp; <span class="contri">&quot;Bosozoku&quot; — Pressures of a Conformist Society</span>}</li>
<li><i> Musou's face-reading</i><br>A piece of trivia. Using physiognomy, the mole on the left cheek of Musou means he is 'studious and struggling.' <span class="contri">{Serena's Guide to Face Reading}</span> The interesting thing is, physiognomy studies the face, but a faceless character who changes his face, would mean a changing character everytime.</li></ul>

<p>FAC kneel by a river. A horse is tied around a tree nearby. FAC looks at his reflection in the water. It is the face of the bandit boss. FAC frowns, and tears the face off. He tries on another bandit face. He is not satisfied and throws it into the river. There are a lot of faces in the river. FAC sighs. A handsome monk and his disciple walk up to him.</p>
<p class="txt">Monk:	Are you the source of evil, spectre?</p>

<p>The monk hits the faceless man on the head with his staff.</p>
<p class="txt">Disciple: He did it!</p>
<p>FAC flexes his fingers and grabs the monk's face. He presses his face towards the monk's threateningly. The horse whinnies. The disciple cries in terror and runs off. Cut to FAC walking up to the river. He looks at his reflection, and now has the monk's face.</p>
<p class="txt">FAC:&emsp; (laughs) My face! I have a face!</p><br>

<p class="txt">FAC:&emsp; (chuckles) Yes, it's a fine sword, all right.</p>
<p class="txt">Warrior: (horrified) You! Just who are you?!</p>
<p>Cut to FAC riding away on a horse, in the warrior's clothes and with his sword, laughing.</p><br>
<p>FAC rides into a village. Cut to the fire bell ringing. The village is on fire. FAC slaughters the villagers viciously. He laughs as he kills.</p><br>
<p>FAC sits down on the grass, examining the loot he plundered from the village. He feels a length of silk, laughs, then sighs. Cut to FAC lying on his side, playing with a bag of jewels listlessly. Cut to FAC throwing a pot onto a rock, breaking it.</p>
<p class="txt">FAC:&emsp; Why?! It's not enough! (looks at his loot) I want more, more… What else…?</p><br>
<p>Cut to FAC riding up to a cliff, overlooking a village.</p>

<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(background) Inuyasha!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (gasps and turns back) Kagome!</p>
<p>Cut to KAG running towards the group happily with her big haversack.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Inuyasha!</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; Kagome!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Sorry I'm late!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (yells) Don't come, Kagome!</p>
<p class="txt">MSO:&emsp; (gasps) That woman…!</p>
<p>Cut to flashback of KIK tending to Onigumo in the cave. Cut to present.</p>
<p class="txt">MSO:&emsp; (shocked) What did I just feel?</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; He's an offshoot of Naraku. Stay back!</p>
<p>KAG agrees and stays with SHI a distance away.</p>
<p class="txt">MSO:&emsp; (gapes at KAG) Who is she…?</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Don't just stand there in a daze! Die!	(slashes off part of MSO's arm-whip)</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; He did it! It's working!</p>
<p class="txt">MSO:&emsp; (walking backwards) What is it? What is this?! Woman? (gasps) Yeah… It's that woman!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; What're you babbling about? I'll finish you off…! (sprints)</p>
<p>MSO's arm-whip suddenly grows back and hits INU aside.</p>
<p class="txt">MSO:&emsp; (yells) The woman! Move! Woman! (runs towards KAG)</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Why, you! (throws HIR at MSO who dodges)</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Damn it! (chases MSO)</p>
<p class="txt">MSO:&emsp; I got it! (stretches his whip towards KAG while running)</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (yells) Run!</p>
<p>KAG starts to run but MSO grabs her.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Kagome!</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Kagome!</p>
<p class="txt">MSO:&emsp; (raises KAG high up in the air, laughing) You're the one!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;W-Who is he? What does he want?!</p>
<p class="txt">MSO:&emsp; I've wanted this…woman! (laughs)</p>
<p>INU-gang looks on, worried.</p>

<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; What the hell?! This guy is obviously Naraku's detachment, but he doesn't know Naraku?!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Kagura suddenly appears and tell Inuyasha of Musou's whereabouts. He is in the cave where Kikyo hid Onigumo fifty years ago.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; This might be a trap! But we might be able to learn something if we go there.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;At this time, Naraku attempts to kill Kikyo…! Next on Inuyasha: &quot;<a href="ep70.htm">Onigumo's Memories Restored</a>&quot;.</p>
