The Higurashi shrine that I live in in the modern times is a very old one. Although I didn't really believe in Gramp's prayers and sutras, but after finding the Dry Well that links to the Feudal age, I'm beginning to think that unfathomable things happen in the shrine! The shrine used to perform exorcisms too. The sutra that seals a Noh mask caught fire, and the mask even attacked us! Next episode, 'Reborn in the Present, The Cursed Nou-men'!</p>
<p class="header"><a name="1"></a>'Adult Swim' Synopsis</p>
<p>After her encounter with the Thunder Brothers, Kagome is feeling homesick and ready to leave the chaos-bound medieval time that Inuyasha leaves in. So she decides to return home, but upon her arrival, she finds something terrible: one of her family temple storehouses is on fire!</p>

<ul><li>Noh-Mask:<br>A mask used in traditional Japanese plays. Noh is the oldest form of theatre in Japan. As opposed to Kabuki, which represents extroverted liveliness, Noh is calculated, slow and restrained (which probably explains why the Flesh-Eating Mask moves so slowly). As with Kabuki, all the performers are men. Masks are usually worn. More details can be found at <span class="contri">{Inuyasha-Companion}.</span></li>
<li>Katsura tree:<br>The mask was carved out of a katsura tree, which is a deciduous tree found in low mountainsides of China and Japan. Its dark blue-green candy-scented leaves turns from yellow to scarlet in autumn. The leaves, when freshly shred, gives off a scent, which some says smells like freshly baked cakes. The smell makes it possible for a human nose to locate the tree even in dense growth. {KatsuraC} It was a kind of laurel said to live on the moon and be visible in its dark spots. <span class="contri">{Mythological Giant Trees in Japan}</span></li></ul></td>

<p class="ttextb">Oddities</p>
<ul><li>Hojo, Ayumi, Eri and Yuki make their first appearances in this episode.</li>
<li>This is the only episode in which a Sacred Jewel fragment is found in modern Japan.</li>
<li>The voice actress for Eri, MASUDA Yuki, also did the voice for the child in episode 5.</li></ul>
<p class="ttextb">Difference from Manga</p>
<p>This episode is heavily edited from the original storyline in the manga. In the manga, a woman who received the mask as an heirloom brought it to the Higurashi shrine to be exorcised. The mask possesses her body but she was knocked down by a car. The mask then finds four teenagers and eats them (in the manga, the victims were eaten instead of turned into blobs). It gains a naked body from the teenagers’ flesh that is very slow. This story takes place between The Toad Who Would Be Prince (ep8) and the Thunder Brothers (ep9-10), which explains the absence of Shippo. The rest of the story plays out the same. <span class="contri">{TV Tome} </span></p>

<p class="txt">KAE:&emsp;&ensp;(narrating) Possession of the Sacred Jewel bestows tremendous power upon demons and others with evil in their hearts. My sister Kikyo had died trying to seal its powers. However, she was reincarnated as a young woman named Kagome and returned to this world. And now, the journey begins for Inuyasha, a half-demon with a human mother, and this young woman from the modern age.</p>

<p>Daytime, near the Dry Well in the feudal era. KAG appears on her bicycle, among the bushes. She looks around suspiciously.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(determined look) All right… Now! (pedals furiously towards the well)</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (suddenly appears and zooms in front of the well) Hold it, Kagome!</p>

<p>INU holds up a huge rock with both hands over the well. </p>

<p class="txt">Guy 2: Let’s go! (runs off)</p>

<p>Outside the Higurashi shrine, two fire engines and two police cars are parked. A huge crowd gathers. Policemen have formed a barrier to control the situation.</p>

<p class="txt">Fireman 5: (stands in front of the fire engine and waves his hands) Stop!</p>

<p class="txt">Newscaster: (voice-over) And next on the news… A runaway fire truck on the streets has been involved in many accidents. There appear to be several injured but that has not been confirmed at this time. It is unthinkable, but at every accident site people have disappeared. It is totally incomprehensible!</p>

<p class="txt">Mama: The doctor says he’s out of danger but Grandpa is still unconscious.</p>

<p class="txt">Mama: I don’t think we need to be overly concerned but he is getting on in age.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Mom, what’s all that? (points to the charms in Mama’s hands)</p>
<p class="txt">Mama: When they rescued him, he had these plastered all over his face. He had even stuffed some in his mouth.</p>

<p>Back to KAG’s room. The glass pane on the window starts shaking. Sota stares with wide eyes.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(thinking) Something’s different. Until now, everything was normal. So has something changed? (notices the container on her desk) This…! Is it because of the Sacred Jewel fragments?</p>
<p>KAG notices something and tilts her head to look.</p><br>
<p>Policemen have blocked a road with cars. They wave the batons in their hands and blow their whistles. The fire truck drives towards them and slows down. FEM suddenly burst out of the windscreen and breaks the windscreen of a police car, zooming at the driver. Its long black body meanders around, taking the bodies of all the people on the site. They try to escape but are absorbed into the body. FEM finally stops and its body have become much bigger. It trudges forward slowly.</p><br>
<p>In the hospital.</p>
<p class="txt">GRA:&emsp; (uttering) Watch out…for…the (wakes up suddenly and yells) The Flesh-Eating Mask!</p><br>
<p>The fire truck crashes through the fence of the Higurashi shrine. It crashes into the residential structure. The fire ladder is extended and crashes through the window of KAG’s room. KAG and SOT yells, and KAG holds SOT to the floor. FEM, on the ladder, reaches slowly for KAG’s desk.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;A Noh mask? The Flesh-Eating Mask that Gramps was mumbling about…</p>

<p>KAG runs out of the room, then returns to grab a stunned Sota.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Sota, don’t just stand there! (runs down the stairs) Run!</p>
<p>KAG and Sota run in the courtyard. KAG holds Sota’s hand while Buyo latches onto Sota’s back.</p>

<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Don’t cry! I just cut myself on the glass.</p>
<p>FEM turn the direction of the ladder and drop itself onto them. They dodge in time and sit on the floor. FEM recompose itself.</p>
<p class="txt">FEM:&emsp;&ensp;Give it to me… Give it to me…</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(noticing a glow in FEM’s forehead, thinking) It…has a Sacred Jewel fragment in its forehead! It’s after this bottle of fragments… Sota will be safer away from me.

<p class="txt">Sota:&emsp;What?! All by myself?!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Understand? Hurry!</p>
<p>FEM chases KAG as she runs down a slope. Sota runs to the Dry Well and peers into it. Buyo gets off his back, onto the mouth of the Well.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(voice-over) The well is linked to the Feudal States Era. Jump and throw yourself in.</p>

<p>Sota jumps in shrieking and crashes onto the ground.</p>
<p class="txt">Sota:&emsp;Owweee! I couldn’t go through! (panics) Why?!</p>
<p>Buyo licks himself, purring.</p>
<p class="txt">Sota:&emsp;Please…take me! (digs the ground with his hands, crying) I have to… or Sis will… Sis will die! (stops and wails)</p>

<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(blocking) Huh?! (falls backwards)</p>
<p class="txt">Sota:&emsp;Sis!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(thinking) If I don’t do something, the fragments will…! Sota, take this and run! (throws the container to Sota) Hurry!</p>
<p class="txt">Sota:&emsp;(nods) Yeah… (runs)</p>
<p>FEM chases Sota. </p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Sota, run!</p>
<p class="txt">Sota:&emsp;(trips and falls, the container falling out of his hand, thinking) That mask is after this bottle. I know! If I throw it away…! (shakes his head, grabs the container) No! (continues running) It can’t have this bottle!</p>
<p>Sota runs. He stops suddenly as he reached the edge of the building. He turns around and stare in stupefied horror at the oncoming FEM. Cut to INU breaking out of the body with TET and running towards Sota.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (leaps and swings TET) Listen! Don’t move!</p>
<p>INU slices FEM into two with one sweep of TET. It breaks into four pieces and disintegrates into thin air. The Scared Jewel piece in its forehead lands on the ground.</p>
<p class="txt">Sota:&emsp;You did it! You did it!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (swings TET over his shoulder) Yeah! Are the Sacred Jewel fragments safe?</p>
<p class="txt">Sota:&emsp;(nods with thankful tears) Uh-huh!</p>
<p>The sun started to rise.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Inuyasha…</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (turns around to face KAG against the soft rays) Kagome, not hurt?</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(gasps) Huh? (nods) No. (thinking) Huh… He’s sorta nice. What’s happening? It’s just a little… but Inuyasha seems sorta dashing. (notices the sun rising) Huh?! It’s morning?! (clasps her face and shrieks) Oh no! I have a test today! (turns around and runs off)</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Hey, Kagome!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Oh… See you, Inuyasha! Make sure you return to the other dimension! Sota! Pick up those fragments and bring them home! Inuyasha! Don’t take them! (disappears from the scene)</p>
<p>INU stares at KAG, stupefied. Sota stands up and tugs INU’s sleeves.</p>
<p class="txt">Sota:&emsp;Umm… (blushing) You were real cool!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Think so? (a oh-well-but-you-are-not-Kagome look)</p><br>
<p>KAG runs in her school uniform.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(looking at the book in her hand) Yup… Scout’s honor.</p>
<p>Fades to bird’s eye view of Tokyo.</p>

<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;I realized the Sacred Jewel fragment could be found in modern Japan too. Hence the search for the fragments has become harder! What?! Sota wants me to accompany him to visit his friend in the hospital? I can't tolerate Inuyasha, the big kid, anymore! I hope Sota won't create any trouble… But there, I met a lost child spirit. I will not let her soul be dragged to hell! Next episode, '<a href="ep12.htm">Tatarimokke and the Little Evil Spirit</a>'!</p><br></td>
