I realized the Sacred Jewel fragment could be found in modern Japan too. Hence the search for the fragments has become harder! What?! Sota wants me to accompany him to visit his friend in the hospital? I can't tolerate Inuyasha, the big kid, anymore! I hope Sota won't create any trouble… But there, I met a lost child spirit. I will not let her soul be dragged to hell! Next episode, 'Tatarimokke and the Little Evil Spirit'!</p>
<p class="header"><a name="1"></a>'Adult Swim' Synopsis</p>
<p>Inuyasha spots a ghost, called the Soul Piper, leading the souls of dead children with its tune. Wise Myoga, the flea, explains that when the Soul Piper’s eyes are closed, children are on their way to heaven. But should its eyes begin to open, a child is headed for somewhere far worse.</p>

<table width="100%"  border="0" cellpadding="10" class="chart"><tr><td><p class="ttextb">References</p>
<ul><li>Paper Cranes:<br>It is a tradition in Japan that if you fold ten thousand paper cranes, you can make a wish. It is also said to be a good luck charm for health.</li>
<li>I have a dream:<br>The quote in Kagome’s English textbook is part of the famous speech made by Martin Luther King, ‘I have a dream’, which speaks against the discrimination of black people in America. It is often quoted later as an appeal for freedom.</li></ul>
<p class="ttextb">Oddities</p>
<ul><li>Gramps has neuralgia?</li>
<li>This is one of the rare occasions that Ayumi is missing from the trio of Kagome’s friends.</li>
<li>Kagome learnt more about Mayu by accompanying Sota to the hospital. Yet at the end, Sota doesn’t appear anymore. The trigger to the story doesn’t appear to end it. Strange.</li></ul>
<p><b>Freeze Frame Fun</b></p>
<ul><li>Close up of Kagome’s English textbook: “I have a dream. One daymy five little children will not be judged by the color of their skin…” This is part of a speech which was made by King. He was a great leader who worked for the rights of black people. This speech was given in Washington, D.C. in 1963.</li>
<li>Ice-cream parlour: Cone or Cup--¥20, ¥50, ¥150, ¥80. Sundae--¥350, ¥460, ¥310. Blast, Shake, Smoothie, Float, Fall in Fla (cut-off)</li></ul>
<p><b>Comments</b></p>
<ul><li>It is interesting to note that when Shippo first appeared in this episode, he was in his pink flying blob form. And the Soul-Piper is a yellow blob. Yet Shippo goes, “A demon!” and was frightened.</li>
<li>It seems that Sota would appear when there’s a story about siblings. In this, it’s about the sibling rivalry between Satoru and Mayu. In episode 29, Sota also appears in the story between Sango and Kohaku.</li></ul>

<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Teacher told me to.</p>
<p class="txt">Eri:&emsp;&emsp; We’re used to it, but it’s a shock to hear that you need it, too. The high school Hojo is applying to is very difficult to get into.</p>
<p class="txt">Yuka:&emsp;What? Don’t tell me you’re seeing Hojo, Kagome?!</p>

<p>KAG, Yuka and Eri walk across a playground. Several kids and their mothers are playing with fireworks.</p>
<p class="txt">Yuka:&emsp;Oh, look! Fireworks! So pretty!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;It looks like fun! Huh?</p>
<p>The screen changes to saturated tones. A little girl, laughing mischievously, peeps out of a playground structure. She holds out a small firecracker. It lights up and spins towards the pile of firecrackers that the kids and their mothers had put on the ground. The entire pile crackles, startling everyone. The little girl gets on top of the structure and laughs.</p>
<p class="txt">Girl:&emsp;&emsp;Ha-ha-ha! Serves them right! (runs off)</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(angry) That girl! (chases the girl while Yuka and Eri look at her)</p>
<p>KAG reaches the girl further up.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Hold it! (the girl stops and turns around) What did you do that for?!</p>

<p class="txt">Girl:&emsp;&emsp;(slaps away KAG’s outreaching hand) None of your business!</p>
<p>KAG backs away and a ring of flames surround her suddenly. The girl looks at KAG defiantly and vanishes. The ring of flames becomes smaller and disappears too. KAG, shocked, falls on her knees. Eri and Yuka walk up behind.</p>

<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Jeepers! Why do I have to accompany you to visit YOUR friend in the hospital?!</p>

<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Oh, I’m sorry!</p>
<p class="txt">SAM:&emsp; That’s how Satoru…</p>
<p>Cut to SAT lying on his bed. Light glows from under the bed and a hand reaches out. It grabs the tube of a drip and pulls it down, shattering the drip.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(gasps, thinking) Huh?!</p>
<p>KAG notices the girl under the bed tugging at the drip tube</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;The girl at the park…!</p>
<p>The girl fades away.</p>

<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(thinking) Who is she anyway? I can’t ignore this.</p><br>
<p>Above the hospital, the girl floats in midair. A Soul-Piper blows his flute next to her.</p>
<p class="txt">Girl:&emsp;&emsp;Darn, foiled again!</p><br>
<p>KAG and Sota are walking along a road.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;You mentioned an evil spirit. What did you mean, Sota?</p>
<p class="txt">Sota:&emsp;I thought maybe an evil spirit was after Satoru… Satoru has been in a coma since the fire six months ago. At first, all my classmates when to visit him at the hospital. But weird things happened on their way home, like falling down the stairs, or barely missing getting hit by a car… After these things kept happening, the kids stayed away. In that fire six months ago, she died…Satoru’s older sister. Her name is Mayu.</p>
<p>KAG and Sota look up to a burnt apartment in a building, from the ground.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Is that the place?</p>
<p class="txt">Sota:&emsp;Uh-huh… Whenever they tried to clean up after the fire, an accident would happen. So it’s been like that for six months now.</p>
<p>Cut to balcony of burnt apartment. A pot of plant suddenly floats up and drops towards KAG and Sota.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Watch out!</p>
<p>KAG takes Sota and walk a few steps away. KAG covers Sota with her body. The pot crashed in front of them.</p>
<p class="txt">Sota:&emsp;I knew it! There is an evil spirit!? (faints)</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Sota! (shakes Sota and looks to the apartment) Huh?! Watch out!</p>
<p>The girl from before stands on the parapet of the balcony and jumps down. She lands in front of KAG.</p>
<p class="txt">Girl:&emsp;&emsp;Stupid! I’m already dead.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;You’re Mayu, aren’t you? Why do you do these things? Aren’t you Satoru’s sister?</p>
<p class="txt">Mayu:&ensp; Satoru, hah! I’ll kill him! Mom hated me! That’s why she abandoned me! She never wanted me!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Mayu… She seems so nice. Don’t make her unhappy anymore.</p>
<p class="txt">Mayu:&ensp; Be quiet! If you keep interfering, I’ll kill you, too!</p>
<p>Mayu disappears and the plants around KAG are uprooted from the soil. A tree is uprooted high up in the air too. KAG shields Sota while the plants crashes onto the ground around them. When the commotion stopped, KAG looked up. A flute tune is heard. KAG turns around to find the Soul Piper blowing her tune in front of her.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Huh? Until my eyes…are open…?</p>
<p class="txt">The Soul Piper disappears.</p>

<p class="txt">Mayu:&ensp; (floats outside the window in a goldfish kimono) I wanted to thank you before I left.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Such a pretty cotton kimono!</p>
<p class="txt">Mayu:&ensp; (smiles) Mom sewed it for me. Thanks for everything. Bye-bye! (flies upwards)</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(smiles, thinking) Mayu, you weren’t meant to be an evil spirit. You were just a little girl who loved her mother very much.</p>
<p>The tune of the Soul-Piper plays in the background. Mayu flies upwards and joins the Soul-Piper (with closed eyes). Mayu turns into a light and flies around it, laughing happily. They fade away.</p>

<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Half-demon Inuyasha is half demon and half human. His motive is to use the Sacred Jewel to turn into a full demon. In our journey for the Sacred Jewel, we met this girl who was attacked by demons, Nazuna. We decided to stay the night in an old shrine. Spider-head demons suddenly appeared in the shrine! Are all these a trap? Also, the moonless night reveals Inuyasha's secret! Next episode, '<a href="ep13.htm">The Mystery of the New Moon, the Black-Haired Inuyasha</a>'!</p><br></td>
