We met this girl that Miroku knew, Koharu. What..?! Miroku actually asked her to bear his child when she was just eleven?! He's such a pervert!! For Koharu's sake, we should leave this village as soon as possible! But the situation seems rather strange… villagers started attacking us! All these must be the doing of that female demon! Next episode, 'Kagura's Dance and Kanna's Mirror'!</p>
<p class="header"><a name="1"></a>'Adult Swim' Synopsis</p>
<p>Kagura is angered to learn that Naraku has been using her as a pawn, but she cannot seek revenge because Naraku holds her soul in his grasp. Meanwhile, our heroes encounter a runaway girl named Koharu. Naraku sends Kagura's older sister, Kanna, to attack the group, and Kanna uses a magical mirror to capture Koharu's soul.</p>

<p>Nighttime in a hut in a forest. KAG is tending to INU's wound, while the rest of the group sit around.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;So you're saying that this Kagura was born from Naraku?</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; I'm saying it's a possibility.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;But…</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; Naraku is a man. How can a man give birth to a woman?</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Naraku became one from a host of various monsters. What if one of them became separated from him?</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;I see… She didn't know enough about us to be Naraku in disguise.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; (closes his eyes) In any case, regardless of how a woman looks, if she's basically made from Naraku, I'm not interested.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;It's not like you're going to go out with her.</p>

<p><span class="txtb">Flashback </span>of previous episode.</p>
<p class="txt">KAR:&emsp;&nbsp; Fool! I can easily create wind!</p>
<p>KAR swings her fan and a wind vortex appears around herself. At the same time, INU also creates a wind vortex around himself. The wind vortexes slowly collide into each other. INU performs the Wind Scar.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Take that!</p>

<p class="txt">KAR:&emsp;&nbsp; The Wind Scar!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (voice-over) A woman with the same scent as Naraku. For sure, she had a spider-shaped burn scar on her back the same as Naraku.</p>
<p><span class="txtb">Back to present.</span> INU arrange his clothes after KAG finished tending to his wounds.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; But it's strange. For a woman, this Kagura was somewhat strong. If he can create someone like that…</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Uh-huh… Why didn't he do it earlier?</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; That's just it. It's not that he didn't choose not to do it…</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;He couldn't do it, until now.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Does that mean Naraku has gotten new powers?</p><br>
<p>In a new castle of NAR's. NAR sit in a room while KAR stands near him.</p>
<p class="txt">NAR:&emsp;&ensp;Kagura, because you took Tetsusaiga's blows, I was able to see the power of his sword. Go now. Once more.</p>
<p>KAR glares at him.</p>
<p class="txt">NAR:&emsp;&ensp;Already your older sister, Kanna, has been dispatched.</p>

<p>Daytime in a swamp. A group of workers search the swamp. An injured lord follow them on a horse.</p>
<p class="txt">Man 1: Damn! Where'd that bitch go? She resisted the Young Lord of the Keeper of the Oil.</p>

<p class="txt">Man 3: We found her!</p>

<p>Man 1 rushes forward and attack the figure with a bamboo in his hand. The figure turns out to be SAN, who dodges and knocks him on the head with a bamboo container. Man 1 falls back onto the water. KHR gasps. The lord and two other workers reach SAN and Man 1.</p>
<p class="txt">Lord:&ensp;&nbsp; W-who are you?!</p>

<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Wait! (slugs the three men and punches the lord in his face) So you're their leader?!</p>
<p>The lord falls off his horse onto the swamp water. The horse runs away. The three men rushes to the lord.</p>

<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Hope you understand, Miroku, we can't take that girl.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Yes…</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Still, we can't just abandon her.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Yes… Until I find someplace safe for her to stay, I cannot leave.</p>

<p>MIR sits KHR and they both kneel down.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Please understand, Koharu. (hugs KHR) When it comes time to battle, I'm not sure whether I'll be able to protect you. The demon I seek is that formidable. (hugs KHR tighter) It's hard for me to say goodbye, too.</p>
<p>KHR closes her eyes and bury her face into his arms.</p>
<p>Cut to the rest of the gang looking at MIR and KHR.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Is he trying to convince her?</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Seems more like he's seducing her.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Cripes, he's so touchy-feely! He's only making her more attached. (notices INU looking at her) What?</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; I may be imagining it, Sango, but you've been awfully prickly.</p>
<p>Sparks appear from SAN's eyes.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;(defensively) You're imagining it!</p>
<p>Fire emit around SAN. INU hides behind INU.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;S-sango…</p><br>
<p>Nighttime in the village. The group sends KHR to the headman and bid farewell.</p>
<p class="txt">KHR:&emsp;&ensp;Master Miroku, please stay with me for one night, at least.</p>
<p class="txt">Headman: You heard Koharu. Please stay the night.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; No… the longer we stay, the harder it will be on Koharu.</p>
<p>KHR starts to cry and runs into the house.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;What's wrong with staying one more night with her?</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Koharu is new to this village.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; I can't… If reason gives way to passion and Koharu gets with child, Koharu will be burdened for the rest of her life with my memory.</p>
<p>KAG and SAN gasp, move back and glare at MIR.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; (on KAG's shoulder) Reason gives way to passion? What does that mean, Miroku?</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Well… (goes up to SHI and holds up a finger happily)</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;You don't have to explain! Shippo is still a child!</p>

<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (reaches KHR) Listen! We'll be leaving the village after dawn. But remember, no tears tomorrow! Got that?</p>
<p class="txt">KHR:&emsp;&ensp;(gasps and smiles) Yes!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(smiling gladly at INU's gesture, thinking) Hmm…?</p><br>
<p>KHR throws some firewood into a fireplace outside a hut.</p>
<p class="txt">KHR:&emsp;&ensp;Master Miroku, how is the bath water?</p>
<p>Cut to inside, where MIR is having a bath.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Just right.</p>
<p>Cut to KHR.</p>
<p class="txt">KHR:&emsp;&ensp;I'll do my very best and prepare the finest meal for you!</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Hmm…I'm looking forward to it.</p>
<p>KHR gets up and trots off. The girl in white suddenly appears from behind a tree. She holds up her mirror and shines it at KHR. KHR's reflection is seen in the mirror. KHR gasps. Her soul flies out and is sucked into the mirror. KHR falls onto the ground. The girl in white looks at KHR expressionlessly.</p><br>
<p>The group is having dinner in the headman's house.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; The stewed vegetables are delicious!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Isn't it? How cute of Koharu. She outdid herself to please Miroku with her cooking.</p>
<p>INU picks up TET and looks back apprehensively.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Inuyasha?</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; (stops eating) We're surrounded.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Huh?</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; The meal Koharu painstakingly prepared will go cold.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Hmm…but it's strange. I don't smell any demons.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; In any case, let's go and check.</p>
<p>MIR and INU get up.</p><br>
<p>MIR and INU rush out of the house. A mob walk towards them from the distance, with torches and weapons in their hands.</p>
<p class="txt">Man 1: Kill them!</p>
<p class="txt">Man 2: Don't let them leave the village!</p>
<p class="txt">Man 3: Beat them to death!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; What's with these guys?</p>
<p>KIR runs out of the house and reaches MIR and INU. She growls. The men raise their weapons and surround them.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Are they from the village?</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Are they being mind-controlled?</p>
<p class="txt">Man 1: Kill them!</p>
<p>The mob rush towards INU and MIR.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Why you…! (jumps and punches the men)</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; (shoving a man away with his staff) Inuyasha, they're mortals! (knocks another man)</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; I already know that! (kicks another man in the butt)</p>
<p>INU, MIR and KIR fend off the men's attacks. Cut to interior of house, where SHI, KAG and SAN peep from the door.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; What's going on anyway?!</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;So many of them. I'd better go, too.</p>
<p class="txt">KHR:&emsp;&ensp;(opens a door and rushes in) It's terrible!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;What's the matter, Koharu?</p>
<p class="txt">KHR:&emsp;&ensp;A demon appeared and the headman and the others…!</p>
<p>SAN picks up her HIR and KAG gets her bow and arrows. The four of them walk further into the house apprehensively. They reach a room where the headman and his wife lie unconsciously on the ground.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; What's this?!</p>
<p class="txt">KHR:&emsp;&ensp;Headman!</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;A demon did this?</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Koharu! What kind of demon was it?</p>
<p class="txt">KHR:&emsp;&ensp;Well…I just got a glimpse of it…</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(thinking) But why? Inuyasha didn't catch any scent of demon.</p>
<p>SAN opens the door to another room. The girl in white appears.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Is that it? (prepares to attack but the girl fades away) Disappeared!</p>
<p>They glance around the room. The girl suddenly appears behind them and fades away when they notice her. She appears again and SAN attacks immediately.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Hiraikotsu!</p>
<p>HIR fly towards the girl. She tilts her mirror which forms a barrier around her and reflects HIR back at SAN. SAN is hit and lets out a yell, falling backwards. SHI tries to help but could not make it in time.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Sango! Shippo! (rushes to SAN) Sango, are you all right?</p>
<p class="txt">Girl:&emsp;&emsp;(softly) Kagome…</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(thinking) This girl is the demon?</p>
<p>KHR suddenly runs behind KAG and grabs her arms, making her unable to move.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Koharu, what's the matter?</p>
<p>The girl tilts her mirror, which shows KAG's reflection.</p>
<p class="txt">Girl:&emsp;&emsp;(softly) I want your soul.</p>
<p>KAG gasps. Her soul flies out and is sucked into the mirror.</p><br>
<p>Cut to MIR and INU running away from the mob. They punch the men.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Inuyasha, hold back! The villagers are being controlled! Do not hurt them!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; I know that!! Still…it'll never end like this!</p>
<p>KAR suddenly appears on a rock behind the mob.</p>
<p class="txt">KAR:&emsp;&nbsp; You guys are so dense. Why don't you just kill them all? So that they'll never get up again.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Kagura!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Not you again!</p>
<p class="txt">KAR:&emsp;&nbsp; Ha! I guess if you could kill them, you'd already have done it.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; So you were the one controlling the villagers!</p>
<p class="txt">KAR:&emsp;&nbsp; Yes, it was me. Humans without souls are as good as dead.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Without souls?</p>
<p class="txt">KAR:&emsp;&nbsp; Why around now, even that Kagome is having her soul sucked out.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; What?!</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Does that mean there's another demon?!</p>
<p class="txt">KAR:&emsp;&nbsp; (opens her fan) Now then, unsheathe that Tetsusaiga, Inuyasha. This time it won't end like the last time.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (worried, thinking) Kagome…</p>
<p class="txt">KAR:&emsp;&nbsp; What's the matter, Inuyasha? Got cold feet?</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Miroku, go back to Kagome and the others.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Inuyasha, what about you?</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Isn't it obvious? (unsheathes TET) I'm gonna get rid of this wench!</p>
<p class="txt">KAR:&emsp;&nbsp; (laughs and sends wind blades at them) Dance of the Wind Swords!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (blocking the wind blades with TET) Go, Miroku!</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; All right! (turns back and runs off)</p>
<p class="txt">KAR:&emsp;&nbsp; It's too late!</p>
<p>MIR runs but is faced with a mob further up. KIR appears and kicks them out off the way.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Kirara!</p><br>
<p>MIR reaches the house. KHR lies unconscious on the ground.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Koharu! Koharu, brace up! (holds up KHR) Koharu!</p>
<p class="txt">KHR:&emsp;&ensp;(wakes) Master Miroku, I was so scared!</p>
