<ul><li>Kagome is so freaky when she's furious that when she stormed up to Kawaramaru, the clay soldiers pointed their spears at her apprehensively. (see image)</li>
<li>The Voice Actress for Enju also did the voice for Nazuna in episode 13.</li></ul>
<p class="ttextb">Comments</p>
<ul><li>Kikyo's wish for Enju to live is probably because they are the same: made from ashes and bones and without warmth. Kikyo's reason to live on is to kill Naraku, and perhaps to be with Inuyasha. But being a priestess, she should have some guilt in taking the souls of humans to sustain herself. Perhaps if Enju desires to live for herself, Kikyo would be able to find an appropriate reason to live too. </li></ul></td>

<p>Flashback from episode 1, when KIK pinned INU to the Sacred Tree.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(narrating) 50 years ago, falling into Naraku's trap, Inuyasha and Kikyo killed each other.</p>
<p>Flashback from episode 14, when KIK was resurrected by Urasue.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(narrating) I released Inuyasha from the curse, and Kikyo was also resurrected by the witch, Urasue.</p>
<p>Cut to INU-gang traveling from episode 67.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(narrating) I don't think that demon are unable to understand human feelings. Because Shippo and Kirara can communicate with us.</p>
<p>Cut to KIK and KAG's meeting in episode 23.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(narrating) But, we can't understand Kikyo's pain after being resurrected.</p>

<p>Nighttime. KIK walks up to the edge of a lake. The soul collectors are flying in the sky, carrying souls. KIK notices a young woman, all battered and injured, lying unconscious on the ground nearby.</p>
<p class="txt">KIK:&emsp;&ensp; (thinking) That girl…</p>
<p>KIK raises her hand and a soul collector drops a soul onto the young woman. A blue glow surrounds her and she wakes and sees the soul collectors in the sky.</p>
<p class="txt">Girl:&emsp;&ensp;&nbsp;(thinking) Soul Collectors… Why am I here? (gets up weakly) It's another nosy-parker…</p>
<p>Another Soul Collector drops a soul onto the girl.</p>
<p class="txt">Girl:&emsp;&ensp;&nbsp;(agitated) I don't need it! Leave me alone!</p>
<p>The girl waves the Soul Collector away, which flies to KIK. The girl notices KIK.</p>
<p class="txt">KIK:&emsp;&ensp; You wanted to die? Or… do you wanted to remain dead?</p>
<p class="txt">Girl:&emsp;&ensp;&nbsp;You… (shocked) You're Kikyo?</p>
<p class="txt">KIK:&emsp;&ensp; You know me?</p>
<p class="txt">Girl:&emsp;&ensp;&nbsp;(furious) Just as I thought.</p>
<p>Fiery flames surround her and rushes to KIK. KIK merely closes her eyes. When she opened them again, the girl is already gone.</p>
<p class="txt">KIK:&emsp;&ensp; (thinking, sadly) She's also Urasue's… so there's someone of the same fate as me.</p><br>
<p>A huge army gathers in front of a castle. The guards in the castle fire arrows at the army, but the soldiers just continue advancing. The army seem to consist of clay soldiers. The leader of the army, riding on a horse, rides forth and raises his sword. He yells and the sword is engulfed with flames. The castle gate explodes and the guards are thrown in the air.</p>
<p class="txt">Leader: Fight! You lifeless figurines! Fill this world with carnage…!</p>
<p class="txt">The clay soldiers advance forward. The castle guards rush forth and attack the soldiers with their weapons. The soldiers remain intact as the weapons are broken. The soldiers then attack the guards. Cut to the castle burning and the leader laughing.</p>
<p class="txt">Leader: Look, mother! I, Kawaramaru, will fill this world with corpses!</p>
<p class="ttable">* The leader, Kawaramaru, abbreviated as KAW from now onwards *</p><br>
<p>INU-gang is in a forest-clearing, sleeping around a campfire. INU wakes and sniffs the air.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; What's wrong, Inuyasha?</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; There's no mistake. I can smell medical herbs.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Medical herbs?</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (stands) This is the smell of the medical herbs used by Urasue, the witch who resurrected Kikyo!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(wakes, rubbing her eyes) Urasue…?</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Although it's hard to believe… Everyone, wait here! (runs off)</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Inuyasha!</p><br>
<p>Cut to KAG and SHI on her bicycle, and MIR and SAN on KIR, chasing INU.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Didn't he tell us to wait?</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;He must have discovered something!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;During that time when Kikyo was resurrected, Urasue had died.</p>
<p>Cut to flashback from episode 15, when Urasue was killed by KIK. KIK walks unsteadily up to Urasue and puts her hands on her shoulders. Suddenly a current charges out of KIK's hands and shocks Urasue. Urasue falls backwards and spins, yelling in pain. She drops to the ground and is reduced to a burning mess. Cut to present.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(thinking) But why…?</p><br>
<p>The girl from earlier on is crossing a river unsteadily. She reaches the riverbank and walks through a forest. She stops for a while, panting weakly. Suddenly, clay soldiers appear behind her.</p>
<p class="txt">Girl:&emsp;&ensp;&nbsp;You! Why did you come here?</p>
<p>A clay soldier flies in front of the girl and grabs her hands.</p>
<p class="txt">Girl:&emsp;&ensp;&nbsp;What are you doing? Leave me alone!</p>
<p>The soldier pulls her along.</p>
<p class="txt">Girl:&emsp;&ensp;&nbsp;(struggling) No! I won't go back! (hits the soldier) Let me go!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (background) You bastard! Iron Reaver, Soul Stealer!</p>
<p>INU suddenly leaps out and claws the soldiers into pieces. Souls then raise out of the hollow soldiers.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Just as I thought… You're Urasue's soldier, aren't you?</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(background) Inuyasha!</p>
<p>The rest of INU-gang come running.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Inuyasha!</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; Are you all right?</p>
<p>INU grunts.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;This…?! Look, Miroku!</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; (surprised) These are clay figurines made from human bones and ash.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;But, why are they here?</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; I don't know, perhaps they're after that girl.</p>
<p>INU leaps to the girl who has fainted on the ground. SHI and KAG run to her as well.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; Is she alive?</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;The smell of herbs… (gasps)</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; It's the smell of Urasue's medical herbs.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;What on earth is this?</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; This girl… like Kikyo… was resurrected by Urasue.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Like Kikyo… She's dead?</p>

<p>Daytime in a deserted shrine. SAN, SHI and KAG are seated in a hall. The girl rests on KIR.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(narrating) It happened pretty soon after I began my journey with Inuyasha.</p>
<p><span class="txtb">FLASHBACK:</span> Cut to flashback from episode 14 when Urasue grabbed KAG on the bridge.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(narrating) I was captured by Urasue, who had stolen Kikyo's bones.</p>
<p class="txt">Urasue: You are needed to resurrect Kikyo!</p>
<p>Cut to flashback from episode 15, when KAG was put into a medicinal bath outside Urasue's kiln.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(narrating) I was put in a pungent medicinal bath. I felt terribly bad that time.</p>
<p>Cut to Urasue putting a branch of leaves on a clay mould. The mould breaks and KIK rises out of it.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(narrating) Urasue was a witch who had the ability to bring the dead back to life, she was trying to extract Kikyo's reincarnated soul from my body.</p>
<p>Cut to KIK revived. She walks to Urasue and kills her.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(narrating) In the end, Urasue brought Kikyo back to life, but she was killed by the resurrected Kikyo.</p>
<p class="txtb">END OF FLASHBACK.</p><br>
<p>INU and MIR are at a peaceful lake.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; We traced the smell to this place, but there's nothing.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (picks up some soil) I don't think so. Kikyo's smell still lingers here.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Kikyo's smell…?</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Yeah, but she doesn't seem to be nearby. (throws the soil into the water)</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Recently, an arm of soldiers has been destroying fortresses nearby.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Keh! I'm not interested in human disputes.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Those might be the doings of a demon too. Swords can't kill them, not even spears can pierce them.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; So those are Urasue's soldiers?</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; There is no doubt that someone had resurrected the clay figurines.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (gasps) Could it be Kikyo… who is manipulating the soldiers?</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; I'm not sure. But, it's certain that when we traced that girl's footsteps, we came across Kikyo's scent.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Damn it! What's going on?! (leaps off)</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Inuyasha! Where are you going?</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (leaping away) Isn't it obvious?! I'm going to deal with the one who is manipulating the clay figurines!</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; (sighs, thinking) When there's anything involving Kikyo, he always get hot-headed.</p><br>
<p>Back at the shrine. KAG, SHI and SAN are having tea in the courtyard. The girl walks out weakly.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(glade) You're awake! Are you alright now?</p>
<p>The girl falls to her knees weakly, panting.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(rushes to the girl and holds her up) Don't force yourself. Take a good rest.</p>
<p class="txt">Girl:&emsp;&ensp;&nbsp;(agitated) It's those nosy-parker… The Soul Collectors last night…</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Soul Collectors…?</p>
<p class="txt">Girl:&emsp;&ensp;&nbsp;Why did they keep pestering me?</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Soul Collectors… you met Kikyo?!</p>
<p class="txt">Girl:&emsp;&ensp;&nbsp;So she was Kikyo. I was wondering where she'd gone after killing my mother.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;(surprised) Your… mother?</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;What's going on?</p><br>
<p>In a castle. A large army of clay figurines gather in the courtyard. INU observes them from a tree.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (thinking) The clay figurines are here… Could the one who is manipulating them be here as well?</p><br>
<p>Cut to inside of castle. KAW, the leader of the clay soldiers, is pointing at a map on with a stick. A group retainers sit across him.</p>
<p class="txt">KAW:&emsp; We'll attack this fortress next. Its defense is quite formidable.</p>
<p class="txt">Retainer 1: But, nobody can withstand our army.</p>
<p class="txt">Retainer 2: Our dream will come true soon.</p>
<p class="txt">Retainer 3:  Thanks to your efforts, my lord.</p>
<p class="txt">KAW:&emsp;  You should thank the clay figurines created by me and Enju. (laughs and suddenly stops, noticing something)</p><br>
<p>Cut to INU landing on a rooftop in the castle.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (thinking) Where's Kikyo? (leaps down and looks around, thinking) I can't feel her presence anywhere.</p>
<p>A light appears in front of INU and KAE appears.</p>
<p class="txt">KAW:&emsp; What are you doing here?</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (thinking) So it's not Kikyo… (to KAW) It's you…you're the one who has been waging battle using clay figurines! You reek of the dead.</p>
<p class="txt">KAW:&emsp; My name is Kawaramaru. I am Urasue's son.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Urasue's son?!</p>
<p class="txt">KAW:&emsp; You're the one who was with the priestess who killed my mother? You showed up!</p>
<p>A group of clay soldiers surround INU and point their spears at him.</p>
<p class="txt">KAW:&emsp; I've assembled this army to attack neighboring states, but I'll deal with you first. (raises a hand) Turn that brat into ashes!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; You underestimate me! (rushes at the soldiers) Take this! Iron Reaver, Soul Stealer!</p>
<p>INU claws at the soldiers which break into pieces. Gas rushes out of the hollow soldiers and engulf the area.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (covering his nose with a sleeve) You've infused the human bones with poisonous fumes?</p>
<p class="txt">KAW:&emsp; It'll melt your skin and flesh, and your bones shall be my slaves!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (walks, suffocating) I can't open my eyes…</p>
<p>Two soldiers rush forth and point their spears at INU.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (breaks the spear) Damn it!</p>
<p>The soldiers then throw their spears, but miss. INU then unsheathes TET and slashes some soldiers into two. He then runs forth and leaps.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Wind Scar!</p>
<p>INU throws a Wind Scar and destroys several buildings. A short while later, KAW walks out from the wreckage and looks around.</p>
<p class="txt">KAW:&emsp; (smiles) He's escaped.</p><br>
<p>Back at the shrine. KAG, SAN and SHI are talking to the girl. KAG holds a piece of broken clay in her hands.</p>
<p class="txt">Girl:&emsp;&ensp;&nbsp;This is the fragment from the figurines I made upon Kawaramaru's orders.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Kawaramaru?</p>
<p class="txt">Girl:&emsp;&ensp;&nbsp;I'm Enju. (looks down) Kawaramaru and me were resurrected by Urasue, and became her servant. We are her children.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;So that's Urasue's spells?</p>
<p class="txt">Enju:&emsp; Kawaramaru is a warrior who was killed by his followers. Upon resurrection, the spell to manipulate the clay figurines were passed to him. I was ceramics artisan before I died.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Granny Kaede had told me before, that the reason Urasue resurrected the dead was to take advantage of their skills.</p>
<p><span class="txtb">FLASHBACK: </span>Urasue and Enju stand over two clay moulds.</p>
<p class="txt">Enju:&emsp; (voice-over) Urasue wanted me to make the clay figurines.</p>
<p>Cut to KIK rising out of a mould.</p>
<p class="txt">Enju:&emsp; (voice-over) She intended to have that priestess look for the Sacred Jewel fragments.</p>
<p>Cut to Urasue killed by KIK. Enju peeps at the scene from behind a boulder.</p>
<p class="txt">Enju:&emsp; (voice-over) But… Urasue was killed.</p>
<p>Cut to KAW talking to Enju, with an army of clay soldiers behind him.</p>
<p class="txt">Enju:&emsp; (voice-over) Kawaramaru then ordered me to make the clay figurines. I've had enough of helping him kill…!</p>
<p class="txtb">END OF FLASHBACK.</p>
<p class="txt">Enju:&emsp; (looks down sadly) But Kawaramaru would bring me souls when I couldn't move… Even when I didn't care…even when I wanted to rest peacefully…</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; (background) Is that why you ran away?</p>
<p>Enju gasps as MIR look at her.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Even though you're a dead person, you are beautiful.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(chiding) Miroku!</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; You said you want to rest in peace. But why don't you treasure the life that has brought back to you? (looks at a Buddha statue in the shrine) See, the reason why Buddha smiles is because the Buddha treasures life.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(impressed) Miroku…</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;(impressed) Priest, you're pretty impressive.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; (unimpressed, with folded arms, squinting) You got it wrong, Sango, Kagome. I'm not fooled.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Well, I don't think they're planning to let you go.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a group of clay soldiers appear.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Pursuers?!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(grabs her bow and arrows) Shippo, Kirara! Protect Enju!</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; Leave it to us! We won't let them touch her!</p>
<p>The soldiers advance towards them.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Stop, or I'll shoot!</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; It's useless to speak with lifeless clay figurines! (leaps and attacks the soldiers with his staff)</p>
<p class="txt">Enju:&emsp; (surprised) He shattered my figurines!</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; Miroku may be a monk who likes girls, but he also has supernatural power!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(shoots a sacred arrow destroying some soldiers) Enju! We'll destroy the figurines!</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;(breaks some soldiers with HIR) I'm sure they don't want to battle after their death!</p>
<p>MIR leaps and destroys a group of soldiers. Souls rise out of them.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; (praying) Go back to the earth and rest peacefully.</p>
<p class="txt">Enju:&emsp; (shakes head) It's impossible… Kawaramaru has more than 10 times of the soldiers under his command. Besides…</p>
<p>The group hears some noise.</p><br>
<p>Cut to the group reaching the edge of the shrine grounds with overlooks a plain. A large army of soldiers are crossing the plain.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; That's…!</p>
<p class="txt">Enju:&emsp; Kawaramaru's army. I wonder if they are going to attack another fortress.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; It's amazing…!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(resolute) But, we must destroy them! (to Enju) So, please promise me… If we win, you must stay alive.</p>
<p class="txt">Enju:&emsp; (thinking) Why is she so good to me?</p><br>
<p>Cut to KAW riding with the army.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (background) Wait a minute!</p>
<p>INU appears and runs towards KAW. KAW smirks. INU leaps and claws at some soldiers.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Iron Reaver, Soul Stealer!</p>
<p>The soldier let out a groan as they fall. MIR runs up to INU.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Inuyasha! (looks at KAW) That man… the one is the blue armor, is the leader?</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Yes. As long as we get him…</p>
<p>More soldiers attack them. MIR hits them with his staff.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; There are too many of them. I should use my Wind Tunnel.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (worried) Don't, Miroku! There are poisonous fumes in the figurines! If you're not careful, you might get poisoned!</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Well then… (throws some charms) Take that!</p>
<p>The charms hit some soldiers and they fall. Cut to INU fighting the soldiers.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Go to hell! (jumps) Blades of Blood! (slashes some soldiers)</p>
<p class="txt">KAW:&emsp; What a useless struggle.</p>
<p>KAW is taken aback as he sees the rest of INU-gang running to the scene.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Inuyasha!</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Priest!</p>
<p>KAG shoots an arrow and breaks some soldiers. Poisonous fumes rush out of them and engulf the area.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; You idiot! Look what you've done! Run, Kagome!</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Sango, you too! The figurines are releasing poisonous fumes!</p>
<p>KIR lands with SHI and Enju on her back.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Kirara! Protect Kagome!</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; (jumps off KIR) Leave it to me! Transform!</p>
<p>SHI transforms into his pink flying form and carries KAG over to MIR and INU. KIR then lands next to them with Enju and SAN on her back.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (chiding) We were fighting so cautiously, how could you be so careless?</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(apologetic) Sorry…</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; By the way, the dead person that Sango brought along is the girl we met?</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Yes. She was the one making the clay figurines, but she ran away.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; She doesn't want to make figurines to kill people.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Even if she's been making them all along, now she doesn't want to? It's too good of a story. (points TET at Enhu)</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Inuyasha!</p>
<p class="txt">Enju:&emsp; Kill me. It's my intention from the beginning.</p>
<p>INU scoffs and lowers TET. Enju walks to KAW.</p>
<p class="txt">Enju:&emsp; That's why I ran from you.</p>
<p class="txt">KAW:&emsp; Enju.</p>
<p class="txt">Enju:&emsp; We were once all dead. There's no place in this world for us!</p>
<p class="txt">KAW:&emsp; (scoffs) What nonsense! Why were we resurrected into this world then? Were we only resurrected for our mother's entertainment? Why won't you help me, Enju? Only when we wipe out the living, can your soul be comforted!</p>
<p>Enju looks at KAW sadly. KAG clenches her fists in anger and storms up to KAW.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(fierce) You don't even understand why Enju wanted to die! (puts her hands on Enju's shoulder) It's because she didn't want you to keep on killing!</p>
<p class="txt">KAW:&emsp; Living humans can't understand how we feel!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Damn it! (points TET at KAW) An idiot like him will never change!</p>
<p class="txt">KAW:&emsp; Whatever! We've come back to life, we'll do as we please!</p>
<p>KAW suddenly rides pasting INU and stops on a knoll. He then points his sword in at the dark clouds above.</p>
<p class="txt">KAW:&emsp; Erupt from the earth, Demon of Hell…!!!</p>
<p>Lightning rushes from the clouds and strikes KAW. The ground around him crumbles and a huge demon soldier rises out of it, growling. INU-gang gasps.</p>
<p class="txt">KAW:&emsp; (on the demon's shoulder, laughing) You who have returned with my mother's spells, kill them all!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (sprints forward) Begone!</p>
<p>The Demon of Hell growls and slams a hand on INU, who leaps and dodges. He slashes the demon's arm and poison fumes rush out. INU is thrown back by the fumes but the demon grabs INU.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Inuyasha!</p>
<p class="txt">KAW:&emsp; I'll have him crush you with a finger!</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; I'll use Wind Tunnel! Try to stay away!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Stand back, Miroku! This demon is mine!</p>
<p>Clay soldiers advance towards the group.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Get back!</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Kagome!</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; (holds Enju) Enju.</p>
<p>The group runs aside. KAW laughs hysterically.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; You bastard! You toyed with human souls! Take that…!</p>
<p>INU throws a Wind Scar from the Demon's hand. It hits the rest of the demon's body, KAW and the clay soldiers. A loud explosion ensues. Cut to the smoke clearing away.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Wind Scar's pressure swept away the poisonous fumes and Kawaramaru…</p>
<p class="txt">Enju:&emsp; Kawaramaru…</p>
<p class="txtb">[ End of ACT II: 21min 1sec ]</p><br>
