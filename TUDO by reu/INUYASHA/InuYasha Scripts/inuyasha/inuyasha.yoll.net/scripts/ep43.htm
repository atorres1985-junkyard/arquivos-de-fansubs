Kikyo actually handed over the Sacred Jewel that she snatched from me to Naraku…! Naraku's has since increased his powers and is able to form detachments which continuously attacks Inuyasha. This time round, it's Goshinki, the psychic demon! Oh no…! Inuyasha lost…?! Suddenly he reeks of evil aura… Inuyasha… what's wrong with you…? Next episode, 'The Tetsusaiga is Broken!'</p>
<p class="header"><a name="1"></a>'Adult Swim' Synopsis</p>
<p>Kanna's mirror is nearly destroyed in the battle, and all the trapped souls are released. Kanna, Kagura and Naraku escape. Injured, Inuyasha heads into the forest to find Kikyo. Later, the group encounters a telepathic demon named Goshinki. During the battle, Goshinki's razor-sharp teeth destroy Tetsusaiga!</p>

<li>When Sesshomaru and his dad are in their true demon forms, they become big dogs. But Inuyasha, in his demon form, looks only vaguely like Sesshomaru. Perhaps it is because he is half-human, and that's why he doesn't make the full transition.</li></ul>

<p>Kikyo's plot: Really, no one is certain why Kikyo chose to give Naraku the Sacred Jewel. So that he can get stronger. By making him stronger, it makes him harder to defeat, isn't it? She was the guardian of the Jewel, so she should know its powers. And she seems to be very confident of herself, that she would be able to cast away Naraku, his detachments AND the Sacred Jewel, even though the slightest depletion of souls would weaken her greatly.</p>
   </li>
  <li>
<p>Being Naraku's detachment, Goshinki certainly inherited some characteristics from him. For one, he certainly talks a lot, just like Naraku. You would think that a psychic would pay more attention to listening to other people's thoughts than prattling on and on. What a showoff…</p>

<p class="txtb"><a name="_ACT_I_"></a>[ ACT I ]</p>
<p>Daytime in a village. Kikyo is tending to several wounded soldiers.</p>
<p class="txt">KIK:&emsp;&ensp; (notices something) Huh?!</p>
<p>Fade to KIK walking in a forest. She stops and looks at a tree.</p>
<p class="txt">KIK:&emsp;&ensp; Come out. I've known you were there for some time now.</p>
<p>NAR, in his baboon suit, appears among the trees.</p>
<p class="txt">NAR:&emsp;&ensp;(sniggles) Kikyo, Inuyasha is bitter about you. He's half dead, thanks to the power I, Naraku, have gained since you handed over your Sacred Jewel to me.</p>
<p class="txtb">[ End of ACT I: 50sec ]</p><br>
<p class="txtb">[ Title screen: Tetsusaiga Breaks ]</p><br>
<p class="txtb"><a name="_ACT_II_"></a>[ ACT II ]</p>
<p>Continue from previous episode. INU lies on a straw bed in a hut. He has bandages over his chest. NAR's words replay in his mind.</p>
<p class="txt">NAR:&emsp;&ensp;(voice-over) Just a while longer… Soon, the Jewel will become whole. Kikyo willingly handed over the Sacred Jewel to me.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (thinking) Why Kikyo?! With the Sacred Jewel you gave him, Naraku has increased his evil powers. Just what were you thinking?! Do you still hate me so much…Kikyo? Kikyo! (winces in pain)</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; (enters the hut) Inuyasha! Are you in pain?! It's to be expected. The Tetsusaiga protected you but you still took the full force of the Wind Scar. (looks over at SAN who is resting on a straw mat next to INU) Even Sango… She shouldn't moved for a while longer. She acts brave, but she got hit with the Hiraikotsu.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Where's Kagome?</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; She and Miroku went in search of food and more medicinal herbs.</p>
<p>SAN groans in pain. KIR meows, concerned.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; Wait, Kirara. I'll go and get some cool water. (gets up)</p>
<p>SHI gets water from a small waterfall outside the hut.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; Inuyasha and Sango are injured badly. And Naraku has created two frightening demons out of his own body. What's going to happen?!</p>
<p>Soul collectors appear behind SHI. Cut to INU in the hut. Some soul collectors enter the hut.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Soul Collectors!</p>
<p>The soul collectors hover around INU for awhile and leave.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (struggling to get up) Is Kikyo near? (takes TET)</p>
<p>KIR growls. Cut to outside. SHI is tangled up by two soul collectors.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; Let go! (notices INU struggling to move outside the hut) Inuyasha!</p>
<p>INU, using TET as a clutch, struggles as he walks away weakly. He follows the soul collectors.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Kikyo!</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; Don't go! You'll be killed! Inuyasha! Inuyasha!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (thinking) Kikyo… I must see you!</p>
<p>INU trips and rolls down a slope. He lands face down in front of a tree. The soul collectors circle around a branch, and KIK appears.</p>
<p class="txt">KIK:&emsp;&ensp; Inuyasha! Inuyasha…</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (ears twitches and wakes) Ki…kyo…!</p>
<p class="txt">KIK:&emsp;&ensp; You are alive, Inuyasha. I'm glad.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Kikyo! What're you up to?! Did you really hand over your Sacred Jewel to Naraku?!</p>
<p class="txt">KIK:&emsp;&ensp; I did. In order to cast Naraku into oblivion.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Whaddya mean?! Naraku is increasing his powers now! He's already created two more demons out of his own body…Kagura of the Wind and Kanna of the Void!</p>
<p>Pan sideways to reveal KAR hiding behind another tree.</p>
<p class="txt">KAR:&emsp;&nbsp; (thinking) So Inuyasha and that Kikyo know each other.</p>
<p>Cut-scene of KAR and NAR in a room in his castle.</p>
<p class="txt">NAR:&emsp;&ensp;Kagura, follow Kikyo and find out what she's up to. She can't be trusted.</p>
<p>Back to present.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (sits up) You wanted to kill me. Isn't that why you gave Naraku your Sacred Jewel?!</p>
<p class="txt">KIK:&emsp;&ensp; (fierce) As if I'd let the likes of Naraku take your life! Do not forget this, Inuyasha! Naraku is our bitterest enemy.</p>
<p class="txt">KAR:&emsp;&nbsp; It's no fun just spying on them. Inuyasha is half-dead. He hasn't even picked up on my scent. (opens her fan) I'll kill him and Kikyo both!</p>
<p>KIK notices something amiss and glance backwards. KAR creates a wind. An arrow swiftly appears and dissipates the wind. The arrow hits the tree behind KAR, missing KAR's by an inch. KAR gasps. Cut to KIK drawing another arrow.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; K-Kagura!</p>
<p class="txt">KIK:&emsp;&ensp; Next is your head.</p>
<p>KAR pulls a feather from her hair and flies away on it.</p>
<p class="txt">KIK:&emsp;&ensp; She escaped… Inuyasha, Naraku will only grow stronger and stronger. Do not let him kill you! Until I am able to cast both Naraku and the Jewel out of this world…your life is mine. No one will have you!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (thinking) Kikyo…</p><br>
<p>KAG, MIR and SHI run across a field.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Shippo, are you sure?</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Did Kikyo's Soul Collectors really appear?</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; Inuyasha was lured out by them!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(thinking) Inuyasha…did you go to see Kikyo?!</p>
<p>KAG gasps as she sees INU walk towards them.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Kagome… (falls onto his knees)</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(knees in front of INU) Inuyasha! Are you all right?</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (avoids looking at KAG) Ah, yeah…</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(pulls INU's hair fiercely) Say! (INU groans and KAG lets go) Oh, sorry. (fierce tone again) You did see Kikyo! It's written all over your face! (INU looks away) You can't even look me in the eye! You're always like that!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Hey! It wasn't a rendezvous or anything like that!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(taken aback, thinking) So he did see her! (to INU) I-I know that, stupid!</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; (shakes his head, thinking) Oh dear… I can understand Inuyasha's hesitancy… (to INU) And what did you find out, Inuyasha? Did Kikyo really give Naraku her Sacred Jewel?</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Yeah…</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; In other words, Kikyo has joined forces with Naraku?</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (defensive) No!</p>
<p>KAG and MIR are shocked by INU's outburst.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; I don't know what Kikyo intends to do…but…</p>
<p>KAG walks off into the distance.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Kagome. What's wrong with her?</p>
<p>MIR hits INU on the head with his staff.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; What're you doing?!</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Poor Kagome…</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; (leaps onto MIR's shoulder) I'll say! When she's been so worried about you, Inuyasha! Right? (gives INU the evil eye)</p>
<p>INU looks away.</p><br>
<p>KAG walks in a huff.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(thinking) Inuyasha was hurt so badly all because Kikyo gave Naraku the Sacred Jewel. Yet he still defends her! Inuyasha, you fool!</p><br>
<p>Nighttime in a village. A purple demon stomp in front of a barn with two horses. The barn collapses and a loud crash is heard. Cut to a villager tilling the land. Another villager walks out of his house.</p>
<p class="txt">Villager 1: What's that?!</p>
<p class="txt">Villager 2: Something's going on in the barn.</p>
<p class="txt">Villager 1: Let's go and check!</p>
<p>The two villagers run off. Cut to a dead horse. Cut to the silhouette of the demon devouring the horse. The two villagers arrive at the scene. The eyes of the demon gleam a bloody red.</p>
<p class="txt">Villager 2: (taken aback) A demon!</p>
<p class="txt">Villager 1: It's eating the horse!</p>
<p>The two villagers run off. The purple demon chases and splits them apart. KAR appears at the scene.</p>
<p class="txt">KAR:&emsp;&nbsp; (disdain, thinking) Damn…what's this demon? Some brainless glutton!</p>
<p class="txt">Demon: (laughs and looks at KAR) Sister. Did you just call me a brainless glutton?</p>
<p class="txt">KAR:&emsp;&nbsp; (thinking) He's toying with me! He can read my mind!</p><br>
<p>Nighttime in the hut where INU-group rests. KAG holds up SAN while SHI and cute KIR look on. MIR is tending to the wounds of INU. SAN struggles to get up.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(holding SAN) Sango, are you able to move now?</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;I can manage…</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; Don't push yourself!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Would you like a little more medicine for the pain?</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;I'm okay. Besides, isn't it dangerous to stay here?</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Kagura was nearby…</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;I'm all right. Kagome, go tend to Inuyasha.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(angry tone) Never mind him! It seems he can walk.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; (sighs and puts a plaster violently on INU's arm wound) Apologize to Kagome, Inuyasha! I'm caught in between and I don't like it! I'd much rather stroke Sango's white skin… (sighs again)</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;No thanks!</p>
<p>MIR lets out a disappointed groan. INU suddenly gasps.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; What's the matter, Inuyasha?!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; I smell a dead man.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Huh? Dead man?</p>
<p>Outside, a man struggles towards the hut. MIR and INU come out of the hut.</p>
<p class="txt">Injured man: A demon came…! All the villagers have been devoured.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Demon?</p>
<p class="txt">Injured man: With a spider scar on its back!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (thinking) Spider scar on his back?!</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; (thinking) Another one of Naraku's incarnations!</p>
<p class="txt">Injured man: H-help…!</p>
<p>Something shoots out of the man's body and he collapses into a charred corpse.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;H-he was dead all along!</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; He was probably being controlled by Kagura with her fan. This is a trap.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; A lure to meet the three demons.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Will you go? You can't, Inuyasha! Your wounds aren't healed yet!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; I have no choice!</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Sending a dead man here means they know our whereabouts.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Yes…which means it's useless to try to escape.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Well then, I'm going! Sooner or later, they are gonna attack!</p><br>
<p>Back at the village. The purple demon stomps his foot on a chicken coop.</p>
<p class="txt">KAR:&emsp;&nbsp; One or two kids, just let them go!</p>
<p class="txt">Demon: I told Naraku I'd annihilate the entire village. So I'll kill every human! And every horse, dog and fowl!</p>
<p class="txt">Kagura: (scoffs) I'm not interested in keeping you company. Do as you please. (walks off)</p>
<p>The demon suddenly looks towards a house. Cut to interior of the house. Two kids hide under a bundle of hay. The girl is sobbing in fear.</p>
<p class="txt">Boy:&emsp;&ensp; (thinking) Don't cry, Yuki. If we hide under the hay, it won't find us!</p>
<p>The purple demon stomps towards the house and punches the roof off. He thrusts his hand into the haystack. The kids yell. The demon pull away the hay, revealing the kids.</p>
<p class="txt">Yuka:&emsp;(trembling) Brother!</p>
<p class="txt">Demon: So you thought that hiding in the hay would protect you? You cried to your ma and pa to save you, huh? I ate them up a while ago. I'm not lying. Look inside my belly!</p>
<p>The demon opens wide his mouth, towards the kids. The kids hug each other tighter and yell in fear. INU suddenly appears and fends off the demon with TET. The demon dodges the attack.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Iron-Reaver, Soul-Stealer!</p>
<p>INU claws at the demon who dodges.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (to the kids) Run away!</p>
<p>The kids run off. Cut to INU facing off with the purple demon. The rest of INU-gang arrives running at the scene.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; W-what?!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;That demon…</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Has the spider scar on its back!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; So you're the third incarnation of Naraku?</p>
<p class="txt">Demon: So you've drawn the Tetsusaiga. You thought I was big in body and small in power, huh?</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (shocked) W-what?! (thinking) He can read my mind!</p>
<p class="txt">Demon: (laughs) Yes, Inuyasha. I am able to read my opponent's mind. My sisters, Kagura and Kanna, were simply the opening acts…until I, Goshinki, made my debut!</p>
<p class="ttable">Goshinki abbreviated as GOS from now onwards.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (scoffs) Keh! You're nothing but a blabbermouth! (leaps with TET raised) You're nothing!</p>
<p>INU attacks GOS, but he dodges. Cut to GOS leaping through the air and crushing his fists on INU. INU runs away. He clutches his wound and breathes heavily.</p>
<p class="txt">GOS:&emsp;&nbsp;Didn't I tell you? I can read minds. You seem to be in pain. What? Have you reached your limit?</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Damn you! I've had just about enough! Take this!</p>
<p>GOS scoffs and zooms sideways.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; W-what?!</p>
<p class="txt">GOS:&emsp;&nbsp;(appears behind INU) I can see right through your swordplay! (slams INU with his palm, sending INU flying)</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Inuyasha!</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; No! He's not in shape to fight! (removes the beads around his hand) Wind Tunnel!</p>
<p>Buzzing noises is heard in the background.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;No! Naraku's poison insects!</p>
<p>The poison insects appear and hover in front of the group.</p>
<p class="txt">GOS:&emsp;&nbsp;Monk, thought you could suck me up into that Wind Tunnel? Too bad I know all of your weaknesses.</p>
<p>Close-up of KAG.</p>
<p class="txt">GOS:&emsp;&nbsp;Kagome…forget about shooting your arrow at me. Before you draw your arrow, I'll kill you.</p>
<p>Close-up of SAN on KIR.</p>
<p class="txt">GOS:&emsp;&nbsp;Sango, you can't fight. You still can't move due to that blow you received from your Hiraikotsu!</p>
<p>Close-up of SHI, frozen and breaking out in sweat, looking terrified.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; (thinking) What about me?</p>
<p>GOS turns away from the group. SHI's body relaxes. He leaps onto MIR's shoulder.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; (yells to Goshinki) Hey! Why do you ignore only me?!</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Don't worry, Shippo. He's just playing with you.</p>
<p>INU struggles to get up. He notices the two kids behind him, clutching onto some clothes.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (angry) You're those kids… I told you to run! Why are you still…? (stops abruptly, noticing the clothes that the kids are clutching) Did those…belong to your ma and pa?</p>
<p>The brother nods. INU's eyebrows twitches in anger. GOS stomps towards INU and the kids. INU walks in front of the kids, blocking them from GOS's path.</p>
<p class="txt">GOS:&emsp;&nbsp;&quot;Unforgivable…I'll kill him…&quot;  Isn't that what you're thinking, Inuyasha? Don't make me laugh. You're merely a half-demon, Inuyasha. Demon blood courses through half of you yet you still take pity on humans?</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Shaddup! I'll kill you!</p>
<p>A wind vortex starts to surround GOS. The same goes for INU.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; The line which brings out the ultimate power of the Tetsusaiga… (the vortexes collide) the Wind Scar!</p>
<p class="txt">GOS:&emsp;&nbsp;Inuyasha, you're trying to cut through the Wind Scar and blast me away.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; If you already know… (runs towards GOS) prepare to die!</p>
<p>The vortexes suddenly disappear.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;He cast away the Wind Scar!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Stupid! Then I'll just deliver a direct blow to your head!</p>
<p class="txt">GOS:&emsp;&nbsp;(bites onto the blade of TET) The Tetsusaiga is just another dog's fang! (bites harder and breaks the blade)</p>
<p>INU and the rest of the gang are shocked.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;The Tetsusaiga has been broken!</p>
<p class="txt">GOS:&emsp;&nbsp;(spits out the broken blade half in his mouth) I guess this proves that a demon's fangs are stronger.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (holds up a broken TET, thinking) He bit apart my Tetsusaiga! (gasps and looks at GOS)</p>
<p>GOS clenches his fist and swings it swiftly at INU, breaking his ribcage. Blood spills out as INU falls backwards.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Inuyasha!</p>
<p>INU lands hard on the ground. The broken TET lands near INU and transforms back to its rusty state. Cut to close-up of INU's glazed eyes, looking almost dead.</p>
<p class="txt">GOS:&emsp;&nbsp;Inuyasha…your mind is a total blank now. Your sword is broken and so is your spirit, huh? Or are you dead?</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(runs towards INU) Inuyasha!</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; (chases KAG) Kagome! (blocks KAG's path) Get back, Kagome!</p>
<p>GOS hits MIR from behind. He falls backwards.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Miroku!</p>
<p class="txt">GOS:&emsp;&nbsp;(laughs) Monk…even if you lost your life from deadly poison…you would try to suck me into your Wind Tunnel?</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; (rushes to MIR) Miroku!</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;(holds up MIR in her lap) Monk!</p>
<p class="txt">GOS:&emsp;&nbsp;Don't rush to your death…I'm going to devour you one by one anyway. (sniggles) And I'll start with you, Kagome.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(clenches her fist, thinking) Inuyasha…Inuyasha…</p>
<p class="txt">GOS:&emsp;&nbsp;Fool! Inuyasha is already… (stops suddenly and looks shocked, thinking) What's this?! Inuyasha's mind…! (turns around)</p>
<p>INU leaps through the air. He claws at GOS and manages to slash his right arm away. His eyes are blood red and there are purple streaks across his cheeks, similar to Sesshomaru's. INU lands. He looks fierce.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (cracking his knuckles) What's the matter, Goshinki? I thought you could read my mind!</p>
<p>Cut to the rest of INU-gang gaping at INU.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; I-Inuyasha…!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(thinking) What's happened to Inuyasha? His face…!</p>
<p class="txt">GOS:&emsp;&nbsp;I don't understand… Inuyasha, why have you transformed?</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (scoffs) Keh! Who knows?! Before you worry about me, say your prayers, Goshinki.</p>
<p class="txt">GOS:&emsp;&nbsp;(thinking) What's going on?! Inuyasha's mind is completely different from just a minute ago. There's no sadness, no fear, no confusion…not even anger. He's delighted at the thought of killing me! (runs towards to INU, yelling) You half-demon! I'll rip you apart with my fangs!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (fierce) The demon blood that flows through my body… (leaps)</p>
<p class="txt">GOS:&emsp;&nbsp;Silence!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (clenches his fist) …isn't like yours!</p>
<p class="txt">GOS:&emsp;&nbsp;This half-demon…</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (does the Iron-Reaver Soul Stealer on GOS) It's in a class much higher than you!</p>
<p>GOS's body is slashed into pieces. INU lands and GOS's head drops on the ground.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Goshinki! I enjoyed that!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Inuyasha… Inuyasha, what happened to you?!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (looking at his blood-soaked hands, thinking) I feel the blood rushing through my body. What is this?! This feeling…? I…haven't had enough killing!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Inuyasha…</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Don't get near me! I don't know what I'll do next!</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; (clings onto MIR) What's happened to you, Inuyasha?!</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; The evil side of Inuyasha is growing stronger.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Yes. He's just like a full-blooded demon!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(walks slowly towards INU, gently saying) Inuyasha…the enemy is gone.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Don't get near me!</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; Kagome!</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Don't get near him, Kagome!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(stops right in front of INU) Inuyasha…</p>
<p>INU growls and steps back defensively.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; Kagome!</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Watch out!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(softly) Inuyasha, sit!</p>
<p>INU crashes flat-faced onto the ground.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (looks up, with his face back to normal) W-what're you doing?!</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;He's back to normal.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; What?</p>

He used to be Totosai's disciple, but was banished. Why does he want to kill Inuyasha too? The sword reeks of evil aura! Inuyasha, who transformed into full-human, is in trouble again!
