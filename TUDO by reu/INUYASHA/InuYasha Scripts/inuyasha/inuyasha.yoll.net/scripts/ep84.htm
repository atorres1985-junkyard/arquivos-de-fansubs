   <li><i>Shobu flower</i><br>       The flower that Ayame carries in her hair is the Iris. For a compilation of beautifully illustrated irises, go to <a href="http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/iris/dykes/index.html" target="_blank">W.R. Dykes' <i>Genus Iris</i></a><i>. </i><span class="contri">{Wikipedia}</span> Also, Ayame's Japanese name means 'Iris flower'.<br>  </li>
 <li><i>Shobu </i>Town [菖蒲町]<br>         Interestingly, there is a town in Japan named Shobu. You can find the town website <a href="http://www.town.shobu.saitama.jp/" target="_blank">here</a>.<br>  </li>
   <li><i>Lunar Rainbow<br></i>The moon rainbow that Ayame mentions really exists. The moonbow, or night-time rainbow, can be seen on strongly-lit nights. However, as human visual perception for color in low light is poor, they are seen as white. <span class="contri">{Wikipedia}</span><br>   Here are the specific conditions needed to see a moonbow:<br>   - A bright moon near to full<br>   - Raining opposite the moon<br>   - Sky must be dark<br>   - Moon must be less than 42º high. <span class="contri">{Moonbow}</span><br>   No wonder Inuyasha had to squint so hard!</li>

<p class="txtb">[ recap ]</p>
<p>Flashback from previous episode. HMO pops out of some trees.</p>
<p class="txt">HMO:&emsp; Sacred Jewel…fragments…</p>
<p>Cut to fight between INU and HMO. INU pulls HMO by his hair and flings him over to the cliff edge.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(narrating) While searching for Naraku's whereabouts, we were attacked by a long hair monster.</p>
<p>A bunch of HMO's hair move towards KAG. KOG grabs KAG and leaps off, dodging HMO's hair.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(narrating) It was Koga who saved me that time…</p>
<p>HMO's hair in INU's hand suddenly breaks and HMO falls off the cliff. Cut to KOG and KAG in a forest. Suddenly leaves fly out and attack KOG. KOG dodge and lands on a rock.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(narrating) But we met a girl from Wolf Demon tribe who came to look for Koga.</p>
<p class="txt">AYA:&emsp;&nbsp; (lands on a rock) You promised me.</p>
<p>Cut to flashback of KOG walking in the light drizzle, piggybacking a young AYA.</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; Don't be too harsh on yourself. No matter how hard it is, (turns to AYA) I'll take you as my bride, Ayame. (smiles)</p>
<p>Cut to present.</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; (nervous) I-Is t-that t-true? D-Did I r-really say t-that?</p>
<p>AYA nods. Tears stat to well up in her eyes.</p>

<p class="txtb"><a name="AI"></a>[ ACT I ]</p>
<p>INU sprints along a path. SAN, MIR and SHI follow him on KIR's back.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; I wonder if the monster was sent by Naraku.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;We'll know once we captured it.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; He might know Naraku's whereabouts.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Let's talk about this after we saved Kagome! (to himself) Stay safe, Kagome.</p><br>
<p>In the forest. KOG is sulking in a corner. KAG and AYA sit on a log, back facing him.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;So, the Wolf Demon tribe's elder is Ayame's grandfather?</p>
<p class="txt">AYA:&emsp;&nbsp; Yes, he's my grandpa.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;But, what's the reason for you to come down from the mountain?</p>
<p class="txt">AYA:&emsp;&nbsp; I've been wondering why recently there's a strange bad aura coming from the North mountain.</p>
<p>Fade to flashback in the mountains. A miasma surrounds the area. AYA and Elder sit on a ledge by the waterfall, looking worried.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(voice-over) Strange bad aura?</p>
<p class="txt">AYA:&emsp;&nbsp; (voice-over) Grandpa told me that's the smell of a demon.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(voice-over) Demon?</p>
<p>Cut to a lot of wolf-demons gathered and fighting fiercely with each other.</p>
<p class="txt">AYA:&emsp;&nbsp; (voice-over) For the sake of the territory, the North, East and West Wolf Demon tribes started to fight against each other.</p>
<p>Cut to AYA talking to a weak-looking Elder.</p>
<p class="txt">AYA:&emsp;&nbsp; (voice-over) For the sake of our tribe, grandpa wanted me to marry a young man with power, and reunite the allies.</p>
<p>Cut to present.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(shocked) So it's a forced marriage?</p>
<p class="txt">AYA:&emsp;&nbsp; Luckily Koga had made a promise to me.</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; (shouts) But I don't remember it!</p>
<p class="txt">AYA:&emsp;&nbsp; Grandpa also thought Koga could reunite the allies. I'm willing to marry him too.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(thinking) So… it isn't just a forced marriage.</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; (clenching his head tightly) Panicking just because of the bad aura… it can be settled even though I can't reunite them!</p>
<p class="txt">AYA:&emsp;&nbsp; (stands and face KOG) It's not that simple! To reunite them, we need someone that can be trusted. They need to have faith and reliability!</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; (buries his face into his hands) It doesn't suit me.</p>
<p class="txt">AYA:&emsp;&nbsp; Koga!</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; What I want to do right now is to chop Naraku's head down. I don't have time to deal with other things!</p>
<p class="txt">AYA:&emsp;&nbsp; Why not?</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; Shut up! Go back to the mountain!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(chiding) Koga!</p>
<p>AYA is silent.</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; Ayame, why don't you stop listening to your grandpa and do what you want to do?</p><br>
<p>Cut to HMO moving through the forest by grabbing tree trunks to pull himself forward. (he has no legs-just hair, mouth and teeth)</p><br>
<p>KOG hears the noise that HMO makes.</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; Ayame, I'll just stop here.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Wait, Koga!</p>
<p class="txt">AYA:&emsp;&nbsp; (apprehensive) This bad aura…!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Bad aura?</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; That stupid Inuyasha must have let the monster go again! (rubs his nose) It's that smell… the demon should be nearby.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Koga, let's go back to Inuyasha!</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; (grabs KAG's hands) Don't worry, Kagome. I'll protect you.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(grimacing) Thanks for your kind intention, but… (thinking) this isn't the time to talk about this…!</p>
<p class="txt">AYA:&emsp;&nbsp; (looks at KAG and KOG, surprised, thinking) What? Koga said he loves her, but… this girl Kagome…</p>
<p>Suddenly, HMO pops out from a few trees and attack them. KOG grabs KAG and leaps. AYA jumps away too.</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; Come out, monster! I've something to ask you!</p>
<p>KAG is surprised.</p><br>
<p>Cut to INU-gang arriving in the forest. He sees the remnants of hair left on the tree trunks.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Which way? That way!</p>
<p>Suddenly the hair remnants jump off and attack INU, who dodges.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; (on MIR's shoulder) The long hair monster is attacking!</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;(jumps off KIR with MIR) Attacking us?</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; It's not letting us go.</p>
<p>The hair remnants attack. MIR and SAN fend them off.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Inuyasha! You must go find Kagome!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (claws some remnants) Got it! (leaps off) Kagome, wait for me!</p><br>
<p>AYA, KAG and KOG land. They face HMO.</p>
<p class="txt">HMO:&emsp; (laughs) I won't let you go. I'll eat you guys along with the Sacred Jewel fragments.</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; Ayame. I shouldn't trouble you, but please take care of Kagome.</p>
<p class="txt">AYA:&emsp;&nbsp; Take care? Me?</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; Kagome, you stay with Ayame! (leaps forward)</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Koga!</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; Who do you think you are? Only looks huge! (grabs a bunch of HMO's hair and leaps off) Watch this!</p>
<p>KOG swings the hair over a branch and pulls. When HMO comes close, he kicks off two of his sharp teeth.</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; (lands) Since you finally caught up with me, (springs forth) I want you to tell me Naraku's whereabouts!</p>
<p>A bright light appears in HMO's mouth and blinds KOG momentarily. The hair on the branch breaks off and hover in mid air.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;The hair came off!</p>
<p>AYA slashes them away with her leaf attack. Cut to KOG being grabbed by HMO's hair.</p>
<p class="txt">AYA:&emsp;&nbsp; (runs to KOG) Koga!</p>
<p>Some of HMO's hair grab AYA too, and she shrieks. KAG picks up her bow and arrow.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Hit! (shoots)</p>
<p>The sacred arrow cuts off the hair holding on to AYA. AYA falls to the ground, but a few bundles of hair still grab onto her.</p>
<p class="txt">AYA:&emsp;&nbsp; (surprised, thinking) Sacred arrow? Is Kagome a shrine maiden?</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; (struggling on the ground to get away from HMO's pull) Damn it!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(walks to AYA) Are you okay, Ayame? (thrusts an arrow onto a bundle of hair on AYA) This guy…! (strikes it several times, trying to break it)</p>
<p class="txt">AYA:&emsp;&nbsp; Why didn't you run?</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;What do you mean?</p>
<p class="txt">AYA:&emsp;&nbsp; Koga had been trying hard to fight against the monster for your sake!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Koga isn't that type of guy. Koga is fighting for both of us.</p>
<p>AYA is silent. Suddenly more hair fly towards AYA and KAG. INU pops out and claws them.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Iron Reaver, Soul Stealer!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Inuyasha!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (lands in front of KAG, worried) Are you safe, Kagome?</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;I'm okay!</p>
<p class="txt">AYA:&emsp;&nbsp; (thinking) Inuyasha? Kagome's ally?</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (turns to KOG who is still struggling) Koga, what are you doing? Kagome was put in a dangerous position!</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; Shut up! You're the one who let the monster go!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; I'll protect Kagome! Stay back, you skinny wolf!</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; I'll protect Kagome!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; What can you do to protect her?!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(walks to INU) Koga, since Inuyasha is here, you don't need to fight alone!</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; Kagome…!</p>
<p class="txt">AYA:&emsp;&nbsp; (surprised, thinking) What? Could Koga be…</p>
<p>HMO laughs.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Be careful, Inuyasha. It's dangerous to get caught in the monster's hair.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (unsheathes TET) Don't worry, Kagome. Watch this! I'll defeat it with my Wind Scar!</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; That dog-face! Coming only at the critical moment! I'll be the one to defeat this monster!</p>
<p class="txt">AYA:&emsp;&nbsp; (shocked, thinking) Koga… could that be why you're behaving this way?</p>
<p>HMO pulls harder and drags AYA and KOG towards him.</p>
<p class="txt">HMO:&emsp; I'll eat you along with the Sacred Jewel fragments.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Inuyasha, hurry! You have to save them!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (surprised) Me?</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Who else?! (shoves INU forward) Look, they're about to get eaten! Hurry!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Keh! I don't care what happens to Koga's life. But, I won't let you have the Sacred Jewel fragments!</p>
<p>INU leaps and slashes HMO's hair, but they just separate.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; The hair just flew off!</p>
<p>The separated hair grabs INU and ties its ends to some tree trunks and rocks, holding INU down.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (struggling) What?!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Inuyasha!</p>
<p class="txt">HMO:&emsp; No one can stop me now. I was finally… finally being released from Naraku.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; What?</p>
<p class="txt">HMO:&emsp; Now with the Sacred Jewel fragments, I can get back my original form.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; What?</p>
<p>The rest of INU-gang arrive at the scene.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; Kagome!</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Kagome!</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Are you safe?</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(glad) Everyone!</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Who is that girl?</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;That's Ayame. She's Koga's fiancée.</p>
<p>MIR, SHI &amp; SAN: (shocked) Fiancée?</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;I'll tell you the details later!</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; But, what on earth is that monster?</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;That monster was released from Naraku.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; You! What are you talking about?</p>
<p class="txt">HMO:&emsp; When Naraku left the castle, he left me as well.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;So this guy's not a clone that Naraku made.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;He's just a useless part…!</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; Well, it does seem useless.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Keh! No wonder. I thought you were too weak to be Naraku's clone! (pulls at a bundle of hair, breaks free and lands next to KOG) So, Koga, you were trapped by this useless garbage.</p>
<p>The Sacred Jewel in his heels glow and he breaks free.</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; (scoffs) Not anymore.</p>
<p>KOG walks to AYA and steps on a bundle of hair tying AYA. He waves his foot above AYA and the hair breaks. He then picks up AYA and flings her backwards.</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; Ayame. Stay there. I'll protect you too. Dog-face. I'll play with you later. (walks forward)</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; What was that?</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; (slaps his fist angrily) Hey, monster! You said you were left behind. In other words, you don't know Naraku's whereabouts at all! (punches HMO on the lip)</p>
<p>HMO splits where KOG hit.</p>
<p class="txt">AYA:&emsp;&nbsp; Koga…</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Don't destroy it yet, Koga. We still have things to ask!</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; Don't worry. I know what to do. Now, monster, tell me everything you know. Or else…</p>
<p class="txt">HMO:&emsp; (laughs) There's no point to talk about it. Naraku escaped to a location where no one can reach him.</p>
<p>Everybody gasps.</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; A place where no one can reach?!</p>
<p class="txt">HMO:&emsp; (laughs) Too bad. I don't know anything after that. I no longer have a way to communicate with Naraku. I don't know Naraku's actions anymore. That's what you get.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; It doesn't seem like he's lying.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Tsk! He doesn't know anything.</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; There's nothing we can do now. (cracks his knuckles) At least there's one thing this useless monster is good for!</p>
<p>KOG punches towards HMO. Suddenly HMO shifts and bites onto KOG mouth, trapping him.</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; (struggling) This bastard…!</p>
<p class="txt">AYA:&emsp;&nbsp; Koga!</p>
<p>AYA leaps to KOG and takes out the hibiscus-like flower in her hair.</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; Ayame!</p>
<p>She uses the sharp end of the hibiscus hairpin and strikes HMO's lip. A miasma emits from the wound on HMO.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;The bad aura appears again!</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Is it the power of the Iris flower?</p>
<p class="txt">HMO:&emsp; I'll eat you!</p>
<p>KOG pulls out his arm when HMO spoke.</p>
<p class="txt">AYA:&emsp;&nbsp; Koga!</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; Ayame! (hugs AYA)</p>
<p>HMO clamps shut his mouth, biting on onto AYA and KOG. He bites them again and swallows them.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; They were both eaten!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Koga! Ayame!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (thinking) Damn! I can't slice it with my Wind Scar now!</p>
<p class="txt">HMO:&emsp; Finally… I've eaten the Sacred Jewel fragments!</p>
<p>Suddenly HMO winces and starts to glow. It then explodes into tiny pieces. INU-gang is horrified. The smoke from the explosion slowly dissipates, revealing AYA kneeling on the ground and KOG in a kicking position.</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; Don't you dare to lay on me!</p>
<p class="txt">AYA:&emsp;&nbsp; Koga! Your arm… It's because I came…</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; This wound is nothing. (picks up a piece of HMO)</p>
<p>The rest of KOG-gang come running in.</p>
<p class="txt">GIN:&emsp;&ensp;Koga!</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; You finally caught up. (throws the piece of HMO to GIN) Guys, remember that smell. Let the wolves remember it too.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; If the wolves can remember Naraku's scent, they can go look for him.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Keh! (smug) That's not going to work! If the wolves could smell him, I would have already smelled it. (looks around wildly) Koga! Where did…he go?</p>
<p>KOG is holding KAG's hands. AYA has her back towards them, silent. INU gasps and grinds his teeth.</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; Kagome, I have to leave now, but… Next time, I'll bring you back Naraku's head.</p>
<p class="txt">AYA:&emsp;&nbsp; (thinking) Koga, you're in one-sided love. Can't you see that?</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(embarrassed) No… there's no need…</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; Don't make that expression, Kagome. You're going to be my bride.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (furious) W-What?</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(gasps and pushes KOG's hands away) Wait a minute, Koga! Way, way before you met me, you had already made a promise to Ayame. (fierce) Did you forget about that again?</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; (backing off) About that… I don't remember.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(shakes her finger) Think again, during the night of full moon with rainbow… What did you say to her?</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; (closes his eyes, concentrating) Moon's… rainbow…</p>
<p>A image of the night sky and the full moon flashes across the screen. Cut to present.</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; (shocked) What…</p>
<p>Cut to flashback of KOG fighting the Birds of Paradise and saving AYA. Cut to KOG piggybacking AYA in the drizzle.</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; I'll take you as my wife. When you come down from the mountain.</p>
<p>Cut to nighttime, full moon. KOG and AYA are in the mountain.</p>
<p class="txt">AYA:&emsp;&nbsp; (points) Look.</p>
<p>A rainbow appears across the sky.</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; The moon's rainbow…</p>
<p>Cut to present. KOG gasps in horror, closes his eyes and recompose himself.</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; It's too bad. I don't remember.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Koga, you did see a rainbow, right?</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; I don't remember seeing one. Ayame was this… (making a 'she was this short', gesture)</p>
<p>KOG eyes AYA, who is silent. He pauses and chagrins.</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; Furthermore, it was so long ago…</p>
<p class="txt">AYA:&emsp;&nbsp; (smiles uncomfortably) Forget about the past. (turns to KOG) I understand how hard you need to get Naraku.</p>
<p>Cut to SAN, MIR and SHI.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;(whispers to MIR) Kagome, Koga are caught in a love triangle?</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; (whispers back) No, not like that. Ayame came to get Koga.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; (on MIR's shoulder, whispering in gossipy manner) But, Koga only likes Kagome. However, Kagome won't get into two relationships.</p>
<p>INU thumps SHI on the head and he falls to the ground.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; (sits up and feels the bump on his head, furious) What are you doing, Inuyasha?!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Shut up!</p>
<p>Cut to KOG and AYA.</p>
<p class="txt">AYA:&emsp;&nbsp; Until you get rid of Naraku, grandpa and I will do something for the tribes.</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; I see.</p>
<p class="txt">AYA:&emsp;&nbsp; But, I won't give up on you. Please remember it!</p>
<p>Everyone is taken aback.</p>
<p class="txt">AYA:&emsp;&nbsp; Your wife can only be me.</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; (panicking) M-My wife… must be able to see the Sacred Jewel fragments. (pulls KAG over) Kagome can see them!</p>
<p class="txt">AYA:&emsp;&nbsp; Can see? The Sacred Jewel fragments? (pauses, determined) So, I'll learn to see them too!</p>
<p>INU gasps. Cut to MIR and SAN tilting toward each, staring at AYA. Cut to SHI wide-eyed. Cut to KAG and KOG looking shocked.</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; (stuttering) Learn how to see… You can't learn…</p>
<p class="txt">AYA:&emsp;&nbsp; (determined) I will!</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; (stern) You can't!</p>
<p class="txt">AYA:&emsp;&nbsp; I will, I will!</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; (yelling) You can't, you can't!</p>
<p>AYA suddenly breaks into giggles.</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; W-What is it?</p>
<p class="txt">AYA:&emsp;&nbsp; (pats KOG on the shoulder, smiling confidently) Just wait for that day. (turns around)</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; (holding out his hand) Oi…</p>
<p class="txt">AYA:&emsp;&nbsp; Bye! (turns into a tornado and spins off)</p>
<p>Everyone is still recovering from the shock. SHI jumps onto MIR's shoulder.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; Hey, Miroku. If you're under practice, could you see Sacred Jewel fragments like Kagome?</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; I doubt it.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;But, she seems trying to see them.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; She has confidence too.</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; (frowning) Ayame is… so stupid.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Koga. The story is over now, (cracks his knuckles threateningly) give up the Sacred Jewel fragments in your legs. (attacks KOG's legs) Give it to me!</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; (leaps and dodges) Fat hope! See you, Kagome!</p>
<p>KOG turns into a tornado and twirls away. GIN, HAK and the wolves run after him.</p>
<p class="txt">GIN:&emsp;&ensp;Goodbye, sister!</p>
<p class="txt">HAK:&emsp; Wait up, Koga!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Damn it!</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; But Inuyasha, it might help if the number of Koga's allies increases.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; That's too easy! If the scent could be our clues, why did Naraku leave behind the garbage? The garbage represent bad smell. How could he be so careless?</p>
<p>MIR, SHI and SAN huddle together and give INU a 'I can't believe you're so smart!' look.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; (shocked) He has a point!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Naraku has great confidence that he won't be found. Isn't that right?</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; (nods gravely) Agreed.</p>
<p>INU looks pleased with himself. There is a short pause.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; And then?</p>
<p>INU looks up and gives a 'huh?' look.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Not that. Where do you think Naraku went to? (SHI inches forward seriously) Let me hear your thoughts.</p>
<p>There is a short pause. INU smirks and walks backwards to MIR and spins around.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (low voice) I'll let you think about it.</p>
<p>MIR sighs.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;(thinking) So he wasn't thinking about it.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; (clenches his fist, thinking) Well, I'll have to be more responsible.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(thinking) But, what Inuyasha said is not wrong.</p>
<p>Cut to evening view of the landscape.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(voice-over) Naraku escaped to a place where no one can find him. Where should we search?</p>
<p class="txtb">[ End of ACT I: 19min 12sec ]</p><br>
<p class="txtb"><a name="AII"></a>[ ACT II ]</p>
<p>Nighttime. It is full moon. The fireflies are out. KOG stand by a river, alone and deep in thoughts.</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; We were near to a river that night…</p>
<p>Cut to a small rainbow formed in a small waterfall nearby. KOG notices it.</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; (clenches his sword tightly, thinking) I don't wish to lose to Naraku. But taking revenge is not my only goal.</p>
<p>KOG looks at the rainbow again.</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; (softly) Forget about the moon and the rainbow, Ayame.</p>
<p>KOG turns around and walks off. Pan upwards to full moon.</p><br>
<p>Fade to full moon over a field. AYA is looking at it, alone.</p>
<p class="txt">AYA:&emsp;&nbsp; (thinking) I won't forget how you saved me… even when the rainbow disappears…</p><br>
<p>Cut to full moon over a knoll. INU lies on his back, looking at it. KAG sits next to him.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; It's so annoying! I was finally able to break Naraku's barrier, yet…</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Hopefully, we'll find Naraku. If we all search together.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (sits up) What do you mean together? Are you counting Koga in there? (scoffs) He has never given up on you despite his fiancée, you'll surely count on him too.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Are you still jealous?</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; I-I'm not jealous!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(deadpan) So you're not jealous.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (pauses, then in monotone) It doesn't matter…</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;You started it.</p>
<p>INU blushes and twitches. Suddenly, the rest of INU-gang appears behind them. KIR and SHI are asleep.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Well, just carry on.</p>
<p>SAN sighs. A sweat drop flows down INU's face and he lies back down. He turns away from KAG.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; That's enough.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(thinking) That's not good. (sighs, thinking) Ayame is so devoted to Koga. It'll be good if Inuyasha would be like that.</p>
<p>KAG looks at the moon.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;The moon's rainbow…</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Rainbow doesn't show up at night.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;It will. To those who can see it…</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Really?</p>
<p>INU tries very hard to see it. MIR and SAN look up at the moon, smiling.</p>
<p class="txtb">[ End of ACT II: 22min 9sec ]</p><br>

<p class="txtb">[ Preview for next episode ]</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; No… Since Naraku's disappearance, the demons who were in hiding have come out again!</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;All thanks to them, our demon-slaying business is looking up again!</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; But it is harder too.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;That old granny who claims to be a demon-slayer, didn't even flinch when surrounded by evil aura.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; I wonder if it's because she's very powerful, or that she's very slow.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;I think we should just pack up and go! Next on Inuyasha, &quot;<a href="ep85.htm">The Evil Within Demon Head's Castle</a>&quot;.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Wow… what a beautiful princess…! Just hand this task to me!</p>
