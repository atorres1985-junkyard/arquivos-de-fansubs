<ul><li><span class="serif"><b>Legend of Saiyuki</b>&nbsp; 『 西遊記 』</span><br>&nbsp;<br>
<i>The Legend of Saiyuki</i> or<i> Journey to the West</i> is a well-known Chinese classic by Wu Cheng En [吳承恩]. It is a fictionalized and mythologized tale of the pilgrimage of Buddhist monk <i>Xuanzang</i> [玄奘] to India to obtain scriptures. In the novel, Xuanzang's pilgrimage is accompanied by three disciples - the Monkey King <i>Sun Wukong </i>[孫悟空], the Pig demon <i>Zhu Wuneng</i> [豬悟能] and half water demon <i>Sha Wujing</i> [沙悟淨]. The three tag along to atone for past sins. Along the way, they fight countless demons who lust after Xuanzang's flesh. It is said that eating the flesh of Xuanzang would grant immortality.<br>&nbsp;<br>
<i>Journey to the West</i> is part of the four greatest works in Chinese literature, and many have adapted the story into drama, movies, comic, etc. In the Taoist religion, the Monkey King is even revered as a God of his own right. The complete novel in simplified Chinese characters can be found <a href="http://xahlee.org/p/monkey_king/monkey_king.html" target="_blank">here</a>. <span class="contri">{Wikipedia}</span><br>&nbsp;</li>
<li><span class="serif"><img src="../images/char/choyuukai.gif" width="70" height="80" align="left" style="padding-right:10px; ">Cho Hakkai [豬八戒]</span><br>
Chokyuukai claims to be the descendant of Cho Hakkai. Cho Hakkai was originally a general, his title being <i>Tianpeng Marshall</i> [天蓬元帅] who commaned over 10, 000 heavenly troops. However, at a party in Heaven, he was captivated by the beauty of the Moon Goddess and tried to get close to her. He was banished to earth, where by mishap he fell into a pig farm and was reborn as a pig demon. His flirtatious ways still remained, and hence when Chokyuukai said, &quot;I wanted to honor my ancestor, and that’s why I chose to marry human girls.&quot;, it was in line with Cho Hakkai's character. Cho Hakkai's weapon was a rake, however, and not a sword like Chokyuukai's. Chokyuukai is actually a play on the name Cho Hakkai. Cho Hakkai has the character 'eight' in his name, and Chokyuukai has the character 'nine' in his name. <br>&nbsp;</li>
<li><span class="serif"><img src="../images/char/monkey.gif" width="70" height="80" align="left" style="padding-right:10px; ">Son Goku [孙悟空]</span><br>
One of Chokyuukai's sidekick is supposed to be the descendant of Son Goku. Legend tells that Son Goku was born out of a rock and through his many adventures he was able to master an array of amazing abilities and powers, including 72 transformations. He was invited to Heaven for a promotion in the hope that to make him more manageable. But he stole the Peaches of Immortaility and wolved them down, increasing his powers even more. Everyone in heaven tried to subdue him, but even the most powerful gods were helpless. He was finally trapped under a mountain by Buddha himself for five centuries, until he was offered a chance to serve Sanzo in his pilgrimage.<br>&nbsp;</li>
<li><span class="serif"><img src="../images/char/kappa.gif" width="70" height="80" align="left" style="padding-right:10px; ">Sha Gojo [沙悟凈]</span><br>
One of Chokyuukai's sidekick is supposed to be the descendant of Sha Gojo. Sha Gojo was also a general in Heaven. He broke a valuable vase which infuriated the Jade Emperor. As punishment, he was stroked 800 times with a rod and exiled to earth, where he was to be reincarnated as a terrible man-eating Sand Demon. There he lived in a river with sandy waters. Every seven days a sword would be sent from heaven to stab him 100 times in the chest before flying off. The Goddess of Mercy recruited him to serve Sanzo's pilgrimage in exchange for relief from his suffering. During the Journey to the West, his swimming ability was quite useful. Perhaps because of his affinity with water, he is known as a kappa in Japan.<br>&nbsp;</li>
<li>Kappa<br>The kappa is a type of Japanese aquatic demonm which are said to bestow favor on anyonw who gives them their favorite food &mdash; the cucumber. For more info, read <a href="http://www.youkaimura.org/kappa.htm" target="_blank">Kappa</a> at <span class="contri">{Youkaimura}</span>.</li>
<li><span class="serif">Tiara</span><br>Both the monkey and kappa wear tiaras. Chokyuukai also uses the tiara to control the girls he abducts. This is actually a reference to Journey to the West. The three disciples of Sanzo had committed great sins and can be hard to manage for a kind-hearted and peaceful monk like Sanzo. Hence the Goddess of Mercy gave him three tiaras to be worn by the disciples. By chanting a certain spell, the tiara would become smaller and cause great pain to the wearer. No matter how much one tried, one can't remove the tiara.<br>&nbsp;</li>
<li><span class="serif">Japanese adaptation of Journey to the West</span><br>&nbsp;<br>
<i>Journey to the West</i> is known as <i>Legend of Saiyuki</i> in Japan. It was adapted into manga and anime <i>Saiyuki</i>. The names have been changed like this:
<table border="0" cellspacing="10" cellpadding="0">
<tr><td><b>Original name </b>&nbsp;<b>Japanese name</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>Xuanzang玄奘Sanzo</td></tr>
<tr><td>Sun Wukong孙悟空Son Goku</td></tr>

</table></li>
<li>Chokyuukai: So you're afraid of me, and trying to flee now with your tails between your legs?<br>Shippo: Who do you think you are?! You're just a useless demon!<br>&nbsp;<br>Chokyuukai actually uses the phrase 'Shippo' in this sentence. Shippo can also be translated as 'tail', hence by using this phrase, Shippo took offence.</li></ul></td></tr>
<tr><td><p class="ttextb">Oddities</p>
<ul><li>This is the first time we hear someone other than Miroku ask ‘Will you bear my child?’.</li>
<li>Did you notice in Inuyasha’s imagination of Kagome with Chokyuukai, she was lying affectionately on him even though she wasn’t wearing the tiara? And the bed of flowers they were lying on were roses and not some native Japanese flowers? (see image)</li>
<li><i>Journey to the West</i> was written in 1590, and the Sengoku periods ended in 1615, hence there isn't enough time for Cho Hakkai to procreate and for Chokyuukai to have him as ancestor.</li>

<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Amidst the chaos of the Warring States Era, we continue our journey.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;In a time 500 years ago, everyone’s fate is tied to the fragments of the Sacred Jewel.</p>
<p class="txt">INU &amp; KAG: Let’s battle on! Inuyasha!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;A dominating demon appears. I like pork chops, but I don’t want to marry a pig! Why do I need to marry him?!</p>
<br>
<p class="txtb"><a name="AI"></a>[ ACT I ]</p>
<p>Flashback from previous episode when KAG returned home and joined the Culture Festival.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(narrating) After quite some time, I've finally returned to the modern era again. Some weird demons appeared during the Culture Festival in my school.</p>
<p>Cut to KAG acting onstage with Hojo when INU crashed in. Suddenly the stage rumbles and a watermelon-like demon bursts from the stage ground.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;D-Demon?! Inuyasha… no, Pekopon, do something!!!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; You didn't have to tell me that! Wind Scar!!!</p>
<p>INU leaps heroically and throws a Wind Scar at the demon. It destroys the demon and a good part of the auditorium, creating a hole in the ceiling. Hojo is in awe and shock.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (to Hojo, smug, childish) How was that?!</p>
<p>Cut to KAG and INU walking home in the evening.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(narrating) After this, we've finally returned to the Warring States Era. Let's work hard to search for the last Sacred Jewel fragment!</p>
<br>
<p>Back in Sengoku period, in a village. The sky in ominous with purple clouds. Villagers are holding their farming tools as weapons, and gathered in the village square, waiting for something. Cut to interior of hut. A father is holding up a hoe while his daughter and wife cower behind him.</p>
<p class="txt">Daughter: Father… Mother… I might not be able to see you again after tonight.</p>
<p class="txt">Mother: It'll be alright. We will protect you.</p>
<p class="txt">Father: Don't worry. We won't hand you to the demon.</p>
<p class="txt">Villager 1: (background) He's here!</p>
<p>The father gasps. Cut to outside. Clouds gather and a whirlwind spins towards the villagers. Three pairs of eyes gleam through the whirlwind.</p>
<p class="txt">Demon: Here I am! My bride…! Where is she?</p>
<p>The demon slams the ground with his weapon. The villagers panic and run away, dropping their weapons. The demon strikes the ground, which shatters the hut. The father and mother are unconscious after the strike. The daughter is horrified..</p>
<p class="txt">Demon: So beautiful…</p>
<p>Suddenly a tiara is placed around the girl's forehead and her eyes go glazed.</p>
<p class="txt">Demon: Pretty lady, will you bear my child?</p>
<p class="txt">Daughter: (adoringly) Yes, Master.</p>
<p>The demon spins towards the daughter and takes her away.</p>
<p class="txt">Demon: Let's go,  my bride!</p>
<p>The father and mother regain consciousness just in time to see their daughter taken away up into the sky. The ominous clouds dissipate and the sky goes back to normal. Villagers peep out from their hiding spots behind some trees. A young man grinds his teeth angrily.</p>
<br>
<p class="txtb">[ Title screen: Chokyuukai and the Abducted Bride ]</p>
<br>
<p>Daytime in KAE's village. INU-gang and the angry young man from earlier on are talking to KAE.</p>
<p class="txt">KAE:&emsp;&ensp;What? A demon who snatches village maidens?</p>
<p class="txt">Man:&emsp; Yes. Recently… Many demons appeared at the shrine, and released the demons who were sealed. This demon abducts beautiful women against their will, and makes them carry his child.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;How could he…</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; (furious) That's ridiculous. Asking them to bear his children? How can he do that?</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;(gives MIR the eye) Do you really think so?</p>
<p class="txt">Man:&emsp; If we don't hand him the girls, he'll destroy our village.</p>
<p class="txt">KAE:&emsp;&ensp;How can he be so violent?</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; We'd like to help, but we're searching for the last Sacred Jewel fragment at the moment.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;But how can we ignore it? It might have some connections with demons released from Mount Hakurei.</p>
<p class="txt">KAE:&emsp;&ensp;(looks around) Can anyone help?</p>
<p>No one replies. INU stands.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; If that's the case, just leave it to me.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Inuyasha!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; I'll be right back after dealing with this demon.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; There shouldn't be any problem if Inuyasha is going with you.</p>
<p class="txt">Man:&emsp; (glad) Thanks for your help! I really feel bad for letting those girls stay in the cave.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; What was… that?</p>
<p class="txt">Man:&emsp; All the girls are staying in the cave. That's where they hide themselves from the demon.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; (sighs and stands) I shall go with you then. Inuyasha can't deal with this all alone.</p>
<p>SAN stands.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Sango as well?</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;I'm worried about those girls too. But it's different…</p>
<p>KAG seems worried.</p>
<br>
<p>Cut to INU-gang walking away with the young man. KAG waves goodbye to KAE.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Granny Kaede, we'll be back soon!</p>
<p class="txt">KAE:&emsp;&ensp;(disbelief) Do they have to go together?</p>
<br>
<p>Cut to INU-gang walking. MIR is talking to the young man.</p>
<p class="txt">Man:&emsp; The demon only looks for single young girls.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Only single young girls…</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(whispers to SAN) We must be more careful.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;(whispers to KAG) Yes, we must be careful.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (to SHI) Why is Sango is a daze?</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; (with folded arms) You won't be able to understand…</p>
<p>KAG sighs.</p>
<p class="txt">Man:&emsp; It's over there. It's that cave.</p>
<p>INU-gang looks up at a cave entrance in a hill.</p>
<br>
<p>Cut to INU-gang and the young man walking in a tunnel in the cave. At the end of a tunnel, a young village girl peeps out.</p>
<p class="txt">Girl 1:&nbsp;&nbsp; Brother Kisuke?</p>
<p>The young man, Kisuke, is glad to see her.</p>
<p class="txt">Girl 1:&nbsp;&nbsp; Everyone, Brother Kisuke is here to save us!</p>
<p>A horde of girls rush out and surround Kisuke happily.</p>
<p class="txt">Girl 2:&nbsp;&nbsp; Brother Kisuke!</p>
<p class="txt">Girl 3:&nbsp;&nbsp; That's great…</p>
<p class="txt">Girl 4:&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks Brother Kisuke.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; What's this…?</p>
<p class="txt">Kisuke: Don't worry, everyone. I've found these demon exterminators for you. (looks to MIR) You can just count on them.</p>
<p>MIR is dazed by the sheer number of pretty girls.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; Except their personalities!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; What?</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; (frowns) I was referring to Miroku.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; (coughs) On our way here, I had figured out a good way to prevent you from being chosen by the demon.</p>
<p class="txt">Girl 1:&nbsp;&nbsp; Have you really figured it out?</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; (steps up to Girl 1, in serious tone) Yes, and there's only one way.</p>
<p>The girls are happy to hear that there's a solution.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; I heard that the demon only looks for single girls.</p>
<p class="txt">Girl 1:&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, that's true.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; So young lady… (holds Girl 1's hand) to get rid of this demon, bear my child instead. So the demon will never bother you again.</p>
<p class="txt">Girl 1:&nbsp;&nbsp; I see…</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Priest… (shakes fist angrily) That's not funny at all.</p>
<p>MIR laughs uneasily. Suddenly purple clouds gather outside the cave.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Evil energy!</p>
<p class="txt">Kisuke: Oh no… we might have been discovered!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Inuyasha!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Did the evil energy come from that demon? What a strong smell…!</p>
<p>KAG and INU run out of the cave.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Priest.</p>
<p>SAN turns to get MIR when she sees MIR still tending to the bevy of girls.</p>
<p class="txt">Girl 1:&nbsp;&nbsp;  Hurry up, Priest.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Sure.</p>
<p class="txt">Girl 2:&nbsp;&nbsp; Can I be the next?</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; No problem…</p>
<p>The girls form a line behind Girl 1 & 2. SAN knocks MIR on the forehead with HIR.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;He's spouting nonsense, don't trust him!</p>
<p>The girls look at SAN, bewildered.</p>
<br>
<p>Cut to outside of cave. INU turns to Kisuke.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Don't bring the girls out!</p>
<p class="txt">Kisuke: That demon looks horrible.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (smirks) This is going to be interesting! (runs)</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Wait, I'm coming too! (follows)</p>
<p>MIR, SAN and KIR come running out of the cave and follow them.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Okay, leave the girls in the cave! Let's fight with the demon!</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; This seems to be a powerful demon. Will the girls be alright?</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Kagome's scent will mislead him!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(glares) If that demon likes pretty girls, I'm willing to leave with him!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Pretty girls…? (looks around) Where are they?</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Sit!</p>
<p>INU crashes to the ground.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; Indeed an idiot.</p>
<p>KIR growls in agreement.</p>
<br>
<p>Cut to KAG standing on a mound in an open area. The rest of INU-gang peep out from the trees a distance behind her. A whirlwind descends from the sky and the demon from earlier on appears.</p>
<p class="txt">Demon: Give up, and become my bride!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(thinking) That's him.</p>
<p>The whirlwind dissipates to reveal a confused looking kappa, a small monkey and a chirpy pig demon. The pig demon holds a long rope which is tied around the kappa and monkey. KAG gapes at them in disbelief.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;A-Are you the one who has been snatching the village maidens?</p>
<p class="txt">Pig:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You're right. Pretty girl, will you bear my child?</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(grimaces) This sounds familiar…</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Hey hey… You'd better give up now.</p>
<p>The rest of INU-gang walk up from their hiding spots.</p>
<p class="txt">Pig:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (furious) Who are you?</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; I thought you're some kind of strong demon, but you're just a pig demon.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; (disappointed) He's only a pig demon?</p>
<p class="txt">Pig:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (frustrated) I'm not a pig demon, I'm Pig Marshal!</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Well, that's fine. Inuyasha, he's all yours.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Are you kidding? I won't even bother.</p>
<p>MIR and INU walk away.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Sango, we'll count on you then!</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;You two!</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Yes!</p>
<p>Both INU and MIR freeze in motion.</p>
<p class="txt">Pig:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So you're afraid of me, and trying to flee now with your tails between your legs?</p>
<p class="ttable">The pig demon actually uses the phrase 'Shippo' in this sentence. Shippo can also be translated as 'tail', hence by using this phrase, Shippo took offence.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; (furious) Who do you think you are?! You're just a useless demon!</p>
<p>The kappa rushes out and have a childish fight with Shippo, while the monkey goes on all fours and glare at KIR.</p>
<p class="txt">Pig:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Humph! How dare you make a fool of Chokyuukai?</p>
<p class="ttable">Chokyuukai abbreviated as CHO from now onwards</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Chokyuukai…? I've heard that name somewhere before…</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Do you know him?</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(offended) I like pork chops, but I don't have a pig friend!</p>
<p class="txt">CHO:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I told you I'm not a pig demon, but a Pig Marshal!</p>
<p>Cut to close up of kappa.</p>
<p class="txt">CHO:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is my comrade, descendant of the Great General in Heaven, Sha Gojo!</p>
<p>Cut to close up of monkey.</p>
<p class="txt">CHO:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And this is the descendant of the Monkey God, Son Goku!</p>
<p>Cut to the three demons.</p>
<p class="txt">CHO:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I'm the strongest of them, the descendant of Tianpeng Marshall, Cho Hakkai! I'm Chokyuukai!</p>
<p>INU and MIR: (gaping) Huh?!</p>
<p class="txt">CHO:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Am I scaring you? I wanted to honor my ancestor, and that's why I chose to marry human girls.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; What's up with this pig?</p>
<p class="txt">CHO:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You've never heard of the 'Journey to the West'?</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Oh ya…</p>
<p>Everyone looks at KAG in surprise.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(awed) So you're the descendant of Cho Hakkai from 'Journey to the West'!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Do you know this?</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; I don't know…</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; (shakes head) I don't understand at all, but Kagome seems to know about it.</p>
<p class="txt">CHO:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pretty girl, you mean you've heard of our ancestors?</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;'Journey to the West' is a well-known Chinese story. It's about the monk, Sanzo, who travels to the West for the Buddhist Scriptures, with a monkey, a water demon, and a pig demon.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; So you really know about him?</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(mad) I told you that I like pork chops, but I don't know him!</p>
<p class="txt">CHO:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I didn't expect that you've heard of my ancestors. You're really a smart girl. Pretty girl, I shall make you my bride.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;No!</p>
<p class="txt">CHO:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (gushing) No means yes! I will marry you no matter what!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(riled) I like pork chops, but not you.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (scratches head in frustration) What is she talking about?!</p>
<p class="txt">CHO:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (laughs) Watch this.</p>
<p>CHO takes out a tiara and throws it at KAG. KAG gasps.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Watch out!</p>
<p>INU rushes out and pushes KAG aside. The tiara lands on his head instead.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Inuyasha?</p>
<p>INU's eyes turn dreamy and he looks at CHO adoringly.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; (jumps onto SAN) Inuyasha looks weird…!</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Inuyasha?</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; What's wrong, Inuyasha?</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (giggles and walks towards CHO) Master…</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(shocked) Keh! Inuyasha, I didn't know you were of 'that kind'!</p>
<p>MIR and SAN run towards INU.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; That's not the case!</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; There's something wrong about that tiara!</p>
<p class="txt">MIR and SAN pounce on INU and pry the tiara off from INU's head. The tiara finally comes off and INU looks around, bewildered.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; W-What's wrong…?</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;You were about to marry Chokyuukai a while ago.</p>
<p>INU growls in disgust.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Could this tiara be able to make anyone fall in love with him? (excited) That means I can make girls fall for me?!</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;(snatches tiara away from MIR) That's enough! What are you thinking of? Why you!</p>
<p>SAN uses the tiara to knock MIR, but he ends up wearing it instead. His eyes turn dreamy.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; (to CHO adoringly) Master…</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; So it only makes people fall in love with its owner.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Anyone who wears that will fall in love with Chokyuukai?</p>
<p>MIR starts walking towards CHO.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Wait, Priest!</p>
<p class="txt">CHO:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm getting tired of this!</p>
<p>CHO waves his hand. The tiara comes off from MIR and floats towards KAG. INU tries desperately to grab the tiara and KAG tries to dodge, but the tiara lands on KAG anyway.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Damn!</p>
<p class="txt">CHO:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Come on, pretty girl.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(adoringly) Yes, Master.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (blocks KAG's way) No way!</p>
<p class="txt">CHO:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Don't ruin my plan!</p>
<p>CHO raises his hand and a whirlwind appears. It twists around KAG and brings her next to CHO. KAG leans on CHO affectionately.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Kagome? Kagome!!</p>
<p>CHO laughs happily.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Master…</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (furious) Why you…!!</p>
<p class="txt">CHO:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well then… Son Goku, Sha Gojo!</p>
<p class="txt">Son Goku & Sha Gojo: Yes!</p>
<p class="txt">CHO:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fight!</p>
<p>The kappa and monkey run towards INU. INU glares at them furiously and lets out a bark. The two are frightened and run back to CHO.</p>
<p class="txt">CHO:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can't you two fight with that stupid dog?</p>
<p>The two nod.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; You bastards! (draws TET) I'll send you all to hell!</p>
<p class="txt">CHO:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Give it up! You'd better tuck your tail between your legs and run!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Shut up, damn pig demon!</p>
<p class="txt">CHO:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll get rid of you no matter what! You stupid dog!</p>
<p>CHO rushes at INU with his sword. Their blades clash.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Kill me if you dare!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Buck up, Master!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (shocked) Kagome…?!</p>
<p>CHO takes the chance and knocks INU to the ground.</p>
<p class="txt">CHO:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (swinging sword) Go to hell!</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Inuyasha!</p>
<p>SAN throws HIR at CHO, who leaps backwards to his comrades and KAG.</p>
<p class="txt">CHO:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks for giving me this girl.</p>
<p>A gust of wind starts to blow around them.</p>
<p class="txt">CHO:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (smiles to KAG) Let's go!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Yes, Master.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Don't go…!</p>
<p>The wind turns stronger and into a whirlwind. It carries them back into the clouds.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Damn it! Kagome…!</p>
<br>
<p>Cut to a temple on a hill. The whirlwind appears in the clouds above and lands in the courtyard. A bevy of girls greet CHO.</p>
<p class="txt">Girls:	Welcome back, Master!</p>
<p class="txt">CHO:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I've brought you a new friend. (to KAG) Take your seat, my most beloved one.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Yes, Master.</p>
<p class="txtb">[ End of ACT I: 15min 59sec ]</p>
<br>
<p class="txtb"><a name="AII"></a>[ ACT II ]</p>
<p>Back to INU-gang. INU strikes TET on the ground furiously.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; Are you okay, Inuyasha?</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (shaking in anger) Damn it, right now… Right now… Could Kagome be…!</p>
<p>Cut to INU's imagination of KAG lying on CHO affectionately in a bed of roses.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(giggling) Master…</p>
<p>Back to present.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; I can't take it anymore!</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;There's no point sighing here!</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; That demon came from a Chinese legend. We might be able to deal with him in a traditional way. (takes out a charm) If we use a talisman, we might be able to seal him. This may work.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;But, how do we get him?</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; I'll trace him with his smell… But, we've got to be more careful since Kagome is with him now.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;That's true.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; I have an idea. Shippo, listen.</p>
<p>SHI jumps onto MIR's shoulders. MIR whispers something to him.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; That sounds risky, are you sure it works?</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Don't worry, we'll be there to help you.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; (determined) I must do my best!</p>
<br>
<p>Back to CHO's temple. He is drinking in a grand room. The bevy of girls sit around him, while KAG holds up a bottle of sake, smiling.</p>
<p class="txt">CHO:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm so happy today! Any girls who want to serve me? (laughs)</p>
<p class="txt">Girl:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (background) Excuse me… Is anyone there?</p>
<p class="txt">CHO:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What a sweet voice!</p>
<br>
<p>Cut to CHO and KAG running to the balcony. A girl wearing a large hat with a veil is standing at the shrine entrance.</p>
<p class="txt">CHO:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What can I do for you?</p>
<p class="txt">Girl:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm sorry, I've lost my way. May I stay in your house for today?</p>
<p class="txt">CHO:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (laughs) Sure, you can stay as long as you wish to. (jumps off the balcony and lands in front of girl) Can I see your face?</p>
<p class="txt">Girl:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (shy) I'll get embarrassed…</p>
<p>A tail pops out from behind the girl. The girl turns out to be SHI in make-up and disguise. CHO looks shocked. Cut to the rest of INU-gang looking on from behind some trees in the distance.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (sighs) It's over.</p>
<p class="txt">CHO:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (pondering) Little girl, will you bear my child?</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; Well…</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; He hasn't noticed yet.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Is he really so stupid?</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (notices KAG on the balcony, thinking) Kagome.</p>
<p class="txt">CHO:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You've traveled a long way, why don't you come in?</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; (thinking, grimacing) Please hurry up, Inuyasha!</p>
<p class="txt">CHO:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What's wrong? Are you overly excited? Let me share your joy! (shakes body)</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; (thinking) I… can't… hold it! I can't hold it anymore!</p>
<p>SHI pops back into his original form.</p>
<p class="txt">CHO:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What?! So you're the partner of that stupid dog!</p>
<p>By then, INU has leaped up the balcony.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Wake up now, Kagome! (knocks tiara off KAG)</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(glad) Inuyasha!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (hands KAG her bow and arrows, smiles) Here you are.</p>
<p class="txt">CHO:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You've tricked me!</p>
<p>SHI panics and rushes over to SAN and MIR, who have walked out from the trees.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Shippo, well done!</p>
<p class="txt">CHO:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I won't let you snatch my bride! Watch this!</p>
<p>CHO raises his hand. His sword flies from inside the shrine and lands in his hand. He laughs and swings it towards SAN and MIR, who dodge.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Hurry up, Inuyasha. Pass the talisman to Kagome!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (hands KAG the charm) Here's the charm that will seal the demon. Do it now!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;I got it!</p>
<p>INU jumps off the balcony and lands in front of CHO. CHO rushes at him and they fight. CHO swings his sword violently, nearly knocking INU away.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (smirks) I didn't expect you'd have such a good sword!</p>
<p class="txt">CHO:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There're still more to go.</p>
<p>CHO points his sword at INU, and a vortex appears around the blade.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; So you want to fight with me!</p>
<p>INU points TET at CHO, and a vortex appears around TET too. CHO laughs. He suddenly gasps and sniffs the air.</p>
<p class="txt">CHO:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What's this…?</p>
<p>Cut to KAG pointing an arrow at him. The charm is tied around the arrow. CHO notices and panics.</p>
<p class="txt">CHO:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No! Don't do it!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;That's the price to be paid for snatching innocent girls!</p>
<p class="txt">CHO:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stop it!</p>
<p>CHO runs around in circles. KAG fires and hits him in the butt. CHO spins around in pain and into a whirlwind. The whirlwind then flies back into the sky.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (gapes) Amazing…</p>
<p>The sky is bright and clear again.</p>
<br>
<p>Night time. INU-gang is escorting the girls that CHO abducted back to the village.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; That pig was so annoying! But, I guess he won't dare to come out again.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Luckily the girls were saved.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;That's right. Priest… (turns to look at MIR)</p>
<p>MIR is holding the hand of a girl.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Pretty girl, will you bear my child?</p>
<p>The girls step back, horrified.</p>
<p class="txt">Girl 5:&nbsp;&nbsp; (to Girl 6) This priest is saying the same words as the demon…!</p>
<p class="txt">Girl 6:&nbsp;&nbsp; It's so weird… could he be the demon's friend?</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; No… no I… (turns to SAN) Please say something.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;It's none of my business.</p>
<p>Kisuke comes running towards them, waving happily.</p>
<p class="txt">Kisuke: Everyone! Are you alright?</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Hey everyone, it's Brother Kisuke.</p>
<p class="txt">Girls:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Brother Kisuke…!</p>
<p>The girls gush and run to Kisuke excitedly.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; Well, there's nothing to worry about now. (to KIR) Right?</p>
<p>KIR mews.</p>
<p class="txt">Girl 7:&nbsp;&nbsp; We were so scared!</p>
<p class="txt">Girl 5:&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you, Brother Kisuke!</p>
<p class="txt">Girl 6:&nbsp;&nbsp; That pig was so disgusting!</p>
<p class="txt">Girl 5:&nbsp;&nbsp; That priest behaves like him too…</p>
<p>MIR sighs.</p>
