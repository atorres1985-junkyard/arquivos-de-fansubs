<li>While Kagome, Miroku and Sango changed into pyjamas, Inuyasha still preferred to sleep in his Robe of the Fire Rat. Talk about being on one’s toes at all time.</li>
<li>&quot;So you've shown your true self! You lecher monk!&quot;<br>       —Inuyasha<br>       It is rather out of character that Inuyasha would think so badly of Miroku.</li>
<li>This is one of the rare occasions when Miroku gropes Kagome even when Sango is around.</li>

<p>Evening under a gloomy overcast sky. INU-gang stands in a field.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(worried) Huh?! What's this?</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;It's a powerful miasma.</p>
<p>SHI and cute KIR huddle together. Something moves swiftly under the ground. KIR growls and transforms.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Be careful! The evil is coming closer.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (looks around apprehensively) Where is it?! Just hurry and show yourself!</p>
<p class="txt">The thing moves swiftly underground towards INU-gang.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;At your feet!</p>
<p>A large centipede bursts out from the ground and growls. It spews a torrent of acid at the group who dodges aside.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; What is that?! The ground is melting!</p>
<p>The centipede spews acid towards SHI.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(grabs SHI) Shippo!</p>
<p>The acid burns the ground that SHI was on. KAG, with SHI in her arms, gets onto KIR, who flies up and manage to dodge another acid attack.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; (points his staff) Why, you…! (jumps)</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;(running) Take this! Hiraikotsu! (holds HIR)</p>
<p>INU unsheathes a transformed TET.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Why, you…!</p>
<p>MIR jumps and hits the large centipede on the head with his staff. Red fumes are emitted from its head.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Finishing blow! (raise TET)</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Wait!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (stops suddenly) What?!</p>
<p>SAN is about to throw HIR but stop short when she hears KAG. MIR lands calmly.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(lands with KIR) It can't fight anymore.</p>
<p>The large centipede collapses behind MIR, who remains calm and suave.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (frustrated, shaking TET) Why?! I was just about to have a good fight!</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; It was just big, and not much else.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;(sighs) What a letdown. His appearance was so deceptive.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; (turns to the centipede and prays) But all's well and nothing could be better than that.</p>
<p>Further up, a group of villagers cheer loudly and happily.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; What's with them?</p>
<p>Among the villagers, a fat middle age man bows and walks towards MIR amicably.</p>
<p class="txt">Headman: (bows to MIR) Thank you so much, travelling monk. Our village has been tormented by that demon.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (shocked) By that demon?</p>
<p>KAG nudges INU in the elbow to shut him up.</p>
<p class="txt">Headman: We shall have a feast for you to show our gratitude.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; (examines the villagers which consists only of men, unattractive middle-age women, an old woman and a fat child, and makes a polite gesture to the headman) This was just part of my training. I must decline.</p>
<p class="txt">Headman: I see. But it's too bad. (touches his head in disappointment) The pretty girls of the village eagerly await you.</p>
<p>MIR's eyes suddenly become wide open.</p>
<p class="txt">Headman: (walking away) But if that is the case…</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; (runs in front of the headman and bows politely) Well, since you're being so kind, Buddha will punish me if I don't accept.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; (unimpressed) Changing his mind because of the young girls.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;He really is a lecher priest.</p>
<p>MIR smiles happily to the headman.</p>
<p class="txtb">[ End of ACT I: 4min 28sec ]</p><br>
<p class="txtb">[ Title screen: Farewell, Days of My Youth ]</p><br>
<p class="txtb">[ ACT II ]<a name="_ACT_II_"></a></p>
<p>In the headman's house. In a huge room, many tables are laid out. INU-gang and the entire village dine together. Cute KIR is chomping down her food.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;These beans are so delicious!</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; (eats gluttonously) It's so yummy! They're great! It's been so long since we've had such great food! What's the matter, Sango? You haven't touched your food.</p>
<p>SAN doesn't reply. She is staring at MIR, who is holding a palm of a pretty village girl.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Hmm… I can see in your palm that you will be blessed with children. (holds the girl's palm with both hands, in serious tone) Miss, will you bear my children?</p>
<p>The girl blushes. A small old woman pops out of nowhere, pushes the girl aside and grabs MIR's hands.</p>
<p class="txt">Old woman: Y-Yes!</p>
<p>MIR gasps and his face turns blue.</p>
<p class="txt">Old woman: I'll have as many as you want. Fifteen, sixteen… It makes no difference. Now then! (pulls MIR up and walks)</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; (struggles and looks behind him) H-Hey…Sango! Don't just sit there and watch! Help me!</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;(pouts and turns away from MIR) Why don't you father two, even three children? Just do as you please.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(in soft tone) Sango is scary!</p>
<p>INU continues eating.</p>
<p class="txt">Old woman: (pulls MIR across the room) Now, now!</p>
<p class="txt">Man:&emsp;&ensp;Old woman, you're always so healthy.</p>
<p class="txt">Old woman: I still can bear a child or two! (chuckles)</p>
<p>The villagers laugh among themselves happily.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(smiles) Even in this age, they had lively family communions. (to INU) That's nice to know.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (confused) What's a family communion?</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Well… Oh, moms, dads and grandparents and siblings all dining together and enjoying each other's company.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Huh…?</p>
<p>INU looks up and imagines a family communion. Screen fades to static surging. Zoom out to reveal SES and INU glaring at each other. They are seated across a table, eating a meal. SES takes the last meat with his chopstick. Static surge from both their eyes as they glare at each other. Fade to present. A sweat drop appears on INU's face as he grimaces.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; What's nice about that?!</p>
<p>INU shakes his head and shudders at the thought of a family communion with SES. He falls backwards and lie on the floor, letting out a loud exasperated sigh.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(chiding) Such bad manners! If you lie down right after eating, you'll end up a cow!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (spiteful) Who cares?!</p>
<p>A loud sucking sound is heard and INU slaps his face. He sits up and holds out his palm, revealing a flattened MYO. SHI and KAG huddle to INU out of curiosity.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Myoga!</p>
<p class="txt">MYO:&emsp; (fattens himself out and folds his arm) I was a bit concerned about you, Inuyasha. So I came…only to find you battling a giant centipede. I'm so glad you are okay.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (chiding) When the fighting's on, you're nowhere to be found. But you always appear at times like this. What a schemer you are!</p>
<p class="txt">MYO:&emsp; Oh, come now…</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Where've you been, anyway?</p>
<p class="txt">MYO:&emsp; (giggles to himself sheepishly) Even an old one like me has some secrets he'd prefer to keep.</p>
<p>MYO continues giggling to himself sheepishly and secretively. INU is disgusted.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (eyebrow twitching) You give me the creeps!</p>
<p>INU throws MYO over his shoulder. MYO lands on a lamp. He runs around the rim of the run frantically.</p>
<p class="txt">MYO:&emsp; Hot! Hot!</p><br>
<p>Late at night. INU-gang is asleep, the guys and girls in separate rooms. SHI is sleeping next to KAG.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; (talking in his sleep) I'm so full.</p>
<p>Along the corridor, MYO leaps cheerfully.</p>
<p class="txt">MYO:&emsp; Gamyo… Gamyo… Gamyo… (stops in front of a door and looks around cautiously) Quietly, silently…tippy tippy toe! (squeezes between the door)</p>
<p>In one of the rooms, MIR is sleeping with his back to the door. Footsteps are heard and someone stops in front of the door. MIR wakes.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; (thinking) There it comes.</p>
<p>The person slides open the door softly and enters the room.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; (thinking) I've heard of child spirits lingering on in an old mansion like this, but is that all that is?</p>
<p>The person stops behind MIR and shuffling of clothes are heard. MIR leaps out of his bed, raising his staff and yelling. Suddenly he gasps and falls over. The person turns out to be the headman's son, who raised his clothes in a peeing position.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; W-What's…!?</p>
<p class="txt">Boy:&emsp;&ensp; (sleep-talking) Wanna pee!</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; (throws his staff to the ground) Stop!</p>
<p class="txt">Boy:&emsp;&ensp; Gotta pee!</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; (grabs the boy) Wait! This is not the toilet!</p>
<p>MIR rushes out of the door. Cut to outside. MIR holds up the boy and makes 'Shee' sounds to help him pee. Cut to MIR going back to his room. He slides the door close and sighs.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; (tumbles back to bed) My goodness… What a way to be awakened.</p>
<p>MIR goes back to sleep with his back to the door. A while later, someone walks to the door and slides it open again. The person enters the room cautiously and stops behind MIR.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; You want to pee again? You can go by yourself, can't you?</p>
<p>The person doesn't move. MIR sits up in bed. The person turns out to be a sleepy looking SAN.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Sango… (looks around) Do you know what time it is? (smiles) She's come sneaking into my bed! Such luck! (pats his bed) Come and join me… (half lies down and smiles to SAN)</p>
<p>SAN doesn't say anything. She swings HIR downwards. MIR immediately leaps out of bed and bursts out of the door, crashing the door frames. SAN, still looking sleepy, chases MIR into the courtyard outside with HIR in her hands.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; (running) Don't tell me you're still angry about earlier?</p>
<p>SAN swings HIR and MIR dodges. It destroys the well in the courtyard instead.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; (running backwards and dodging HIR) The old woman was just joking!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (opens his door) What's all that ruckus?!</p>
<p>KAG opens her door and looks out too.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Sango! You don't have to be so angry!</p>
<p>SAN doesn't reply and continues swinging HIR violently at MIR. MIR is cornered to a wall. SAN stops and catches her breath. He notices SAN's sleepy eyes.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; She's sleepwalking…</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; (stands in the corridor, grabs KAG's pyjamas, sleepy) Cripes! Can't you be more quiet when you fight?</p>
<p>KAG and SHI turn around to go back to the room.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Wait!</p>
<p>INU and KAG stop and look at MIR sleepily.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Sango is possessed!</p>
<p>SAN raises HIR.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Stop, Sango!</p>
<p>KAG, SHI, KIR and INU run to SAN and MIR. SAN is about to attack MIR when INU grabs her arms from behind and stops her in time.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Stop it, Sango!</p>
<p>MIR is petrified and breaking out in sweat. SAN collapses and MIR catches hold of her.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Sango! (gropes SAN's butt) Are you all right?</p>
<p>SAN slaps MIR immediately. She wakes and looks at MIR.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Huh? Why am I here? (notices the slap mark on MIR's cheek) What happened, Miroku?</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; She slapped him before she came to…</p>
<p>A while later.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; There's no doubt that someone bewitched Sango.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;I don't remember a thing.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;But who would bewitch her?</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; I don't sense anything suspicious around here.</p>
<p class="txt">MYO:&emsp; (peeps out of MIR's pyjamas) A-Are you sure?</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Myoga! When did you hop into Miroku?</p>
<p class="txt">MYO:&emsp; Are you sure you don't sense anything suspicious?</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; I'll bet you're hiding something!</p>
<p class="txt">MYO:&emsp; (panicking) Err…no…</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;I remember… Long ago, my father told me of demons who realize their power for the first time after death.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; The most recent demon we destroyed was… Oh!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Then that weak giant centipede is the culprit?</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Then we must make sure it's permanently sealed again.</p>
<p>MYO looks around carefully and jumps out of MIR's pyjamas. He jumps onto KIR.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; What's the matter, Myoga?</p>
<p class="txt">MYO:&emsp; (hiding into KIR's tail) Nothing… It's nothing.</p><br>
<p>Dusk, at the burial mound of the large centipede. INU and MIR move away two large boulders on the mound and start shovelling till they hit the large centipede. SAN, KAG, SHI and KIR look on from the bottom of the mound.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; There.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; It's just a carcass.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Nothing scary about it.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; In any case, let's seal it with a sutra charm. (takes out a charm and puts it on the carcass)</p>
<p>Cut to the bottom of the mound. MYO is on KAG's palm, examining the palm lines carefully.</p>
<p class="txt">MYO:&emsp; Kagome, you don't have any luck with men.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;R-Really?</p>
<p class="txt">MYO:&emsp; Unless you leave your current fellow, you won't find peace or happiness.</p>
<p>KAG grimaces. MYO leaps onto SAN's palm.</p>
<p class="txt">MYO:&emsp; What about you, Sango? Hmmm… Let's see… Hmm… You're no better with men! You'd better forget about him. He's too much of a womanizer.</p>
<p>In the background, INU is struggling to heave the carcass of the centipede. MIR looks at the girls expressionlessly.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Your palm reading is right on the mark.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;T-Think so?</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; (turns to MIR) What? Are you done with sealing the demon?</p>
<p>KIR growls apprehensively.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; It's not over! Stop slacking, Miroku!</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; (suddenly looks fierce and runs towards the girls with raised staff) Why you! Unforgivable!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; What?!</p>
<p>The girls dodge MIR's attack. MIR continues to attack SAN.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;What're you doing?! Is this payback for earlier?</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (sprints towards MIR) So you've shown your true self! You lecher monk!</p>
<p>SAN tries hard to dodge MIR's violent attacks. MYO tries to hold onto SAN desperately.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;I didn't think you were such a man! I misjudged you!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; I always knew!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(chasing with KIR and SHI) That's not it! This time, the spirit of the centipede has possessed Miroku!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; No way! Miroku shows no signs of being possessed by such a strong power!</p>
<p>MIR swings his staff in SAN's direction, who dodges. Cute KIR runs to SAN's side and hisses at MIR angrily. MIR hits SAN who dodges again, and then tries to attack KIR in vain. KIR runs aside and SHI runs to her. MYO, who suddenly appears on KIR, leaps onto SHI.</p>
<p class="txt">MYO:&emsp; Shippo, run from here!</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; I don't need to be told that! Kirara!</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; (in weird tone) You won't get away! Halt! (chases SHI)</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;What?! What's going on?!</p>
<p>SHI runs away from MIR on KIR's back. MIR chases but suddenly trips and falls flat on his face.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; If I can't catch up to that little kid, this body is useless!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; What's with that accent, Miroku?!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;That's why I said he's possessed!</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Darn!</p>
<p>Something jumps out of MIR and escapes.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; (gasps and sits up) What was I doing?</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(kneels next to MIR) Miroku! Are you the real Miroku now?</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; What? What are you talking about? (gropes KAG's butt)</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(exasperated, angry) He has definitely returned to his old self, Inuyasha.</p>
<p>INU looms over MIR with folded arms. MIR grins embarrassedly at INU.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; That's for sure. (notices something behind) Wait! I feel something suspicious approaching.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Huh?</p>
<p>The ground behind SAN suddenly shakes. A giant centipede bursts out of the ground and growls.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; What's that?!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Could it be the mate of last night's centipede?</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Is this the one who possessed us?</p>
<p>The giant centipede spews acid at SAN, who dodges to the side. It then spews acid at KAG, INU and MIR. MIR runs off.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (grabs KAG) Kagome! (runs)</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Be careful! It's demon fluid!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (puts KAG on the ground gently and runs) Stay here!</p>
<p>KAG, taken aback by all the action, stares blankly.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (sprints towards the giant centipede and unsheathes TET) Take this! Wind Scar!</p>
<p>INU's Wind Scar slices the giant centipede into two. It growls and falls backwards. The sun has risen. INU sheathes TET.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;What a pesky centipede!</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Let's put a sutra charm on it.</p>
<p>A jumping sound is heard. INU stands still while MIR puts the charm on the carcass of the centipede.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; (hands in prayer position) Now, everything is settled.</p>
<p>INU suddenly lets down his hands and looks forward angrily. He growls as his eyes glow in a strange light. He starts to chuckle and then laugh hysterically.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Inuyasha…?</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Inuyasha?!</p>
<p>INU suddenly stops laughing and stares and SHI and KIR in the distance. KIR freezes up and her hair fuzzes. INU growls and leaps towards KIR on all fours. KIR starts to run away from INU.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Hold it! You won't get away!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Could Inuyasha be…?!</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;The way he's running…he looks like a flea.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Flea?!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Wait, I say!</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; (on KIR's back) This time, it's Inuyasha?! What's happening?!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Wait, Myoga!</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; Inuyasha is calling you!</p>
<p class="txt">MYO:&emsp; (peeps out of SHI's hair) That is not Master Inuyasha.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; What?</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Stop, I said!</p>
<p>INU makes a long leap and lands in front of KIR. KIR is shocked and stops short in her tracks. SHI is thrown of KIR and tumbles to INU's feet.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; I-Inuyasha!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (in feminine tone and smiling shyly) Don't think you can escape from me. (slides down his right sleeve to reveal his shoulder) My body is all yours.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; (shocked and panicking, waving arms madly) I-Inuyasha! Snap out of it!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (moves closer to SHI) You and I will get married.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; (backs away, crying) I still have my own dreams! I want to fall in love…and I want to declare my love!</p>
<p>INU grabs SHI's hair. KAG, MIR and SAN run to INU.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Inuyasha! Sit!</p>
<p>INU crashes face down to the ground.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (in normal tone, angry) What're you doing?! Kagome!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(glad) Inuyasha! You're back to normal!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Huh?</p>
<p>SHI is whimpering.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; What did I do?</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; (kicks INU madly) You stupid dog!</p>
<p>INU squints at SHI and presses his head to the ground. SHI struggles to break free.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; (examines INU closely) Inuyasha! What are you holding?</p>
<p>INU sits up and opens his clenched fist. MYO appears. INU pinches him with his fingers tightly.</p>
<p class="txt">MYO:&emsp; Please let me go!</p>
<p>KAG, INU, MIR &amp; SAN: (examines MYO closely) Myoga!</p>
<p class="txt">MYO:&emsp; Please let me go, Inuyasha!</p>
<p>A flea jumps out of INU's clothes and onto INU's hand.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; Kagome, it's a flea! An unfamiliar flea!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;You're right.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; It came out from Inuyasha's body.</p>
<p>The unfamiliar flea, with grey long hair, walks on INU's hand towards MYO.</p>
<p class="txt">MYO:&emsp; (struggling madly) This is my one wish of a lifetime! Please let me go!</p>
<p class="txt">Unfamiliar flea: Myoga! It's the end of the line for you. (grabs MYO's clothes) You cannot get away!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Who are you?</p>
<p>INU-gang scrutinizes the unfamiliar flea closely. The flea, noticing, whips out a comb and starts combing her hair.</p>
<p class="txt">Unfamiliar flea: Oh dear… This is so embarrassing. (keeps her comb and kowtows, smiling) I'm called Shoga. I'm betrothed to Myoga. Our parents arranged it.</p>
<p class="ttable">* Shoga abbreviated as SHO from now onwards. *</p>
<p class="txt">MYO:&emsp; (struggles even more) N-No, she's wrong!</p>
<p class="txt">SHO:&emsp; (fierce) You be quiet!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Old Shoga, huh?</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(nudges INU and whispers) Don't call her old!</p>
<p class="txt">SHO:&emsp; Oh, no… When a flea reaches my age, she wants to settle down and have a family. (turns to her side and closes her eyes sadly) But this one… (cries)</p>
<p>Cut to flashback to MYO leaping from pretty woman to pretty woman with Shoga watching at a distance on a cat</p>
<p class="txt">SHO:&emsp; (voice-over) From long ago, he's been such a womanizer! Whenever there's a pretty woman… He goes to check on her without a word… And he leaves without a trace.</p>
<p>Back to present. SHO turns and glares at MYO angrily.</p>
<p class="txt">SHO:&emsp; So I came after him this time, sworn to take him back even if I must carry him on my back!</p>
<p>SHO grabs MYO's clothes and MYO panics.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN &amp; MIR: Scary!</p>
<p class="txt">SHO:&emsp; Myoga, are you prepared?!</p>
<p class="txt">MYO:&emsp; No! Please let me! Please release me, Inuyasha!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; No way.</p>
<p class="txt">MYO:&emsp; Why?</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (raise MYO and glares at him) You knew that this Old Shoga was the one who bewitched us!</p>
<p>MIR and SAN gasp and glare at MYO in the same way.</p>
<p class="txt">MYO:&emsp; Inuyasha, do you intend to steal my days of youth?!</p>
<p class="txt">SHO:&emsp; (flares up, with her hairs standing on ends) What days of youth?! I think I'd better tie you to my back!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Good idea.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; (gentle) Now, now… Old Shoga. Forgive him.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Yes. If you're going to take Old Myoga's freedom, you should stay here and get married.</p>
<p>MYO and SHO blink at KAG. Then a pink cloud explodes around SHO and her face turns red. MYO starts to perspire.</p>
<p class="txt">SHO:&emsp; Marry?! (blushes and hides her face in her hands, shaking her head coyly)</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; (climbs onto INU's hands) Then you can start a life together!</p>
<p class="txt">SHO:&emsp; Oh dear… (draws circles on INU's hands embarrassedly)</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; She's embarrassed!</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;(smiles) She may be a flea, but she's still a female.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(excited) We'll ask the headman to be the go between.</p>
<p>INU smiles happily too. MYO struggles and yells.</p>
<p class="txt">MYO:&emsp; There's no need for the headman! No! No!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (squints at MYO) Myoga doesn't seem pleased about it.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; (firm and vengeful) You have to resign yourself.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;(firm and vengeful) Become a fine flea husband and wife.</p>
<p class="txt">MYO:&emsp; (cries STREAMS of tears) No…!</p>
<p>SHO is still drawing circles in INU's hands embarrassedly.</p>
<p class="txtb">[ End of ACT II: 20min 52sec ]</p><br>
<p class="txtb">[ ACT III ]<a name="_ACT_III_"></a></p>
<p>In the headman's house. The headman, formally dressed, sits next to MIR. A tea set is placed in front of them. KAG, SHI, INU and SAN are seated formally across them. Cute KIR walks into the room and everyone claps. SHO, in a Japanese wedding costume, is seated on KIR's head. MYO is seated next to her in a traditional costume too. His hat is hung low over his face.</p>
<p class="txt">SHO:&emsp; (shyly) Myoga… Now we are married at last! He's so embarrassed! (nudges MYO) You can at least say you love me.</p>
<p>MYO tumbles when SHO nudged him, and doesn't say anything.</p>
<p class="txt">SHO:&emsp; (raising her veil, suspicious) Myoga…?!</p>
<p>SHO yells loudly. INU-gang rush to her.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; What's wrong?</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;What happened?!</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Shoga?</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Old Shoga?</p>
<p>MYO turns out to be another dumb flea.</p>
<p class="txt">SHO:&emsp; (crying) This isn't Myoga! He switched places with some roving flea!</p>
<p>The flea gets out of his costume and leaps off KIR.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; That Myoga! He ran away!</p>
<p>Outside, a cat leaps onto the roof and stretches itself.</p>
<p class="txt">MYO:&emsp; Run! Run to the depths of Hell!</p>
<p>MYO sucks the cat. It freezes a little and runs off. Cut to interior.</p>
<p class="txt">SHO:&emsp; Why that old geezer! Wait! You won't get away! (leaps out and onto the roof, chasing MYO)</p>
<p>Outside the house, the cat is sprinting across a path.</p>
<p class="txt">MYO:&emsp; Run! Run!</p>
<p class="txt">SHO:&emsp; (chasing) Wait up!</p>
<p>Cut to INU-gang looking on.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; That flea! When it comes to running away, he's the best!</p>
<p>INU-gang sighs. Cut to the cat, MYO and SHO.</p>
<p class="txt">SHO:&emsp; Wait, Myoga!</p>
<p class="txt">MYO:&emsp; No way!</p>
