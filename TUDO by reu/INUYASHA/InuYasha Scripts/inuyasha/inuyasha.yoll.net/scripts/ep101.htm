<ul><li>Yuki-Onna<br>
  The snow demon or snow woman is actually a well-known character in Japanese mythology. Travellers in cold climates are always warned about this demon who appears as a beautiful young woman. The yuki-onna will seduce a man and when allowed to kiss him, would freeze him to death. Some stories tell of this demon as a helpless woman with a baby and asking travellers to keep it warm. This actually happens in the anime, when Miroku was seen coaxing snowballs to sleep. More info about the <a href="http://www.youkaimura.org/yukionna.htm" target="_blank">Yuki-Onna</a> can be found at <span class="contri">{Youkaimura}</span>. What is interesting is that some stories say that she'll only attack the truly evil, and may fall for kindhearted travellers, bearing children. These two different views of the Yuki-Onna probably gave premise for Koyuki to be splitted into two characters, a kind-hearted Koyuki, and an evil Snow Demon. </li>

<p>Cloudy in a heavy snowstorm blowing over the mountains. Young MIR is walking barefooted, struggling in the cold. He finally falls over and lose consciousness.</p>
<p class="txt">Voice:&nbsp; (background) Poor child… You must be lost in the snow.</p>
<p class="txt">Young MIR: (mumbling) Father…</p>
<p>A woman appears and puts her hand on young MIR's head. He wakes and she helps him up.</p>
<p class="txt">Woman: You're going to be alright now.</p>
<p class="txt">Young MIR: Who are you?</p>
<p class="txt">Woman: I'm Koyuki. Did something happen to your father?</p>
<p class="ttable">Koyuki abbreviated as KOY from now onwards.</p>
<p class="txt">Young MIR: (buries his head in KOY's chest) My father is dead. I'm homeless…</p>
<p class="txt">KOY:&emsp;&ensp;If you have nowhere to go, come to my place.</p>
<p>Young MIR looks at the woman's face clearly. She is very beautiful but looks very sad.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; (voice-over) Her skin was white as snow. She was a beautiful woman.</p>
<p><span class="txtb">CUT TO PRESENT </span>where SAN and MIR are sitting on a boulder by a river in the daytime. SAN suddenly slaps MIR across the cheek. A red slap mark appears and a mosquito flies away.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Why did you do that?</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;(concentrating) There was a mosquito on your cheek. (relaxes) And?</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; As I was saying, I was training to be a monk here. So I happen to know this area well.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Have you kept in touch with that woman?</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; No, not at all. It's been about seven years… (gropes SAN's butt) And I was just a cute child then.</p>
<p>SAN slaps MIR across the cheek again. MIR glares at her. She smiles and holds out her palm.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Look, I got it!</p><br>
<p class="txtb">[ Title screen: Seven Years Later: Lingering Snow ]</p><br>
<p>SAN and MIR walk next to a forest.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; That's…</p>
<p>Up ahead, an old man is shaking a young man who seems to have been buried in snow. A few other villagers are present too.</p>
<p class="txt">Old Man: Hang on! Wake up! Don't die!</p>
<p class="txt">Villager 1: You can do it!</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Snow? At this time of the year?</p>
<p class="txt">Old Man: Hey…!</p>
<p>The young man regains consciousness and he shivers.</p>
<p class="txt">Old Man: He's alive!</p>
<p class="txt">Villager 1: Thank goodness!</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Excuse me… What's happening? Please tell us, if you don't mind.</p>
<p class="txt">Old Man: Oh, Priest… There's been a snow demon around here lately.</p>
<p class="txt">Villager 1: Many male villagers have already fallen prey like this.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Would you go back to the hut and inform everyone?</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;What about you, Priest?</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; I'll go ensure that it'd no longer do such evil deeds. It's alright, the evil aura is not very strong. I'll be okay! (runs)</p>
<p class="txt">Villager 1: Priest is also a young man, I wonder if he'll be alright.</p>
<p class="txt">Old Man: The snow demon is a rare beauty with skin as white as snow.</p>
<p>SAN looks pensive.</p>
<p class="txt">Villager 1: Most men would be fooled by her beauty and go into a daze.</p>
<p>SAN runs after MIR.</p><br>
<p>Cut to INU and KAG on a hill. INU is looking at the view.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; I guess there's no clues regarding Naraku's whereabouts… So… (turns to KAG) What are you doing?</p>
<p>KAG is taking firecrackers out of her bag and lining them on the ground.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;I found this while I was packing my bag. I brought them so that we can have fun with them. But I totally forget about them. (lights a firework) Just thought I'd check to see they'd become damp.</p>
<p>The cracker burns with a pretty firework.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (excited) What is that?!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Fireworks. They're fireworks. (smiles) Aren't they pretty?</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; I see…</p>
<p>Suddenly, it starts snowing.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Snowing at this time of the year? Why…?</p><br>
<p>Cut to SAN running along a river. It starts to snow too. She stops and looks up, surprised.</p><br>
<p>Cut to SAN trudging in a snowstorm. She loses a footing and half her body gets buried in the snow. She looks around to find a way to get out when she sees MIR nearby. He is unconscious and seated in a pile of snow.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Priest?! (shouts) Priest! Priest!!</p>
<p>A woman glides towards MIR.</p>
<p class="txt">Woman: Mister… You seem to be having some trouble… Is there anything I can do to help?</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; (wakes, weakly) Yes… Lady… (reaching out) Will you bear my child…?</p>
<p>The woman removes her straw hat. It is KOY, who saved young MIR seven years ago. She has not aged.</p>
<p class="txt">KOY:&emsp;&ensp;(smiles) Have you forgotten? I've already had your child.</p>
<p>MIR is stupefied. SAN gasps and blushes.</p>
<p class="txt">KOY:&emsp;&ensp;(helps MIR up) Won't you see him? (walks with MIR)</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Where are you going, Priest? Priest! Priest!!</p>
<p>KOY and MIR continue walking, oblivious to SAN's cries. The snowstorm gets heavier.</p><br>
<p>Cut to a hut in the snow. A few fishes are being roasted by a fire. SHI and cute KIR are waiting. KIR growls.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; Kirara, let's share, okay?</p>
<p>KIR mews.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; Those who do not work, don't deserve food! We don't have to share this with them!</p>
<p>INU and KAG walk in.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; That looks really good!</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; (scowls) You're cheap. You came back because you smelled fish!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (brushes some snow off his clothes) Come on, it's snowing heavily.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; (taken aback and shivers) I thought it was getting cold…</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Where's Sango and Miroku?</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; They're not back yet.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (sits down by the fire and takes a fish) They'll come back when they get hungry. (eats)</p>
<p>Cute KIR growls.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; (worked up) The fishes are for Kirara and me!!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Don't be so stingy. Have some too, Kagome. It's good.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(looks out of the hut, worried) O-okay.</p>
<p>A couple wearing straw hats run towards the hut.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(runs out of the hut, glad) Sango! Miroku!</p>
<p>The couple turns out to be a hunter and his wife. All three of them are surprised.</p><br>
<p>Cut to inside of hut. Sticks of meat are roasting over the fire. SHI, KIR, INU, KAG and the couple sit around the fire.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Sorry for entering your house without permission.</p>
<p class="txt">Hunter: It doesn't matter, it's snowing so heavily anyway.</p>
<p class="txt">Wife:&emsp; That's a wild boar meat. It'll warm you up.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (eats a stick of meat) This is good!</p>
<p class="txt">Wife:&emsp; It's still raw!</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; (frowns) He's cheap that's why!</p>
<p>KIR mews.</p>
<p class="txt">Wife:&emsp; Anyway, you should not leave this area until that snow woman leave.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Snow woman?</p>
<p class="txt">Wife:&emsp; Yes. When a young man is walking outside alone, he'll be stopped by a young woman. Once he stumbles after her, that's the end. He'll be found the next day in an awful frozen lump.</p>
<p class="txt">Hunter: (nods) It's said that this woman's skin is as white as snow. She's supposedly a rare beauty.</p>
<p>The wife glares at the hunter.</p>
<p class="txt">Hunter: (oblivious) I'd like to see her once, even if I become frozen.</p>
<p>The wife scowls and pinches the hunter's butt. He winces.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(stands) Miroku is in danger!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Don't worry… Sango is with him, right?</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Oh, that's okay then…</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; You guys don't get it, do you? Miroku wouldn't leave a woman like that alone. Just think about what Sango will do to him… (frightened) What a scary thought!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Why?</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Isn't it obvious?! Miroku is Sango's…</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; It's useless! It's not like our advices ever got through to him.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(pauses and sighs) You're right.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (stands) Still, if that demon had showed up due to Naraku's absence, we can't let it be. I'll go check! (runs out of hut)</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Inuyasha, I'll go with you!</p>
<p class="txt">Hunter: Wait! (holds up a gourd) Take this with you. It's a restorative potion.</p><br>
<p>Cut to INU, KAG and large KIR searching in the snow covered mountains. SHI is sitting on KIR.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Miroku!!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Sango!</p>
<p>KIR sniffs a pile of snow and growls. She starts digging.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; What's wrong, Kirara?</p>
<p>KIR digs away some snow to reveal SAN under it.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; (gasps) Everyone!</p>
<p>INU and KAG run towards SAN as KIR pulls her out.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Sango!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Sango! Drink this, it's a restorative potion! (pours some potion into SAN's mouth) I heard it's good for warming up the body!</p>
<p>SAN takes a few gulps and she wakes.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; (awe) It works!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Apparently, it's made of vipers, lizards, and caterpillars in distilled spirits.</p>
<p>SAN freezes and she face turns green. She crawls swiftly to a pile of snow and pukes.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(grimaces) I'm glad she's better…</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; What about Miroku?</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;(gasps) Priest!</p>
<p><span class="txtb">CUT TO FLASHBACK </span>from earlier on, when KOY picked up MIR.</p>
<p class="txt">KOY:&emsp;&ensp;Have you forgotten? I've already had your child. Won't you see him?</p>
<p class="txtb">END OF FLASHBACK.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;(clenches fist angrily) By now… I bet the three of them are living together as a happy family!</p>
<p class="txt">All:&emsp;&emsp; Huh?</p>

<p>KOY is holding onto MIR's hand as they walk in a snow-covered bamboo forest.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; (dazed) Barrier…</p>
<p>They come to a large mansion.</p>
<p class="txt">KOY:&emsp;&ensp;Come with me, my Lord.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; (thinking) This woman is not of this world. But, why does she seek to harm humans? Does she intend to captivate men and rob them of their life force?</p>
<p>MIR and KOY enter the mansion. A large group of toddlers rush towards MIR.</p>
<p class="txt">Boy 1:&nbsp; (jump into MIR's arms) Welcome home, Father!</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; (shocked) This is…</p>
<p class="txt">KOY:&emsp;&ensp;Please take care of the children, dear. I'll go prepare the bath.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; But…</p>
<p>MIR holds up Boy 1, who pees onto his face and laughs.</p>
<p class="txt">KOY:&emsp;&ensp;Diapers are over there.</p><br>
<p>Cut to a large room in the mansion. Some babies are wrapped up and sleeping in baskets. Three piles of diaper-cloth are on the ground. MIR takes one and wipes his face.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Still, who are these children? (sighs)</p>
<p class="txt">KOY:&emsp;&ensp;(looms behind MIR) You do not meant to say…</p>
<p>MIR is taken aback.</p>
<p class="txt">KOY:&emsp;&ensp;That you've forgotten, right? They are your children.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; (sweat drop, thinking) Mine…? So many?</p><br>
<p>Cut to the rest of INU-gang running in the bamboo forest.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;I heard it with my own ears! They're his children!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; I guess it's his day of reckoning! It might be good for him to settle down around here!</p>
<p>SAN glares at INU.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; Idiot!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(chiding) You two! We shouldn't believe what a demon says!</p>
<p>A barrier appears along the path further up. INU-gang stops.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Barrier?</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;The evil aura is coming from there.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (unsheathes TET) I'll break it!</p>
<p>TET turns red. INU leaps and cuts the barrier apart.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Now!</p>
<p>INU-gang runs through the barrier, which closes after them.</p><br>
<p>Cut to inside of mansion. MIR is carrying a baby on his back as he does the laundry. Two more babies roll around the ground near him. They are all crying.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; (gentle) Alright now. There, there… (gasps) Don't blow your nose on my clothes!</p>
<p>Two toddlers run past MIR, riding on his scepter like how witches ride on brooms.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Hey, my scepter is not a toy!</p>
<p class="txt">KOY:&emsp;&ensp;Priest.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Yes?</p>
<p>KOY is seated across MIR, putting the babies to sleep.</p>
<p class="txt">KOY:&emsp;&ensp;Please bathe Yosaku also. Sutematsu needs a new diaper too. And, please sing a lullaby to put Otora to sleep.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Yes, right away.</p>
<p>Cut to MIR piggybacking a baby.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Alright now, don't cry.</p>
<p>Cut to MIR feeding another baby.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Now, doesn't that taste good?</p>
<p>Cut to MIR feeding a baby. (Sutematsu?)</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Let's get your diaper changed.</p>
<p>Cut to MIR singing a lullaby to a toddler in his arms (Otora?).</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; (points) Hey, don't pee over there!</p>
<p>Boy 1, about to pee on the ground, looks up.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; (runs) The bathroom is that way!</p>
<p>After awhile, MIR finally sits down to take a rest. KOY wipes the perspiration off his forehead.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Thank you. Have you been taking care of them by yourself?</p>
<p class="txt">KOY:&emsp;&ensp;Any mother would do the same thing.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Still, are all of them, mine?</p>
<p class="txt">KOY:&emsp;&ensp;Children who lost their parents to war, as well as those who had to part with their parents after birth.</p>
<p>Cut to the children sleeping peacefully.</p>
<p class="txt">KOY:&emsp;&ensp;Their numbers just grew after I began taking care of such children.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; It must be hard on you…</p>
<p class="txt">KOY:&emsp;&ensp;(sad) All of them are really pitiful…</p>
<p>MIR looks at KOY.</p><br>
<p>Cut to INU-gang in the bamboo forest.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Be careful, she's close.</p>
<p>MIR's singing of a lullaby is heard in the background.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;That's Miroku singing!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; I guess even a guy like him cares about his kids.</p>
<p>SAN clenches her fist furiously.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(furious) Inuyasha!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Huh?</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; Look at that!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;A mansion?</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; That's where he is!</p><br>
<p>Cut to MIR in the courtyard of the mansion. He looks at a baby in his arms.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; It's sleeping soundly. (turns around) There, there.</p>
<p>Cut to SHI, SAN, KAG and INU peeping through some holes in the door. The mansion looks dilapidated now.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; You're a good child, grow up quickly!</p>
<p>SAN clenches her teeth angrily. MIR turns around and SAN gasps.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Oh, there, there. There, there.</p>
<p>Pan out to reveal MIR holding two balls of snow in his arms, looking dazed.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;That's…!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Miroku is under a spell.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (scoffs and jumps onto the wall of the mansion) Wake up, Miroku!</p>
<p>MIR is oblivious to INU's yells. He continues hugging the snow balls.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (jumps) Miroku!!</p>
<p>Suddenly a mini snow storm gathers and throws INU out of the mansion.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN &amp; KAG: Inuyasha!</p>
<p>SAN, KAG and SHI run to INU. The mini snow storm stops to reveal KOY.</p>
<p class="txt">KOY:&emsp;&ensp;You people… This place is out of bounds… (pauses and looks at KAG's pockets) Oh…Sacred Jewel fragments? Come, snow leopard!</p>
<p>A snow storm appears and reveals a large prehistoric looking leopard with huge fangs. Large KIR hisses. The leopard hisses back. KIR is slightly frightened and her ears flop.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; In this cold, it'd be a tough fight for us.</p>
<p class="txt">KOY:&emsp;&ensp;Defeat them and take their Sacred Jewel fragments!</p>
<p>The snow leopard runs towards to group.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; I'll cut you in half!!</p>
<p>INU jumps and cuts the leopard in half.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (smug) Got it! What a weak opponent.</p>
<p>Behind him, the leopard joins back and pounces towards INU. SHI and SAN gasp. KAG runs in front of INU and draws an arrow.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Inuyasha!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (shocked that KAG is pointing an arrow in his direction) What?!</p>
<p>The leopard closes in on INU. KAG fires. INU ducks and the arrow hits a fang of the leopard.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Inuyasha, run!</p>
<p>The leopard slams a paw on INU who dodges. The fang that KAG broke grows back.</p><br>
<p>Cut to inside of mansion. MIR is putting a baby to sleep.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Oh, there, there…</p>
<p>KOY glides past the room.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Excuse me…</p>
<p class="txt">KOY:&emsp;&ensp;Yes?</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; There seemed to be a commotion outside. Did something happen?</p>
<p class="txt">KOY:&emsp;&ensp;(smiling) Some stray dogs wandered in. You don't need to worry about it. They'll leave soon…</p><br>
<p>Cut to outside. The snow leopard leaps and slams INU, causing him to crash through the roof and into the roof where MIR is.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; The children!</p>
<p>The sun shines through the hole in the roof and MIR recovers from his dazed expression.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Miroku!!</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; (shocked) Inuyasha!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (yells) Regain your senses!</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; I never lost them in the first place!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Take a good look!</p>
<p>MIR looks around the room. All the children are actually snow balls.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; This is…!</p>
<p>KOY suddenly appears and spews ice at INU and MIR, who dodge.</p>
<p class="txt">KOY:&emsp;&ensp;I will not let you go.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; (looks at KOY sadly) You… You look just like someone in my memories… (frowns) I do not wish to do anything to you, but…</p>
<p>MIR takes out a charm and throws it at KOY. She yells in pain as she looks her looks and turns back into a snow demon.</p><br>
<p>Cut to KAG running away from the leopard with SHI under her arms.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; No!!! Don't eat me! I don't taste good at all!</p>
<p>KAG trips and falls.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Hiraikotsu!</p>
<p>SAN throws HIR at the leopard who dodges.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;That's fast…</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (jumps out) Let me handle it! Wind Scar!!</p>
<p>INU throws a Wind Scar at the leopard, who dodges it effortlessly.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; It got away!</p><br>
<p>Back in the mansion with KOY and MIR.</p>
<p class="txt">KOY:&emsp;&ensp;(sad) Hate… Hate…</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Why does someone as kind as you ensnare men and do bad things?</p>
<p class="txt">KOY:&emsp;&ensp;Hate… I hate this world. (falls to her knees) I hate the fact that I was born in this world! I hate…! (tears)</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; You should accept it and go on to the afterlife.</p>
<p>MIR raises his scepter and pauses.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Forgive me!</p>
<p>MIR swings his scepter down at KOY. She shrieks and becomes pieces of snow. Light orbs float out from KOY's snow and the children's.</p><br>
<p>Cut to courtyard. The light orbs float towards the snow leopard and enter its body. The leopard throbs.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; What? What's going on with that thing?!</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; (rushes out) Use heat! They're susceptible to heat and fire!</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; Alright, I'll use my Fox Fire! (jumps and throws fox fire at leopard) Here! Take that!</p>
<p>The fire burns the leopard face for a while and extinguishes. The leopard, furious, chases SHI.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; (wailing) It didn't work at all!!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;I know! (looks at the restorative potion on her waist) I can use this…</p>
<p>Cut to KAG on KIR in the air.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(yells to leopard) This way! I'm the one you're after!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Kagome!</p>
<p>The leopard chases KAG and KIR, who are flying higher. KAG throws down the gourd of restorative potion.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Hiraikotsu!</p>
<p class="txt">SAN throws HIR which smashes the gourd. The potion flows onto the leopard's back. KAG then fires an arrow with static, causing the potion to catch fire. The leopard winces in pain as the potion burns its back.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Now! Wind Scar!!</p>
<p>INU then throws a Wind Scar at the leopard and it disintegrates completely to form an image of KOY.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; Is that a snow demon as well?</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; I'll kill her!</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Wait! (pauses) That soul is no longer possessed by the snow demon.</p>
<p>The image of KOY bows to MIR and disappears. MIR looks on. He then closes his eyes and sighs.</p><br>
<p>Cut to INU-gang standing around gravestone with offerings placed on the ground. MIR offers a prayer.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; That was the soul of a young woman who lost her life during a war. She had been taking care of the souls of children who had been unfortunate and lost their lives. A snow demon must have possessed her soul.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;(sad) How tragic…</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;I wonder if the Warring States Era is too harsh for a woman to live in…</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Still, why did you follow her when she told you she has your child? You must have believed that it was possible, right?!</p>
<p>SAN's face contorts and she clenches her fists.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Inuyasha!</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; He's an idiot really.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; (stands) That is…</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Priest deliberately fell under the demon's spell in order to save her.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (disbelief) Huh?!</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; (serious) That's right! Damn right.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Priest would never make such a mistake. Right? (slaps MIR and holds up her palm) Another mosquito.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Mosquito?</p>
<p>There is a short pause.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Why don't we get going?</p>
<p class="txt">The rest of INU-gang moves along with SAN.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; (thinking) She looked like the woman in my memories… But, the person who saved me when I was just a child…</p>
<p><span class="txtb">CUT TO FLASHBACK </span>of KOY piggybacking young MIR in the snow seven years ago.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR: 	(voice-over) Lady Koyuki… She must be living happily somewhere.</p>
<p><span class="txtb">BACK TO PRESENT.</span> A snowflake floats down in front of MIR.</p>

<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; Rumors have it that Naraku is hiding in the Northern mountains. The Wolf Demons Tribe there have suddenly been attacked!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;The one who has been terrorizing them is Kyokotsu!</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; That guy…! Has he been resurrected from his grave?!</p>
