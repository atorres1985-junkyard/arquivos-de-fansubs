Kikyo is still alive. Back then, it was because someone wanted to make use of her priestess powers and revived her. However, being made from clay, she doesn't have warmth. Instead she falls into a dark and evil world. Inuyasha, run! Kikyo wants to take your life! No, Kikyo! Your enemy isn't Inuyasha! Next episode, 'Kagome's Voice and Kikyo's Kiss'!</p>
<p class="header"><a name="1"></a>'Adult Swim' Synopsis</p>
<p>Inuyasha searches the riverbank for any signs of Kikyo, and finds her ribbon. Kagome, magically bound by Kikyo, tries to explain that Naraku was the one responsible for Kikyo's death, not Inuyasha. Kikyo no longer cares, saying she cannot overcome the deep hatred she has harboured for him.</p>

<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Huh? (looks down) Inuyasha set out to find you. (thinking) I see… Inuyasha is trying to come here.</p>
<p class="txt">KIK:&emsp;&ensp; What are you to Inuyasha?</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Huh?</p>
<p>KIK puts a finger on KAG's forehead and she freezes.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(shocked, thinking) My body…can't move!</p>
<p class="txt">KIK:&emsp;&ensp; You are in the way.</p><br>
<p>INU runs in a forest. The soul collectors fly past him.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; T-that's…! The demons who were gathering the dead souls! (sees them enter the barrier, thinking) A barrier… Kikyo is behind this… Kikyo, is it really you?!</p><br>
<p>Back with KIK and KAG. KAG is tied up to the tree with the soul collectors enveloping her.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(thinking) I can't move.</p>
<p>A soul collector brings a soul to KIK.</p>
<p class="txt">KIK:&emsp;&ensp; Inuyasha is here.</p>
<p>Cut to the barrier dissolves in front of INU. Back to KIK.</p>
<p class="txt">KIK:&emsp;&ensp; Not to save you. He's here to see me. (frowns) I won't allow any interference.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Interference? You don't still mean to kill Inuyasha?! No, Kikyo! Someone purposely set you two at odds! It wasn't Inuyasha who killed you!</p>
<p class="txt">KIK:&emsp;&ensp; (scoffs) You look as though you expect me to be happy.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Huh?</p>
<p class="txt">KIK:&emsp;&ensp; The one who caused my death… If that person dies, will I be resurrected?</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;T-that's…</p>
<p class="txt">KIK:&emsp;&ensp; The dead wish for one thing… To live once more. Hah! A wish that cannot come true. However, the dead can wish for one thing which can come true. I want to steal his heart from the one I will never forgive if he dares to forget me.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Never forgive if he forgets you? Do you mean Inuyasha?</p>
<p class="txt">KIK:&emsp;&ensp; He wishes for my death. That is good. That means he has regrets about our fight. (laughs) Regret all he wants. I shall never let him forget…about me. Time will not go forward. Then I can exist in the time that is frozen. I will be able to continue living in his heart.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Even now, Inuyasha thinks about you! Isn't that enough? Inuyasha loves you! He always has! Isn't that enough?</p>
<p class="txt">KIK:&emsp;&ensp; Inuyasha and I parted despising each other. The love you speak of is but a shallow emotion which only served to deepen the hatred. Nothing is stronger in strengthening revolve than bitterness. If he must love, then love my consuming hatred. As for me, I will love his heart which is about to fall into deep despair.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;No! Your hatred is pointless! It makes no sense!</p>
<p>INU appears. He stares at KIK in disbelief.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Inuyasha! Talk to Kikyo! Tell her how Naraku deceived you both!</p>
<p>INU walks to KIK.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Inuyasha?</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (softly) Kikyo…</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(gasps, thinking) Inuyasha can't see me!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; So it is you who's been gathering the souls of dead women.</p>
<p class="txt">KIK:&emsp;&ensp; This body, molded from earth and bones, needs to be nourished with human souls, else I cannot move. Inuyasha…you must despise me. Driven by my hatred towards you, I have gathered the souls of the dead to remain in this world.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (shouts) How stupid! You may hate me, but… never a day went by without my thinking about you!</p>
<p>KIK look at INU sadly.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(thinking) I thought so… Inuyasha has never forgotten Kikyo… Of course! But I feel a bit sad. Inuyasha's been taken from me. Oh, what am I saying?! Inuyasha's not my boyfriend or anything!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; No matter what your appearance, I would never hate you or think less of you…</p>
<p class="txt">KIK:&emsp;&ensp; Is that true? (touches INU's face) Even if I were to kill you with these hands?</p>
<p>KIK kisses INU.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(blushing) Huh?! W-wait…!</p>
<p class="txt">KIK:&emsp;&ensp; (hugs INU) Inuyasha…after meeting you, I stopped being a priestess. I became a mere woman. This is what I longed for when I was alive.</p>
<p>INU hugs KIK back.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Inuyasha… You're going to accept her… I guess…it's only to be expected. What am I doing here anyway? I'm such a fool! I'm starting to cry!? Cripes…what?!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (thinking) This nostalgic scent of her… It's just like back then. The only difference is that she has no warmth. Her body died…so it's cold…and sad…and lonely.</p>
<p class="txt">KIK:&emsp;&ensp; We cannot return to that time. So I want to stay like this a little longer.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; I can't save you… If I cannot do anything for you…to stay like this… How I wish time would stop!</p>
<p class="txt">KIK:&emsp;&ensp; Is that all right? If time would stop?</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Yeah…I don't care…if I'm with you. (closes his eyes)</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Oh, I can't watch this anymore! I won't interfere, so release me! I'll go far away. Hey, are you two listening?!</p>
<p>The ground below INU and KIK suddenly cracks and souls are sucked into the hole. KIK and INU sinks into the ground slowly.</p>
<p class="txt">KIK:&emsp;&ensp; Inuyasha…I will never let you go. Come with me to hell.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;He's being dragged in! Inuyasha, what're you doing?! You must get away! (thinking) No! He's unconscious! (shouts) Kikyo! You can hear me, I know! You coward! Inuyasha said he wants to be with you but he never said he wanted to die with you! Unlike you, Inuyasha must go after Naraku who tricked him fifty years ago! More than anything, Inuyasha wants to live to fight! Inuyasha is determined to avenge your death as well!</p>
<p>KIK looks at KAG fiercely.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;You understand?</p>
<p>KIK sends a current at KAG.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(slides into a sitting position) Kikyo…</p>
<p class="txt">KIK:&emsp;&ensp; Will getting revenge bring this body back to life?! (to INU) Inuyasha… Rather than live with my memory, come with me. (INU and KIK sink lower into the ground) You and I have the same wish.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(clenches her fists) How dare you! If Inuyasha were conscious, he would never follow you! No way! Get away from Inuyasha! (fierce) Do…not…touch…Inuyasha!</p>
<p>KIK's heart suddenly throbs faster and louder. She gasps her chest in pain while souls rush out of her body.</p>
<p class="txt">KIK:&emsp;&ensp; (stares at KAG, thinking) This girl… She's taking my souls once again! Before this body is completely emptied… (to INU) Inuyasha! Come!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;No! Wake up, Inuyasha! Inuyasha! Inuyasha!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (wakes, thinking) Kagome's voice… (speaks slowly) Kagome…is…here? (notices KAG) Kagome? Kagome!</p>
<p>INU pushes KIK away and leaps to KAG. KIK looks at INU sadly.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (slashes the soul collectors enveloping KAG) Kagome! What're you doing here?</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Huh!? What about you?</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Me? Well…err…</p>
<p>The soul collectors rush to KIK.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (turns to KIK) Kikyo!</p>
<p class="txt">KIK:&emsp;&ensp; Is that girl more dear to you?</p>
<p>INU is lost for words. INU and KAG look at each other, blushes and look down hurriedly.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Huh…uh…</p>
<p>KIK float up into the sky with her soul collectors.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Wait, Kikyo! I…!</p>
<p class="txt">KIK:&emsp;&ensp; Inuyasha, do not forget. My feeling when my lips were against yours…was real. Do not forget.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Kikyo…</p>
<p>KIK floats higher up and disappears. KAG gets up and walks off stiffly.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; H-hey! (walks after KAG)</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Don't come!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; What're you so mad about?</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;You know, Inuyasha, do you think you can find the Sacred Jewels alone? I…don't think I can help you anymore.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; What're you saying?! You're the only one who can see the Jewels. Of course, you have to help!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;That's all, right? That's all you need me for. What a thing to say. Sorry! Forget I said that. Maybe it's because I'm alone in this strange world. I'm feeling lonely.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; I'm here! You have me, don't you?!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Inuyasha… I get it. You couldn't see me, could you?</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Huh?</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;I'm sorry, but I did see it all.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; See it all?</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;From the start to finish. So, please leave me alone for a while. (walks off)</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; H-hey! What's this about… Start to finish?! Kagome! What did I do? (confused and chases KAG) Hey! Kagome! Tell me!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(stops) Sit!</p>
<p>INU falls flat faced on the ground.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(fierce) Start to finish means everything! I saw everything! From a front row seat! I'm leaving. (walks off)</p>
<p>SHI and MIR appear a distance behind INU.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; What? You found her? (walks to INU) Inuyasha? What're you doing here? Have you seen Kagome?</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; (looks at INU who's been 'sit') I've seen that pose before. It must mean that Kagome is just fine.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; And that Kagome is full of energy.</p><br>
<p>In KAE's hut. KAE wakes from her sleep and notices something. KIK enters the hut.</p>
<p class="txt">KAE:&emsp;&ensp;(gets up) Sister Kikyo!</p>
<p class="txt">KIK:&emsp;&ensp; What's the matter, Kaede? Are you afraid of your own sister?</p>
<p class="txt">KAE:&emsp;&ensp;N-no… Since the day you fell from the cliff, I thought…</p>
<p class="txt">KIK:&emsp;&ensp; Yes, I am a dead woman. But I guess I still long for this world.</p>
<p class="txt">KAE:&emsp;&ensp;Do you still seek Inuyasha's life?</p>
<p class="txt">KIK:&emsp;&ensp; I just met Inuyasha moments ago. And I barely missed killing him. Tell me, Kaede. (sits down) Tell me everything you know about this Naraku.</p>
<p><span class="txtb">Flashback</span> from episode 21 when ONI fed his body to demons.</p>
<p class="txt">ONI:&emsp;&nbsp; My rotten spirit has some use after all. Doesn't it look good? Don't you want to devour me? I want a body that moves freely. In order to possess the Sacred Jewel and Kikyo. Now eat me! And pass on power…to me!</p>
<p class="txt">KAE:&emsp;&ensp;(voice-over) Everything started from the evil designs of Onigumo. He called forth the demons and was eaten by them, thus was born the demon Naraku.</p>
<p class="txtb">Back to present.</p>
<p class="txt">KIK:&emsp;&ensp; I see… That wild robber.</p>
<p class="txt">KAE:&emsp;&ensp;(thinking) Yes. He used to say that the Sacred Jewel grows in beauty when it is tainted.</p>
<p class="txt">KIK:&emsp;&ensp; He caused hatred between myself and Inuyasha, then stole the Jewel that had been sullied.</p>
<p class="txt">KAE:&emsp;&ensp;My sister…Inuyasha was seriously wounded by Naraku again. So…</p>
<p class="txt">KIK:&emsp;&ensp; (walking out of hut) I just thought I should know the circumstances of my death. (stops and turns to KAE) By the way, Inuyasha has changed. His face had a softness. Back then, he trusted no one…his eyes were cold.</p>
<p class="txt">KAE:&emsp;&ensp;Kagome is a strange child. She has been able to slowly heal Inuyasha's heart.</p>
<p class="txt">KIK:&emsp;&ensp; That girl again… She's the one who changed him. (thinking) If I had lived, I would have been the one to heal his heart.</p>
<p class="txt">KAE:&emsp;&ensp;My sister…are you not able to break away from the past?</p>
<p class="txt">KIK:&emsp;&ensp; We shall meet again. (walks out)</p>
<p>KAE looks down. Cut to KIK standing in a boat, the soul collectors flying next to her.</p>
<p class="txt">KAE:&emsp;&ensp;(voice-over) How long will you linger… Sister?</p>

<p>Daytime. KAG walks towards the Dry well, in a daze. She trips over a rock and is about to kick it angrily, but suddenly stops and walks off. INU, SHI and MIR look at her from behind a log. KAG jumps into the well.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; She's gone. Inuyasha, Kagome wasn't her usual self. Just what happened with Kikyo?</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; What you always do with women…</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; (gasps) Huh?! (shocked) You! You participated in such an act in front of Kagome?!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Whaddya usually do?!</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Huh?</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; Will Kagome come back? She seemed to be quite troubled.</p>
<p>INU looks down, deep in thoughts. <span class="txtb">Flashback </span>of his encounter with KIK.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Never a day went by without my thinking of you!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (voice-over) I spoke the truth.</p>
<p>KIK kisses INU.</p>
<p class="txt">KIK:&emsp;&ensp; (voice-over) My feeling when my lips were against yours…was real.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (voice-over) And my words were real.</p>
<p class="txt">KIK:&emsp;&ensp; Is that girl more dear to you?</p>
<p class="txtb">Back to present.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Now then, what will you do, Inuyasha? Kikyo could not have gone far. Will you go after her?</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; Hey! Isn't Kagome more precious? Inuyasha, hurry and make up with her!</p>
<p>INU doesn't reply. Cut to the bottom of the well. KAG appears.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;What's the matter with me? I was in such a daze, I forgot all my things back there. (shouts) Hey, is anyone there?</p>
<p>The gang doesn't hear and their conversation can be heard in the well.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; What will you do, Inuyasha?</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; Who will you choose?!</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Now then!</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; Well?!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Can't I choose both?</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; You…two-timing…!</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; (pats INU's shoulder understandingly) Well, it often happens with men. However, no matter what happens, she must not find out. If what you just said should ever leak out…</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(yells) Sit!</p>
<p>INU crash on the ground.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Yes, it's sit.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; It means divine punishment for you.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Poor Inuyasha… He wasn't being malicious.</p>
