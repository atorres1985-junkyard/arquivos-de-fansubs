<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; It's now time for Inuyasha!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;To find the Sacred Jewel fragments,</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; I have to defeat Naraku with this Tetsusaiga!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Kikyo had been killed by Naraku. Naraku’s baby is trying to attack the void within our hearts. Inuyasha has gone in search of Kikyo, and he can’t save me…</p>

<p class="txtb"><a name="AI"></a>[ ACT I ]</p>
<p>Recap from previous episode. KAG is holding Akago in her arms. KAG gradually closes her eyes. An image of INU running away is seen, ignoring KAG's pleads.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Help! Help me, Inuyasha!</p>
<p>Back to present. KAG seems to be losing consciousness.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Inuyasha is looking for Kikyo. He wants to know her whereabouts. He won't come to save me. (thinking) Inuyasha…</p>
<p class="txt">Akago:	(thinking) I found it. (speaking) I have grasped the darkness of your heart. Embrace me now. Our souls will become one, and you'll be my eyes.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(hugs Akago, thinking) Inuyasha!</p>
<p>KAG closes her eyes. She opens them again, looking forlorn.</p>

<p class="txtb">[ Title screen: Changing Heartache into Courage ]</p>
<br>
<p>Continuation from previous episode. MIR and SAN are fending off the guards.</p>
<p class="txt">Guard 1: Go to hell! (raises staff)</p>
<p>MIR knocks Guard 1 in the stomach, who falls to the ground. More guards rush at them.</p>
<p class="txt">Guard 2: You bastards!</p>
<p>SAN pushes them away with HIR and slashes their weapons into two with her switchblade. More guards surround them.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; It's hard to fight against them when we can't kill them.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Yeah, it's easier fighting a demon.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; (thinking) It is wasting our time.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;(thinking) Kagome, please be alright!</p>
<p>MIR and SAN continue to fend off the guards. KAR is looking on from behind a screen in the mansion.</p>
<p class="txt">KAR:&emsp;&nbsp; They're still alive. They are trying not to kill the mansion's guards. Why're they so stupid?</p>
<p>KAR turns around and enters the room where Akago and KAG are.</p>
<p class="txt">Akago:	I wish to kill all of them. Those soldiers will kill them for me. They will kill each other once we corrupt their mindset. (thinking) Human's heart is vulnerable, it's where hatred exist. This girl as well.</p>
<p>KAG's eyes have become glazed, like Kohaku's when he's controlled by Naraku.</p>
<br>
<p>Cut to INU alone, looking at a river and shouting desperately.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Kikyo! Kikyo!! (thinking) I've been following the river described by the monk, but I can't sense Kikyo's scent at all. And no villager have seen any priestess either. What's happening? (speaking) This scent…</p>
<p>INU looks up to find a horde of demons flying past in the sky.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Demons?</p>
<p>Cut to a field near the river. A Jizo statue is lying in the grass. A tail appears behind the statue, and it pops into SHI.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; (thinking) I think they're gone. Luckily, I made it. (looks around) I can't find Inuyasha. And I lose Kirara as well. (takes out an acorn) This is all I have left… I guess I'll have to use it.</p>
<p>INU suddenly appears behind SHI and holds him up. A lot of wailing acorns fall out of SHI's clothes.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; What're you doing, Shippo?</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; Why did you frighten me, you idiot?!</p>
<p>Suddenly a demon appears among the tall grass and SHI panics. It turns out to be huge KIR with a part of a demon in her mouth.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Kirara?</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; So you're alright…</p>
<p>A while later.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; What? Kagome and the others were taken to Naraku's castle? (thinking) While I was searching for Kikyo… Could it be a trap? (speaking) I can sense Kagome and the others this way!</p>
<p>INU starts running. SHI jumps onto KIR, who follows INU.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; We must hurry, Kirara!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (thinking) I'm sorry! Please wait for me!</p>
<br>
<p>Back to MIR and SAN, who are protecting the villagers. The guards are aiming arrows at them.</p>
<p class="txt">Guard 1: Don't be scared of them! Kill them!</p>
<p class="txt">Villager 1: No… No!</p>
<p class="txt">Villager 2: Save us!</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Please forgive me, Sango. I'll have to use Wind Tunnel so that we could get out of here. But…</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;I'd rather stay here if we must kill them! But, priest…</p>
<p>The guards fire and SAN blocks the arrows with HIR.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;We must save Kagome!</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; You're right… we have to fight on!</p>
<p>INU suddenly arrives at the scene.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Miroku! Sango!</p>
<p class="txt">Guard 2: Fire!</p>
<p>The guards fire another round of arrows, which are blocked by INU's TET.</p>
<p class="txt">Guard 3: W-What?</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Inuyasha!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; You bastards! (punches some guards)</p>
<p class="txt">Guard 2: Damn, you demon…!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; You're the leader? (punches Guard 2)</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Run away!</p>
<p>The villagers run away.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (thinking) These men are humans…! (speaking) Could this scent be…</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Inuyasha! Kagome is inside the mansion!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; I got it!</p>
<br>
<p>Cut to INU running into the mansion.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (thinking) It's Kagura's scent!</p>
<br>
<p>Back outside, KIR and SHI have arrived.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Let's go, Priest!</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Yes!</p>
<p>The group starts running.</p>
<br>
<p>Back to INU. He looks around the room and find the dead Lady Okugata and the old monk.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (thinking) This is…the monk who told me Kikyo was still alive… It's a trap indeed! (shouts) Kagome! Damn it, I was late!</p>
<p>INU runs out of the room.</p>
<br>
<p>Cut to KAR in the air on her feather. KAG is seated behind, holding Akago in her arms.</p>
<p class="txtb">[ End of ACT I: 7min 40sec ]</p>
<br>
<p class="txtb"><a name="AII"></a>[ ACT II ]</p>
<p>KAR, KAG and Akago arrive at an abandoned temple. KAN is inside.</p>
<p class="txt">KAR:&emsp;&nbsp; Yo, Kanna.</p>
<p>KAN holds out a dark Sacred Jewel fragment.</p>
<p class="txt">KAR:&emsp;&nbsp; A Sacred Jewel fragment…</p>
<p class="txt">Akago:	Place the polluted fragment into Kagome's body, and she will be completely under our control. My mission is completed! And I shall leave.</p>
<p class="txt">KAR:&emsp;&nbsp; Humph. So with this, Kagome will become one of Naraku's subordinates? (holds up KAG's face) So, she has the same fate of Kohaku.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(thinking) Ko-ha-ku…? This corrupted light, she's going to place that fragment in me? No! I… can't move my body! This baby is clinging onto my soul…! I must let go of him… get away from him!</p>
<p class="txt">Akago:	Wait, Kagura. This girl is stubborn. She has awakened.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(thinking) Please save me, Inuyasha!</p>
<p class="txt">Akago:	It's pointless. You should know that he won't come for you. He chose Kikyo, not you.</p>
<br>
<p>Cut to INU running in a forest.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (thinking) Damn it! I'm such an idiot!</p>
<p><span class="txtb">CUT TO FLASHBACK </span>from previous episode, when the old monk told INU rumors of KIK's whereabouts.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Go, Inuyasha.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (shocked) Kagome?</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Kagome!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Don't hesitate anymore, hurry up! Kikyo is waiting for you!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Y-Yeah… I'm sorry! (runs off)</p>
<p class="txtb">BACK TO PRESENT.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (thinking) I've made the same mistake.</p>
<p><span class="txtb">CUT TO FLASHBACK</span> from previous episode when Akago leaned onto KAG and found the darkness in KAG's heart. Cut to episode 124, when KIK was pushed by Naraku into the poison river. The image of the falling KIK morphs into a falling KAG.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Inuyasha…</p>
<p class="txtb">BACK TO PRESENT.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (thinking) I thought when I lost Kikyo, I was the only one in pain, so I left on my own… Am I going to lose someone precious again? Damn it… (shouts) Wait for me, Kagome! Just wait for me there! Please don't die!</p>
<br>
<p>Back in the temple.</p>
<p class="txt">Akago:	Think of it, Kagome, when you knew Kikyo was dead, you felt happy, didn't you?</p>
<p>KAG gasps.</p>
<p class="txt">Akago:	This woman, who was in your way, was dead… But after knowing that Kikyo was still alive, and Inuyasha left for her. No matter if she's dead or alive, she has Inuyasha's heart. You'll bear a grudge against Inuyasha. You hate Kikyo as well. It's alright to hate them. There's nothing wrong that you hate them… Fill your heart with hatred, and let me hold your soul.</p>
<p>KAG closes her eyes.</p>
<p class="txt">KAR:&emsp;&nbsp; Are you done yet?</p>
<p>KAR moves forward to place the polluted shard in KAG. KAG suddenly throbs.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(thinking) I bear a grudge against Inuyasha. I hate Kikyo. That's true, but…</p>
<p>KAG throbs again. KAR gasps and holds back the shard.</p>
<p class="txt">KAR:&emsp;&nbsp; What's going on? The fragment is not absorbed. (scoffs, thinking) So this child is not that great either…</p>
<p>Akago is taken aback and looks at KAG.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(weakly) Y-You're wrong…</p>
<p class="txt">Akago:	(frowns, thinking) She spoke. What I said had no effect on her.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;What you've said is completely wrong…</p>
<p><span class="txtb">CUT TO FLASHBACK</span> from previous episode when INU was searching for KIK frantically.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(voice-over) Inuyasha will never forget Kikyo. And even if I'm okay with that, it's still painful for me. As what you said, bearing a grudge against Inuyasha, and hating Kikyo, are the feelings that any human would have!</p>
<p>Cut to episode 47, when KAG saw INU and KIK hugging. Cut to episode 48, when KAG returned home and cried in front of the Sacred Tree.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(voice-over) Inuyasha knows that I'm not happy with it… but he tried to avoid it, and this makes me miserable…</p>
<p>Cut to INU and KAG holding hands, after KAG decided to stay with him.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(voice-over) Kikyo didn't exist… I sometimes wished for that…</p>
<p class="txtb">BACK TO PRESENT.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;But… the only thing left… is that… is that… I love Inuyasha!</p>
<p>Akago scowls. INU suddenly crashes into the temple.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Kagome!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Inuyasha…! (thinking) You're finally here…</p>
<p>KAG faints and falls to the ground, releasing Akago. INU rushes forward to hold her.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Kagome! Kagome!</p>
<p class="txt">KAR:&emsp;&nbsp; (catches Akago) This type of girl… is one that Naraku dislikes.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (furious) Damn, what have you done to Kagome?</p>
<p class="txt">Akago:	We just searched her soul… Since you can't forget Kikyo, a void appeared in her heart. Most unfortunate. Her heart was nearly shattered.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; What the heck are you?</p>
<p>KIR arrives at the temple with SHI, SAN and MIR on her back.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Inuyasha!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Guys…!</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; Are you okay, Kagome?</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Kagura! Kanna!</p>
<p class="txt">KAR:&emsp;&nbsp; What? You're still alive?</p>
<p class="txt">Akago:	The priest and the demon exterminator… how many soldiers did you kill?</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; (thinking) This child… he was the one who controlled the soldiers? (speaking) I won't kill without a reason! (gasps, thinking) This child has such pale skin… Could his true form have come from Mount Hakurei? (speaking) You're… Naraku's human heart.</p>
<p class="txt">Akago:	Why do you think that?</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; The reason that Naraku hid in Mount Hakurei was to create a stronger body and also to get rid of his human heart. Naraku wanted to get rid of his heart which longed for Kikyo, in order to kill her.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; This child… possesses a heart that longs for Kikyo? I can't take it! How could he toy with the feelings of humans…?</p>
<p class="txt">Akago:	(laughs) Maybe it's true that I possess Naraku's human heart. I know what people are thinking. I can see their weaknesses. I can make people suffer from sorrows and hatred. It's an easy task! The only thing that I can't sense from Naraku is his painful desire for Kikyo. Where do you think it is? The wall of flesh you spotted at Mount Hakurei. It's there.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; (thinking) That was the disposal of his heart?</p>
<p class="txt">Akago:	That's why I can't feel pain or sorrow.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; In other words, you're a monster born from Naraku's twisted heart? That's enough. I won't let you go! Take this! Wind Scar!!</p>
<p>INU unsheathes TET and throws a Wind Scar at KAR, KAN and Akago. Akago scoffs and a barrier appears around them.</p>
<p class="txt">KAR:&emsp;&nbsp; (thinking) This child is able to put up barriers? So he is not just a cute baby…</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (shocked) Wind Scar is being absorbed!</p>
<p>A vortex appears around the barrier.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Run, everyone!</p>
<p>INU grabs KAG and everyone runs as the Wind Scar is thrown back at them. They manage to dodge it.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Damn it! That child… managed to revert the Wind Scar…!</p>
<p>The barrier has floated upwards, carrying KAN, Akago and KAR.</p>
<p class="txt">Akago:	(laughs) Don't think it's over… I'll be back!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Shut up, you brat! Don't try to touch Kagome again!</p>
<p class="txt">Akago:	Kikyo is dead, Kagome is the only one who can see the Sacred Jewel fragments.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; (thinking) What?</p>
<p class="txt">Akago:	In no time… we'll get Kagome's eyes, and we'll complete the Sacred Jewel. It'll be a Sacred Jewel tainted with hatred.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; You damned idiots! Do you think Kagome would work for Naraku?!</p>
<p class="txt">Akago:	(scoffs) There'll be other chances to get this girl, as long as Kikyo is on your mind, Inuyasha!</p>
<p>INU glares at Akago angrily in silence as they slowly disappear.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Damn it…!</p>
<p>INU looks at the unconscious KAG in his arms.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (thinking) Kagome… I'm sorry that I left you alone. I'll never let Naraku get to you again. I won't… let you suffer like Kikyo.</p>
<br>
<p>Cut to Akago, KAN and KAR on a feather flying in the sky. Akago has his eyes closed.</p>
<p class="txt">KAR:&emsp;&nbsp; What's going on? You don't look well.</p>
<p class="txt">Akago:	Shut up. I want to rest for awhile. (thinking) I didn't expect Kagome's soul to be so resistant… My energy is drained.</p>
<p class="txt">KAR:&emsp;&nbsp; (thinking) What's wrong with him? Did he use up all this strength when dealing with Kagome? Though he is Naraku's child, he is not that powerful.</p>
<p class="txtb">[ End of ACT II: 18min 40sec ]</p>

<p class="txtb"><a name="AIII"></a>[ Epilogue ] *shown after the ending song.</p>
<p>INU is back at KAE's village. They are standing in front of KIK's grave.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; I'm sorry… Kaede…</p>
<p class="txt">KAE:&emsp;&ensp;Don't mention it, Inuyasha. Sister Kikyo was forced to live in this world. In this world, sister's soul suffered more than ever before. And so…</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (looks down, almost crying) I couldn't save Kikyo's soul… And so she was killed by Naraku.</p>
<p class="txt">KAE:&emsp;&ensp;(looks up at the sky) Sister Kikyo's soul is gone… She's no longer suffering.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; But…!</p>
<p class="txt">KAE:&emsp;&ensp;Inuyasha, you'll not suffer anymore, too.</p>
<p>INU doesn't reply.</p>
<p class="txt">KAE:&emsp;&ensp;However, my beloved sister is no longer among us… But it would be better if her bones return to the soil.</p>
<p>INU and KAE look at KIK's grave in silence.</p>
<br>
<p>Cut to MIR, SAN and SHI filling water by a river.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; Is Kagome alright? She's been sleeping since we came back to the village.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Don't worry, Inuyasha is there.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;It'll be alright.</p>
<br>
<p>Cut to KAE's hut. INU is looking at an unconscious KAG. KAG wakes.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (glad) You're awake now, Kagome?</p>
<p>KAG looks at INU blankly for a moment and smiles weakly.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;I see. You came in the end, Inuyasha. (sits up)</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (holds KAG) Are you alright? Don't force yourself.</p>
<br>
<p>Cut to KAG and INU in the forest, talking.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Kagome… I am sorry for what I've done. I shouldn't have left you alone…</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;It's okay, don't worry.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; It's not okay! I nearly got you into trouble! (thinking) Any later… I would've lost you, Kagome…</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Well, if you hear anything about Kikyo's whereabouts, you'll go look for her again, wouldn't you?</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; I won't! I'll never leave you again!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Liar.</p>

<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;I know you'd go! I've known you for so long! (fiercer) There's no doubt you'd go!</p>

<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;And I'll feel annoyed… You should understand it, right?</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (surprised) Kagome…</p>
<p>KAG sighs and leans on INU.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; You're mad, aren't you?</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Sure, but…</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Ya?</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(sighs, thinking) Inuyasha, I won't force you to forget Kikyo. There's nothing I can do… because I love you…</p>
