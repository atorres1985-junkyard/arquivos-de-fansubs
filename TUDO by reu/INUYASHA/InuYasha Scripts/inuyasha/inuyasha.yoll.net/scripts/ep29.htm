Sango has a brother named Kohaku who died in one of Naraku's traps. The scar on her back constantly reminds her of him. How sad… The murderer who appears in front of Inuyasha shocked Sango. Is this ruthless young kid Sango's…?! But?! Next episode, 'Sango's Worries and Kohaku's Life'!</p>

<p>Flashback of previous episode: Demon swarm charging towards INU, who slays them with the Wind Scar.</p>
<p>Cut to Naraku’s castle surrounded by ominous purple mist. A bee flies and makes a few circles, transmitting a message. Cut to interior of a room, where Naraku is sitting in the shadows. The bee flies off.</p>
<p class="txt">NAR:&emsp;&ensp;I see. Inuyasha killed them with one swing of Tetsusaiga? (chuckles evilly and stands) Rather than sending 100 demons, send one he cannot kill. Well, kill or miss. (looks at a further spot) I intend to use you. Are you agreeable?</p>
<p>Cut to back view of NAR. He is facing a silhouette outside the room. The screens turn a blood red.</p>

<p>INU yells and tries to perform the Wind Scar. Nothing happens.</p>

<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; (sitting on a tree branch behind INU) Don’t be disheartened. Even if it was sheer luck, you saved us all. (Lying back with his hands behind his neck) Next time, just get lucky again.</p>

<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; (madder) Are you listening to me? Don’t get lucky now!</p>

<p>Cut to MIR and INU sitting by a campfire.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Naraku took the offensive. If he’s keeping a watch on us from somewhere, it’ll be hard to make a move.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (chuckles heh-heh-heh confidently) It’ll save us time looking for him. That bastard, let him come and attack anytime, anywhere!</p>
<p>MIR smiles and lets out a chuckle.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Miroku, what’re you laughing about?!</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; (smiling) Sorry. (looks at his right hand) I won’t be able to use my Wind Tunnel for a while. (clenches it and looks at INU) Hearing you talk with such confidence is gratifying.</p>

<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(piqued) No way! He’s so standoffish!</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;(inquisitive) Do you want him to look?</p>
<p>Cut to SAN stepping into the hot spring with a towel. KAG is already inside. Cut to back view of SAN. A wind blows her hair to reveal a scar on her back.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(shocked) Those scars…</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Yeah… they didn’t heal completely.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Were they from the demons?</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;(sits into the hot spring) No… (sad) I got these scars from my dead younger brother. If only I had realized it sooner, I could have prevented it all.</p>
<p>Flashback to episode 24 (Enter Sango, The Demon Slayer). SAN and KOH badly injured and unconscious. They have been shot by arrows.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;(voice-over) Kohaku was a weak, gentle boy. Perhaps, he wasn’t suited to be a slayer.</p>
<p>Back to hot spring.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(looks down) I’m sorry to make you remember such bad memories.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;(smiles) It’s all right. Before he died, Kohaku had reverted to his old self. I’m sad, but that has somewhat eased the pain. I’m a Demon Slayer. It can’t be helped. Everyone else has a reason for being here, right? (turns to KAG) Kagome, why are you gathering Sacred Jewel fragments?</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Huh? Err… well, I feel bad about my involvement…</p>
<p>Some time later.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;(surprised) You broke the Jewel?!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;I’m sorry. I really did something horrible.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;But you were trying to take it back from a demon, so it can’t be helped. But you’re the reincarnation of a priestess? Amazing!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;I don’t even understand that part. (holding up her Jewel necklace) I can see the fragments of the Sacred Jewel. So we’ve joined forces to collect the fragments. (looks up) With Naraku’s appearance, things have gotten more complicated.</p>
<p>Cut to back view of KAG and SAN, partially blocked by bushes.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;In order to break the curse of the Sacred Jewel, we must first destroy Naraku.</p>
<p>KAG agrees. Close-up of SAN picking up a rock.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Do you understand that… (turns around and speaks sternly) you over there?! (throws the rock into the bushes)</p>
<p>The rock hits a monkey. It falls to the ground with swirly eyes and a huge bump on its head.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Huh?!</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;A monkey?</p>
<p>MIR and INU appears.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Hey! What’s the ruckus?!</p>
<p>Several loud thumps are heard.</p>
<p>Cut to MIR with a huge bump on his head and scratches around his eye, but he has a face on bliss. Pans sideways to see INU bashed up the same way. He, however, folded his arms with a face of indignation.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; (sitting by the campfire with KIR in his lap) For once, you were really talking seriously.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (pissed) Why’d they have to suspect me, too?!</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; (contented) So what? That was a wonderful sight we just saw.</p>
<p>Cut to KAG and SAN by the hot spring drying themselves.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(thinking) Everyone has been drawn into the curse of the Sacred Jewel, but I feel most sorry for Sango, who watched as her father and younger brother were killed.</p><br>
<p>It’s day time and INU-gang is setting off.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; (in front of KAG’s huge haversack) Now then, time to go. (tries to lift it but only manages to drag it several steps) Kagome, what did you bring?! It’s much heavier than before!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(walking along with her bicycle) Uh-huh… I have a test next week, so I brought as many books as I could carry.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;You have it rough, huh?</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Miroku says you should just “flunk” or something like that.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Not Miroku, too?! (turning to SAN) My brother, Sota, who’s only in grade school, says “If you repeat grades six times, I’ll be in the same grade as you and I’ll help you study.” (SAN smiles and turns away) What a cocky young brother, don’t you think? (realizing she shouldn’t have mentioned her brother) Oh… (looks at SAN)</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;(walking ahead) He acts tough and he’s cocky. (pauses) Yet he cries easily and gets lonely. (turns to face KAG) Isn’t he a good boy, this brother of yours? (smiles)</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(surprised, then smiles back) Uh-huh.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; (pushing the haversack in an upright position) Hey, someone’s coming.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Huh?</p>
<p>The three of them looks ahead. A bleeding man trudges slowly towards them and collapses midway.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Inuyasha! Hurry!</p>
<p>Cut to INU-gang surrounding collapsed man.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; (getting up from his kneeling position) He’s not breathing. Seems like an ordinary villager.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;(thinking) These scars…aren’t from a sword.</p>
<p>KAG offers a prayer.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; He’s not the only one who was killed.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Huh?</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (glancing sideways) The wind is carrying the smell of blood. Not just a few… Many have been killed.</p><br>
<p>Fades to a devastated village. INU-gang rushes towards several corpses on the ground.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; The entire village?</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; Hey! Anyone here?!</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; We must find out what happened. Let’s split up and search.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Good idea.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Hold it! (bends down to pick up a rock)</p>
<p>SAN looks around and throw it at a nearby hut. The hut immediately explodes.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Don’t move! Traps are everywhere! If you make a move, the legs may be blown off!</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; What?! Even underground?!</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Then even around the bodies?</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Probably.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;What a cruel thing to do?!</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Someone tries to help, and they’re also blown up. So heartless!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (pissed) Well, let’s find out what this guy is planning!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Inuyasha! It’s dangerous to move!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; As if I know how to stay still!</p>
<p>INU sprints and leaps into the air. His transformed TET slices a hut, which explodes. The silhouetted person at Naraku’s castle previously leaps out of the hut. He takes out a sickle and swings it at INU, who blocks it. The sickle returns to the mysterious person.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Is he the one?!</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; (in disbelief) A mere child…killed all the villagers?!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Impossible!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; That chain…and on his body…there’s blood splattered all over! He’s a vicious kid! Why’d you do this?! What’re you up to?!</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;(trembling in horror and disbelief, thinking) Kohaku!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(thinking) That attire… (looks back at SAN) is the same as Sango’s…a slayer’s.</p>
<p>KIR meows and walks forward a few steps.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;(looking at KIR, thinking) Kirara is… But how…?! (looks forward, speaking softly) Kohaku… are you?!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(thinking) Sango…what did you just say?!</p>
<p>KOH turns around and runs away.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (following) Halt!</p>
<p>INU steps on a mine during his chase and it explodes. He is uninjured, but is thrown backwards.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Damn! (blocks a remnants of the explosion with TET)</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Kirara!</p>
<p>KIR leaps onto SAN’s palm. SAN flings her into the sky and KIR transform into her flying form. SAN leaps and grabs on to KIR’s neck fur.</p><br>
<p>Cut to KOH sprinting through the woods. His back turns briefly to the camera and a Sacred Jewel is seen embedded. He runs into a barrier, into which KIR and SAN also follow.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (halts his chase abruptly) W-what?! A barrier!</p>
<p>Cut to SAN giving chase on KIR’s back, in the barrier.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;(thinking) Kohaku…I thought you were dead!</p><br>
<p>Cut to INU leaping among tree branches, with MIR, SHI and KAG on his back. He stops just before the barrier.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Damn! We’re here! Hurry and get off!</p>
<p>MIR and KAG gets off.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; The two of them went through this barrier?</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Yeah…Kagome, what you said earlier…is that really true?</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;No mistake about it. Sango called him Kohaku. Sango told me that her younger brother was killed in that castle occupied by Naraku.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; And he had a Sacred Jewel fragment imbedded in his back. We’ve heard that one before.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; It’s Naraku’s same old trick, forcing Sango to fight when she was in total anguish.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; Then Naraku is manipulating Kohaku this time?</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Sango is probably aware of it. The barrier allowed only Sango to go through. I have bad feelings about this.</p><br>
<p>Back to SAN and KIR. They land and SAN gets off to face KOH. KIR is hostile towards him.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;(comforting KIR) Let me see your face.</p>
<p>KOH takes off his mask. He looks at SAN, expressionless.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;(gasps) Kohaku… (walks towards him, thinking) You are alive! Kohaku!</p>
<p class="txt">Voice:&ensp; Are you happy to see your brother alive?</p>
<p>SAN is taken aback by the voice. A silhouette of appears behind KOH. It turns out to be NAR in baboon suit.</p>
<p class="txt">NAR:&emsp;&ensp;It’s been quite some time, Sango.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Naraku!</p>
<p class="txt">NAR:&emsp;&ensp;(laughs) Aren’t you going to thank me?</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;What?!</p>
<p class="txt">NAR:&emsp;&ensp;I salvaged your brother’s life. When he was killed by those arrows at the castle, Kohaku’s life should have ended. But I saved him. You should know this well, the power of a Sacred Jewel fragment. When you had it inside you, you fought Inuyasha better than evenly matched.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Shut up!</p>
<p class="txt">NAR:&emsp;&ensp;(unfazed) So it is now Kohaku. He is able to stand before you because of the Sacred Jewel. If it is extracted, he will die. Understand, Sango? Kohaku’s life is in your hands.</p>
<p>SAN gasps.</p>
<p class="txt">NAR:&emsp;&ensp;Bring me the Tetsusaiga, Inuyasha’s sword. Then I shall let Kohaku have eternal life. (laughs)</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;(furious) Don’t underestimate me!</p>
<p>SAN gets ready to swing her HIR, but is stopped by KOH’s sickle.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Kohaku, why?! Why protect Naraku?!</p>
<p class="txt">NAR:&emsp;&ensp;I’ve made him forget. I’ve erased all memories of you and of himself. A fighting machine has no need of feelings. He slaughtered an entire village. Kohaku has become a fine slayer.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;(furious) Why you…! (dashes towards NAR and KOH)</p>
<p>NAR emits a purple mist, stopping SAN.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;(covering her face) Miasma!</p>
<p class="txt">NAR:&emsp;&ensp;You will bring me the Tetsusaiga. (the miasma grows stronger and explodes) I will be waiting…Sango.</p>
<p>NAR and KOH disappears with the miasma. SAN looks up to the sky in silence.</p><br>
<p>A silhouette of SAN and KIR appears from the woods, walking towards the INU-gang.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Sango! (walks to SAN) That boy…your brother…</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;(furious and interrupts) He wasn’t Kohaku!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Sango…</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Well, the main thing is that you returned unharmed. Sango… The one who laid this trap, the one behind the barrier, was it Naraku?</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Uh-huh.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Then you must be exhausted. Let us return to the village and get some rest. (walks off)</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Monk… (MIR pauses) Please, hold a service for the villagers.</p>
<p>MIR nods.</p>

<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; This is the last. Amazing Kirara…her experience in a village of slayers paid off. (relieved) She sniffed out all the traps.

<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;She said she met Naraku. I wondered what happened to Sango behind the barrier.</p>

If Sango can’t kill him, I’ll do it in one swing! (looking into distance and shouting) Hey Sango! Any complaints?!</p>

<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Of course! Think about it! Naraku sent Sango’s brother believing that we wouldn’t be able to kill him. No way will I fall for that!</p>
