<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; It's now time for Inuyasha!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;To find the Sacred Jewel fragments,</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; I have to defeat Naraku with this Tetsusaiga!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;We’re on a long journey seeking clues to find Naraku. We overcame the depressing moments together, but… Now, the horrible darkness hinders us.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Miroku and Sango and Shippo and Kirara!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;An excitng adventure unfolds!</p>
<p class="txt">INU &amp; KAG: Inuyasha!</p><br>
<p class="txtb"><a name="AI"></a>[ ACT I ]</p>
<p>Evening. INU-gang is in a misty ravaged forest. INU is sniffing the ground.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; (squats in front of INU, worried) How is it, Inuyasha? Still can't find the exit?</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Shut up! You get on my nerves! (turns around and continues sniffing)</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; (runs and squats in front of INU) You've been like this since morning. Night will come soon. (trembles)</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Why are you shivering?</p>
<p>SHI freezes in action, sweat drop.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Priest, this forest seems like…</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Yes, indeed… It has to be a demon territory.</p>
<p>A loud noise is heard suddenly. SAN and MIR wince. SHI climbs onto INU's head, trembling in fear. INU looks at him in a deadpan manner. KAG examines her bicycle tire.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(sad) I did it again…</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Won't you just throw that piece of junk away?!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;No way! My mother bought this for me. (gasps and turns around) It's coming. Some dark force.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Finally. It's time for the master of this forest to appear…</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Could it be a demon or an evil spirit?</p>
<p>A huge flock of moths fly towards them and engulf the area.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (scoffs) The sooner it shows itself, the sooner we'll get this over with! (throws SHI aside and draws TET) Stop being so arrogant and just show yourself!!</p>
<p>A loud explosion is heard. A demon with red marks across his face and carrying a huge hatchet appears.</p>
<p class="txt">Demon: (laughs) Welcome to my &quot;Forest of Despair&quot;.</p>
<p class="ttable">* From the credits, this moth demon's name is Garamaru. Garamaru abbreviated as GAR from now onwards. *</p><br>
<p class="txtb">[ Title screen: Nightmarish Reality: Battle in the Forest of Despair ]</p><br>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; He is…!</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; (climbs onto KAG's shoulder) Kagome, that demon is…!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Yes… Gatenmaru.</p>
<p class="txt">GAR:&emsp;&ensp;Oh… So you know Gatenmaru? He's the shame of our clan.</p>
<p><span class="txtb">CUT TO FLASHBACK </span>from episode 51 when Gatenmaru appeared with his group of bandits in a village.</p>
<p class="txt">GAR:&emsp;&ensp;(voice-over) He worked together with the humans.</p>
<p class="txt">Cut to Gatenmaru fighting with INU.</p>
<p class="txt">GAR:&emsp;&ensp;(voice-over) And I heard he was defeated by a half-demon.</p>
<p class="txt">Gatenmaru: (looks at TET) What a great sword for cutting!</p>
<p class="txtb">END OF FLASHBACK.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (scoffs and swings TET) This half-demon here… see no challenge in killing you demons.</p>
<p><span class="txtb">CUT TO FLASHBACK </span>from episode 52 when INU turned full-demon and fought Gatenmaru in his moth demon form.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (voice-over) I defeated him in a pretty uninteresting way.</p>
<p class="txt">Gatenmaru: Can't be… Is this be his demon's blood?</p>
<p>Gatenmaru raise himself up and spews poison foam, which surrounds INU. The foam dissipates and INU is gone. Gatenmaru looks up to find INU leaping above him.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; You pesky moth!</p>
<p>INU claws GAT from the mouth downwards, breaking his body into many pieces.</p>
<p class="txtb">END OF FLASHBACK.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (points TET) I'll gladly accept if you want to take revenge for Gatenmaru!</p>
<p class="txt">GAR:&emsp;&ensp;Revenge, you say? What a joke! That fool deserved to die. It's none of my concern.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Whatever! I just don't like you moth demons! Why not you go to hell?! (jumps)</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Inuyasha!</p>
<p>GAR hisses and spews light blades at INU. INU leaps and dodges. He swings TET at GAR who leaps backwards. A pair of colorful burst out from behind him. INU sprints forth to attack him, but GAR merely flies upwards. Suddenly KAG's cry is heard in the background.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (turns around, worried) What?!</p>
<p>A light orb appears on the chest of SHI, SAN, MIR and KAG. Everyone tries to push the orbs away from them.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;What's that…?</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;We let our guards down!</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; (struggling) It's struck! It's going further in!!</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Our strength…</p>
<p class="txt">The orb enters MIR's body. He winces in pain and falls to his knees.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; (weakly) …is being absorbed…</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (runs to the group) Damn!</p>
<p>GAR flies lower and spins a cocoon each around everyone.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (horrified) Kagome! Kagome!</p>
<p>INU tries desperately to slash the cocoon web apart but to no avail.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (stops) Tetsusaiga is not working!</p>
<p class="txt">GAR:&emsp;&ensp;(laughs) Eating human flesh is looked down upon in our clan. What we feast upon is your despair and fears!</p>
<p>INU tries to claw MIR's cocoon apart. A faint image of MIR unconscious is seen through the web.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Damn it! Miroku! You're being weak! Hey, Miroku!</p>
<p>The claw marks that INU made on the cocoon heals and MIR can't be seen again. INU runs to SAN's cocoon and puts his hands on it. The poison cocoon burns his palms but INU doesn't care. SAN remains unconscious.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Sango! Hang in there!</p>
<p class="txt">GAR:&emsp;&ensp;(background) There's no use shouting, they can't hear a word you say.</p>
<p>INU runs desperately to SHI's cocoon. Cute KIR is also in the cocoon. Both of them are unconscious and don't hear INU's cries.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Shippo! Answer me! Shippo! Shippo!!</p>
<p class="txt">GAR:&emsp;&ensp;(background) They won't live to see sunrise… Their bodies and souls will soon be devoured by me!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (takes TET) Wind Scar… I should test it.</p>
<p>INU tries to visualize using the Wind Scar to destroy the cocoons. He thinks that the cocoon would break but he would end up killing them too.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (sheathes TET) It's of no use. The only way to dispel this is to defeat him.</p>
<p class="txt">GAR:&emsp;&ensp;(background) Now… In the nightmare they created, let the fear and dreadful memories of your past spew forth!</p>
<p>Cut to KAG, MIR and SHI entwined in each of their cocoons. Cut to SAN entangled in her cocoon.</p><br>
<p><span class="txtb">FADE TO SAN'S PAST.</span> KOH is chasing cute KIR happily in the village of the demon slayers. KOH tries to catch her but she's too fast for him.</p>
<p class="txt">KOH:&emsp;&nbsp;Hey! (chiding) Kirara!</p>
<p>KIR runs around KOH's feet, causing him to fumble. She then leaps on the head and jumps off, making him fall. KIR lands and mews. SAN and their father look on.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;(giggles) Are you okay, Kohaku?</p>
<p class="txt">Father: (to SAN) If he's struggling with Kirara, he may not be ready for the real battle yet.</p>
<p>KIR continues to chase KIR.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Don't think so far, father. Kohaku has already mastered the Chain Scythe.</p>
<p class="txt">Father: If you say so.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;It's okay. I'll be with him when it comes to that. (looks at KOH)</p>
<p>Cut to flashback from episode 24 when KOH was possessed and killed his father and the slayers. SAN looks at KOH, horrified. Cut to the guards in NAR's castle firing arrows at KOH.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Kohaku!!</p>
<p>Cut to SAN crawling to the fallen KOH weakly.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Kohaku…</p>
<p class="txt">KOH:&emsp;&nbsp;(crying, weakly) Sister… I'm afraid…</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;It's okay… I'm here…</p>
<p>Arrows suddenly pierce through SAN's back. She winces and falls over.</p>
<p><span class="txtb">CUT TO PRESENT. </span>SAN's hand turns into a moth-like one for a split second and reverts. SAN is still unconscious.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;(mumbling) Kohaku…</p><br>
<p>Cut to MIR in his cocoon.</p>
<p><span class="txtb">FADE TO MIR's PAST. </span>Monk Mushin and a young MIR are in a brothel. Mushin is drinking sake and enjoying a performance put up by the geishas. Young MIR is frowning.</p>
<p class="txt">Mushin: Nice, nice. How's this, Miroku? This allows you to forget about all the bad and dreadful times, right?</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Master Mushin, why isn't my father here?</p>
<p>Mushin grunts and takes a sip of sake.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Master Mushin?</p>
<p class="txt">Mushin: Your father told me… not to let you see him depart this life…</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Departure from life?</p>
<p class="txt">Mushin: He's probably already…</p>
<p>Young MIR gasps. Cut to MIR's father being sucked into his own Wind Tunnel. Mushin holds to young MIR as he tries to runs to his father.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Father!!!</p>
<p>Mushin looks away sadly.</p>
<p><span class="txtb">CUT TO PRESENT. </span>A pair of moth feelers appear momentarily over MIR's head and fades away. MIR is still unconscious.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; (mumbling) Father…</p><br>
<p>Cut to SHI in his cocoon.</p>
<p><span class="txtb">FADE TO SHI's PAST.</span> SHI is running in a field excitedly. He runs in some tall grass carrying an armful of acorns.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; Dad! Dad, look at this! I've found a lot of acorns!</p>
<p>SHI gasps and drops the acorns. Hiten and Manten appear, laughing smugly. Manten has worn SHI's dead dad around his waist as a pelt. SHI falls to the ground in disbelief. He then cries and wails.</p>
<p><span class="txtb">CUT TO PRESENT. </span>A moth abdomen appears momentarily over SHI's lower body and disappears. SHI is still unconscious.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; (mumbling) Dad…</p><br>
<p>Cut to KAG in her cocoon.</p>
<p><span class="txtb">FADE TO KAG's NIGHTMARE.</span> KAG and Sota are standing in front of the Dry Well hut in the Higurashi Shrine.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;What's wrong, Sota?</p>
<p class="txt">Sota:&emsp;Buyo is inside. This place is creepy and scary.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;What's wrong?</p>
<p>KAG walks towards the well.</p>
<p class="txt">Sota:&emsp;(scared) Sister…</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(gasps) Is it an evil aura?</p>
<p>A pink light glows in the well.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;No way! It can't be!</p>
<p>Amidst the pink light and fumes, NAR in his baboon suit appears and laughs.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(grabs Sota) Sota, we need to run! NOW! Sota, come on!</p>
<p>KAG runs in the courtyard with Sota. A miasma starts to emit from the Dry Well hut. MOM and GRA run towards them.</p>
<p class="txt">Mama: What's wrong, Kagome?</p>
<p class="txt">GRA:&emsp; What's the commotion?!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Don't come over!</p>
<p>A loud explosion is heard and NAR zooms towards KAG and Sota. They hug each other and shriek in terror.</p>
<p><span class="txtb">CUT TO PRESENT. </span>A pair of moth eyes appear momentarily over KAG's eyes and disappears. KAG is still unconscious. She gasps.</p><br>
<p>Cut to GAR standing on a withered tree.</p>
<p class="txt">GAR:&emsp;&ensp;Suffering… Once the suffering is over, endless despair awaits. All of you should slowly experience the whole process…</p>
<p>INU jumps up to attack GAR. GAR dodges.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; You bastard, what did you do to them?!</p>
<p class="txt">GAR:&emsp;&ensp;(scoffs) I'm just letting them dream…</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Dream?</p>
<p class="txt">GAR:&emsp;&ensp;Be it humans or demons, the fear you have inside you will come to life in your dreams. That's what we feed on.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (furious) You despicable bastard!!</p>
<p>INU jumps and swings TET at GAR. GAR blocks with his hatchet. INU lands.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Let Kagome and the others out now!</p>
<p class="txt">GAR:&emsp;&ensp;Oh, half-demon… I can see your fear…</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; What?!</p>
<p class="txt">GAR:&emsp;&ensp;You must feel very lonely right now. That's why you're yelling away.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Stop your crap!!</p>
<p>INU sprints forth angrily and attacks GAR. GAR blocks with his hatchet. Static surges as the two weapons collide.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; I can fight on my own!! But I will never let my friends become your food!</p>
<p class="txt">GAR:&emsp;&ensp;(scoffs) Trying to be brave.</p>
<p>GAR backs off and his face morphs into that of a moth. His armor then burst to reveal a moth body.</p>
<p class="txt">GAR:&emsp;&ensp;(shouts) I will have your fear of loneliness as my appetizer!!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Shut up and take this! Wind Scar!!</p>
<p>INU throws a Wind Scar at GAR which disintegrates him into pieces.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (walks to GAR's fallen head and scoffs) Not much of a challenge… (sheathes TET)</p>
<p class="txt">GAR:&emsp;&ensp;(laughs) You think you've won?</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; What?</p>
<p>Cut to SAN's hand morphing into a moth's, MIR growing moth feelers out from his head and SHI's body morphing into a moth's.</p>
<p class="txt">GAR:&emsp;&ensp;(voice-over) Even if I die, those cocoons will still eat their souls, and use their bodies to be reborn again.</p>
<p>Cut to KAG morphing into a moth.</p>
<p class="txt">GAR:&emsp;&ensp;(voice-over) Prepare to meet your doom when that happens…</p>
<p>Fade to present. INU twitches in fear and anger.</p>

<p>GAR laughs smugly as his head disintegrates into ash. INU turns to look at his friends in the cocoons.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (horrified) The cocoons won't disappear?! What should I do? What should I…</p>

<p>INU slashes the cocoons desperately with TET, but hardly makes a scratch. Every time he makes a cut, the cut heals.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Damn it!</p>
<p>INU then leaps and claws a cocoon angrily.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; You…Bastard!!</p>
<p>The cocoon heals again. Smoke smolders from his claws.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Kagome… Shippo…! Miroku…! Sango!!</p><br>

<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Huh?</p>
<p class="txt">KOH:&emsp;&nbsp;I killed a demon myself!</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Killed a demon?</p>
<p>Dead corpses of KAG, huge KIR and SHI lay in a pile behind KOH. KOH smiles proudly. Blood trickles from his sickle-chain.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;(disbelief) You…!</p>
<p class="txt">KOH:&emsp;&nbsp;(looks at the corpses) Father will praise me for this, right?</p>
<p>SAN whimpers and cries. KOH turns to SAN and gasps. Cut to SAN killing KOH with HIR.</p>
<p class="txt">KOH:&emsp;&nbsp;(weakly) Sister…</p>
<p>KOH falls to the ground. SAN turns to look at him in despair. There is a short pauses and she runs to KOH.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Kohaku!!</p>
<p>SAN holds up KOH and hugs him tightly. KOH's eyes suddenly open, glazed. SAN winces in pain as KOH strikes her in the back with his sickle-chain.</p>
<p class="txt">KOH:&emsp;&nbsp;(expressionless) It's your fault, sister… You just wouldn't praise me.</p>
<p>SAN falls over.</p><br>

<p>Young MIR continues running away from Mushin. He morphs into the present MIR and continues running.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Naraku. I'll find Naraku!</p>
<p>MIR stops in a wide open field. NAR in his baboon suit stands a distance away. He turns to look at MIR. A gust of wind blows from MIR's Wind Tunnel hand even though he hasn't open it.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; (gasps and clenches his fist) So close to my goal…</p>
<p>SHI, MIR and SAN appear in front of MIR. MIR is taken aback and puts his Wind Tunnel hand behind him.</p>

<p>MIR winces and struggles as the wind from his hand gets stronger. SAN, SHI and KAG shriek as they are sucked into the Wind Tunnel.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; (disbelief) This can't be…! I didn't even open it.</p>
<p class="txt">NAR:&emsp;&ensp;(laughs) Priest, did you want to be saved that much? Even if it means that you'd have to sacrifice your friends?</p>

<p>The wind gets stronger and MIR yells.</p><br>

Hiten and Manten suddenly appear behind him and blocks his way. They laugh menacingly. SHI gasps and turns around. The army of lizard demons have closed in on him. They stick out their long tongues menacingly. SHI runs to the side, yelling in terror.</p>

<p>KAG is taken aback.</p>
<p class="txt">Yuka:&emsp;I think you've been studying too much.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(grimaces) Not really.</p>
<p>A cloud of miasma suddenly appears outside the classroom window.</p>

<p>The miasma starts to engulf the school. Her classmates are surprised.</p>

<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Kagome! Is that your true strength?! (furious) Are you guys so weak that you'd be devoured by a dream?!</p>
<p>INU claws the cocoon desperately. Smoke smolders from his hand.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (panting) I'll lose faith in you if you're giving up so easily. I'll defeat Naraku myself! Don't be crying later!</p>
<p>INU sprints forth and digs his claws through the scratches made on the coccon.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Wake up!! Don't let a moth demon eat your soul!</p>
<p>Static surges. INU winces in pain and struggles to hold on. He is then thrown off by the charge. INU gets up weakly and staggers. Blood drips down his hand.</p>
