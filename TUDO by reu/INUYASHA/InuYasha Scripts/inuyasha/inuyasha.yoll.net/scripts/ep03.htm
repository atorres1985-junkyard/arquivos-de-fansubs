<p>In a forest, by a waterfall.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;You've gotta be kidding! Even if it is Feudal Japan… There's no hot baths?! (standing naked in a river, shivering) C-C-Cuh-Cuh… (squats into the river) Cold!</p>
<p class="txt">KAE:&emsp;&ensp;(sitting on the riverbank by a fire) Kagome, don't force it. Come on out.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;No! I'm all bloody and dirty. And I can't stand my filthy hair!</p>
<p>KAG gathers herself for a moment and plunges into  the water. KAE gives up and sighs. Pan upwards, a cliff overlooking the riverbank. INU is resting on one of the tree branches, eyeing KAG and KAE sideways spitefully. Cut to KAG swimming in the river.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(thinking) The Sacred Jewel…</p>
<p><span class="txtb">CUT TO FLASHBACK</span> of  modern day Japan, of KAG's day before she fell into the well.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(narrating) My name is Higurashi Kagome.  I'm just your average school kid but, through some strange, weird situation, I've ended up here, in the &quot;Warring States&quot; era.</p>
<p>Cut to KAG's encounter with the Centipede Monster in the Dry Well.</p>
<p class="txt">Centipede: Rejoice! My power is coming back! My body is being restored! You have it… I know you have it!! (her lower body, which was just bones, fill out and turns into a long centipede body) You have it, don't you? Don't you? (licks KAG's face with her long pointed tongue)</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Let me go! You're disgusting! Let me go! (struggles and shoves her left hand into the centipede's face) Let me go, I said! (light emits from KAG's palm which throws centipede back, releasing KAG)</p>
<p>Cut to KAG's second encounter with the Centipede-Monster and the Corpse Crow.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(narrating) I've also become the target of demons, all after a jewel in my body. This &quot;Jewel of Four Souls&quot; which belonged to some &quot;Kikyo&quot; person… How did it end up in ME? Now I have to team up with a half-demon called &quot;Inuyasha&quot; who wants Jewel's power and who intends to keep the fragments for himself. Am I dreaming? But it's NOT a dream!</p><br>
<p class="txtb">[ Title screen: Down the Rabbit Hole and Back Again ]</p><br>
<p>Nighttime. KAG holds up a fragment of the Sacred Jewel and looks at it intently. KAG, INU and KAE are sitting in KAE's hut, by the fire.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; What's going on?!</p>
<p class="txt">KAE:&emsp;&ensp;Stop barking, Inuyasha.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; What happened to the Jewel?!</p>
<p class="txt">KAE:&emsp;&ensp;The arrow to which Kagome attached the crow's feet hit the Corpse Crow and destroyed it, but it also shattered the Sacred Jewel. In other words, fragments of the Sacred Jewel have been scattered throughout the world. Who knows whether there were one hundred fragments or a thousand. Should even one fragment fall into evil hands, however, the destruction will be incalculable.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;It wasn't my fault… was it? (thinking) I feel sort of responsible…</p>
<p class="txt">KAE:&emsp;&ensp;Kagome, Inuyasha… You must use your combined strength to gather the fragments and restore the Sacred Jewel!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(shocked) Heh?</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Listen up, old hag! I'm one of the &quot;evil-doers&quot; looking for the Jewel!</p>
<p class="txt">KAE:&emsp;&ensp;It cannot be helped…</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(thinking) But… I have to go home!</p>
<p><span class="txtb">Cut to present.</span> KAG swimming and bathing in the river.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(thinking) Besides, I don't have such powers…! And Inuyasha is so selfish!</p>
<p>KAG stands up in the water, and walks towards KAE. She looks upwards, noticing INU's presence. INU is sitting on the ledge of the cliff, staring at KAG innocently, blinking his eyes. Horrified, KAG screams and sits back into the water.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Sit!!</p>
<p>The rosary on INU's neck pulls at him, making him fall flat-faced onto the ground.</p>
<p class="txt">KAE:&emsp;&ensp;So you are here, Inuyasha.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Damn! I'd forgotten about the subjudawhatchamacallit.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(puts her clothes on behind a bush) Shame on you! Spying like that!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Huh?! Keh! Idiot! All I was doing was--</p>
<p class="txt">KAE:&emsp;&ensp;(holding the jewel up and turns to INU) …trying to steal the Sacred Jewel. Yes, I know.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (sits up) If you knew, why'd you ask?</p>
<p class="txt">KAE:&emsp;&ensp;The future looks very bleak… Inuyasha, unless you join forces with Kagome, who has the ability to &quot;see&quot; the Jewel, there is no way all of the fragments will be found.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; And I'm tellin' you that if it's for the sake of the Sacred Jewel, I'll put up with the dumb girl, so stop worryin'!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Do you really dislike me that much, huh?</p>
<p>KAG walks up to INU wearing KAE's priestess clothes, with her hair tied up, looking exactly like KIK, as KAE and KIK's priestess robes are the same. Images of KIK flashes across INU's mind. </p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (thinking) Kikyo…</p>
<p>Cut to a while later, KAG is folding her school uniform. INU sits with his hands on the ground (like a dog), stares at KAG and growls.</p>
<p class="txt">KAE:&emsp;&ensp;What's that expression on your face, Inuyasha?</p>
<p>INU shoves himself sideways from them. KAG glares back.</p>
<p class="txtb">[ End of ACT 1: 5min 17sec ]</p><br>
<p class="txtb"><a name="_ACT_II_"></a>[ ACT II ]</p>
<p>In a dark cave filled with skulls. A woman's silhouette is seen against a red background.</p>
<p class="txt">Sexy woman: Well, well… The Sacred Jewel I thought lost over fifty years ago has appeared once more. It's going to be very interesting…</p>
<p>She picks up a skull with some hair left, and combs it affectionately. She, then giggles hysterically.</p>
<br>
<p>Back at the riverbank with KAE, INU and KAG. A woman with a baby on her bag appears and walks towards the group.</p>
<p class="txt">Woman: Priestess Kaede…</p>
<p class="txt">KAE:&emsp;&ensp;Yes?</p>
<p class="txt">Woman: My daughter…</p>
<p>A while later.</p>
<p class="txt">KAE:&emsp;&ensp;I see. I will be right there. (to INU and KAG) I must return. Do not fight.</p>
<p>The woman bows to them and walks back to the village with KAE. There is a long silence between KAG and INU. </p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Hey.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;What.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Get undressed.</p>
<p>Cut to the sky, a loud crash is heard. Cut to KAG and INU, who is wincing in pain with a huge bump on his head.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Oww! Why you… Why did you--?!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(holding a rock) Pervert!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (furious, pointing to KAG's uniform drying on the riverbank) I didn't mean <i>undress</i> undress! I meant put your own weird stuff back on!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Because this makes me look like Kikyo?</p>
<p>INU is stumped by KAG's question and looks away indignantly.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (childish) Whatever.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(thinking) Oh, please…! It's like he's in middle-school! (to INU) Look! I can't work with someone who's always picking a fight!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; That's fine with me! I prefer to go it alone.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;I see! You don't need me along then?</p>
<p>KAG walks behind INU. INU's ears twitches, and he looks back.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Hey. Where you going?</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(picking up her school uniform) I've made up my mind. I'm going home. Goodbye, Inuyasha. (walks off)</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (stands up) Going home…? Hey!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;My name is Kagome. Please address me as such.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Hey! Wait!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;It's not &quot;hey&quot;, either.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (yells) Wait, I said! Hey!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(turns around) What?! It's useless to try and stop me.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (appears in front of KAG, with outstretched hand) You got that Jewel piece, right? Leave it.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;You mean this…? (holds up a pouch, and glares at INU for several moments) Sit!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (crashes onto the ground) Why, you…!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;You can't have it. (furming, thinking) I can't believe that guy! Inuyasha has never once addressed me by my name!</p><br>
<p>In the village.</p>
<p class="txt">Woman: This way, Priestess Kaede…</p>
<p class="txt">KAE:&emsp;&ensp;(entering a hut with the woman) She suddenly collapsed?</p>
<p>A girl lays unconscious on a mat.</p>
<p class="txt">Woman: Yes. She was just fine this morning.</p>
<p class="txt">KAE:&emsp;&ensp;I see.</p>
<p>KAE walks towards the girl. Suddenly, strange sounds are heard and KAE stops.</p>
<p class="txt">KAE:&emsp;&ensp;Hmm?! Stay back!</p>
<p class="txt">Woman: Huh?!</p>
<p>The girl suddenly floats in the air but she remains unconscious.</p>
<p class="txt">Woman: She's… floating!</p>
<p>The girl, floating in midair, turns around to face them, with outstretched arms and drooping head. Her hand raise slightly, revealing several strands of hair coiled around her hand.</p>
<p class="txt">KAE:&emsp;&ensp;Hair…?!</p>
<p>A cleaver on the floor starts trembling and flies into the girl's hand. She raises it and attacks.</p><br>
<p>Cut to KAG walking up to the Dry Well.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(thinking) That's how I got here, through the Dry Well. I'm sure I can go back from here. (looks into the well and gasps) Bones…!</p>
<p class="txt">KAE:&emsp;&ensp;(voice-over) That dry well is nicknamed the &quot;Bone-Devouring Well.&quot; It is where the corpses of the dead demons are discarded. After several days, the corpses disappear.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Those are the bones of the Centipede-Monster. (drops her school uniform and squats next to the well) Great. Now I'm afraid to go in. (turns around to look at the sky) Now what?</p>
<p>Something glimmers in the light. A falling leaf is sliced cleanly into two when it passes it. KAG notices and gets up. Something cuts her face. She looks around to find a tangle of very long hair surrounding her.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;It can't be! That's hair!</p>
<p class="txt">Sexy Woman: (appears and stand on a strand of hair) Oh, my! You can see it, then… my web of hair. (cut to close-up of her with hair wrapped around her fingers, like a puppeteer's strings) But being able to &quot;see&quot; it isn't enough…</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Who're you?!</p>
<p>The woman giggles evilly.</p><br>
<p>INU runs through a forest and leaps into the air.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(voice-over) I'm going home. Goodbye, Inuyasha.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (thinking, scoffs) Let her go, who cares?</p>
<p>INU leaps again, entering the village. Several women float in midair in the village square, all unconscious and holding a weapon in their hand. INU lands.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; What's with you all?</p>
<p>One by one the women raise their weapon.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Interesting! Wanna take me on, huh?</p>
<p>The women float towards INU.</p>
<br>
<p>Back to KAG and the sexy woman.</p>
<p class="txt">Sexy woman: They call me &quot;Yura of the Demon-Hair&quot;…though you needn't bother remembering it. Your time's about to run out! (stretches out her hand and several strands of hair reel towards KAG, cutting her) I'm helping myself to the Jewel!</p>
<p>She pulls a strand of hair which takes out KAG's pouch of Sacred Jewel. She opens it to find a fragment.</p>
<p class="txt">Yura:&emsp;Now look what you've done to it. Where are the other fragments?</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Give it back!</p>
<p class="txt">Yura:&emsp;Answer my question! Where are the remaining fragments!?</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;I… I don't know.</p>
<p class="txt">Yura:&emsp;(a sword floats towards her) I see. (takes the sword and jumps towards KAG) In that case…you may as well die!</p>
<p>Yura swings her sword at KAG. KAG steps backwards and falls into the well, screaming. Yura throws her swords in KAG's direction in the well.</p>
<p class="txt">Yura:&emsp;It's useless to try and escape!</p>
<p>Nothing happens. Yura lands on top of the well. Her sword returns to her.</p>
<p class="txt">Yura:&emsp;Gone… (peering into the well) Who was that girl?</p><br>
<p>Back to INU getting ready to fight the floating girls.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Wait a minute! They're all girls from the village. What's going on? Planning to tie me up again? Well, I'm not giving in.</p>
<p class="txt">KAE:&emsp;&ensp;(injured and crawling towards INU slowly) Inuyasha, don't do it! Do not harm the girls!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Old Kaede! (leaps to where KAE is) Wow, look at you. You're a bloody mess.</p>
<p class="txt">KAE:&emsp;&ensp;Have you nothing nicer to say?</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; So why shouldn't I hurt ‘em, huh? They're sure tryin' to hurt me.</p>
<p>The girls close in on INU and KAE.</p>
<p class="txt">KAE:&emsp;&ensp;They're all under a spell. (looks around) Kagome? Where's Kagome?</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; She went back to her own land. Not that it matters or nothin'. I don't need her to handle this.</p>
<p class="txt">KAE:&emsp;&ensp;You mustn't. Do not touch the village girls!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Will you quit flappin' your gums already? Or have you forgotten they're after you, too.</p>
<p class="txt">KAE:&emsp;&ensp;Don't you understand, Inuyasha? We must get to the one who is controlling them.</p>
<p>One of the girls fly at INU and attacks. INU dodges.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Now you've completely lost it.</p>
<p class="txt">KAE:&emsp;&ensp;Then Inuyasha, please… Cut the hair! Just cut the hair and the trance will be broken!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; The what? I don't see anything.</p>
<p>Cut to Yura's hands moving like a puppeteer's, controlling the hair around her fingers. She is sitting calmly on a tree.</p>
<p class="txt">Yura:&emsp;Now, then… Time to draw close this prey.</p>
<p>Back to INU, who attacks one of the girls. She dodges and flies upwards. She raises a cleaver. Other girls also float higher up in the air.</p>
<p class="txt">KAE:&emsp;&ensp;No! Inuyasha, run!</p>
<p>Several strands of hair coil around INU, immobilizing him. Cut to Yura giggling evilly while controlling the strands around her fingers. Back to INU. The floating bodies are controlled by hair, and they move around INU to coil hair around him.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; They're not too smart, whoever's behind this. I may be tangled up, but even if I can't see who's doing it, I can cut down whoever's in front of me!</p>
<p>INU pulls at the hair tangling him. Cut to Yura who let some slack in the hair around her fingers.</p>
<p class="txt">Yura:&emsp;Oh, so sorry!</p>
<p>Cut to INU falling to the ground due to the slack in the hair tangling him. Back to Yura.</p>
<p class="txt">Yura:&emsp;I suppose I've teased you long enough.</p>
<p>Her fingers spread out, making a ‘cat's cradle' hair formation with her fingers. She pulls her hands apart, making the ‘cat's cradle' tighten into a smaller ring. Cut to INU being lifted off the ground and slammed unto a tree. The tension of the hair tightly coiled around his neck and hands are making him wince in pain. He struggles in vain.</p>
<p class="txt">KAE:&emsp;&ensp;Inuyasha…!</p>
<p>Cut to Yura, who spreads out her arms. Many strands of hair come out from her chest. Cut to INU. The grip of the hair on him tightens, making it hard for him to breathe.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Nnyaah! (gathering strength)</p>
<p>INU lets out a yell and pulls at the hair tangling around him and the tree. The tension in the hair tightens and slices the tree trunk, making it break into pieces. The tree falls and INU is released from the hair. Cut to Yura. The hair around her fingers suddenly slack and droop.</p>
<p class="txt">Yura:&emsp;(surprised) The tension's gone. The head must not have been severed. (pissed)</p>
<p>Cut to INU feeling around his neck, gasping for air.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Oh, man… I thought I was done for.</p>
<p class="txt">KAE:&emsp;&ensp;If you'd been a mere human, it would have come clean off.</p>
<p>Some metallic sounds are heard in the background. The two of them look up to find a few villager men, unconscious, floating towards them with weapons in their hands.</p>
<p class="txt">KAE:&emsp;&ensp;The village men!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; More human puppets? It's gettin' kinda old.</p>
<p class="txt">KAE:&emsp;&ensp;Inuyasha, leave this to me and make your escape.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Aw man, would you quit bein' such a martyr an'—</p>
<p>KAE collapses onto the ground.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Old Kaede!</p>
<p class="txt">KAE:&emsp;&ensp;(wincing in pain from her injuries) Inu…yasha…</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Can't be helped.</p>
<p>Cut to Yura on the tree, retrieving the puppet-ting hair. The end of the strand reaches her, and a strand of silver hair is seen.</p>
<p class="txt">Yura:&emsp;Ooh! Such pretty, silver hair.</p>
<p>Cut to INU piggybacking KAE, with close-up of his pretty silver hair.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Hang in there, old woman!</p>
<p class="txt">KAE:&emsp;&ensp;(noticing a web of tight hair in front of them) Be careful, Inuyasha! The hair…</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (leaping through the air, and snapping the hair without feeling anything or getting injured) You say somethin', old woman?</p>
<p class="txt">KAE:&emsp;&ensp;Never mind.</p>
<p>Cut to Yura swinging from tree to tree using three strands of hair as a vine.</p>
<p class="txt">Yura:&emsp;Such a stubborn one. This is fun. And this silver hair… I must have it!</p>
<br>
<p>Evening, in a forest. KAE lies on a heap of fallen leaves, in pain. INU squats next to her.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Old woman, you said you can see the strands! Tell me where it's being pulled from, then.</p>
<p class="txt">KAE:&emsp;&ensp;Don't be ridiculous! With me in this condition, and even with my seeing powers… Hurry… Kagome can—</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; So she can see it, too?</p>
<p class="txt">KAE:&emsp;&ensp;Yes. For this foe, Kagome… Kagome is necessary for victory…</p>
<p>KAE winces in pain and closes her eyes. INU looks at her intently.</p><br>
<p>Evening, in modern day Japan. KAG lays unconscious in a dark pit.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(wakes and looks around) Where is this? (feels the ground) The bottom of the well. That's right… That girl came after me and pushed me into the well.</p>
<p class="txt">GRA:&emsp; (distant voice) We've looked in this well over and over again.</p>
<p class="txt">Sota:&emsp;(distant voice) But I already told you, it's where she fell in!</p>
<p class="txt">GRA:&emsp; You must've been dreaming. (shines a torchlight into the well)</p>
<p class="txt">Sota:&emsp;It's the truth! (looks down into the well to find KAG under the rays of the torchlight)</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Gramps! Sota!</p><br>
<p>Evening in the courtyard of the Higurashi shrine. KAG looks at the scenery outside: the temple structures, telephone poles, shops in the streets.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(thinking) I'm back… Back to my own time.</p>
<p class="txt">GRA:&emsp; (standing behind KAG with SOT) Kagome, you've been gone for three days… We've been so worried.</p>
<p class="txt">Sota:&emsp;Sis, what happened to you?</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(thinking) I'm not dreaming! I'm really home!</p>
<p>KAG's eyes start to tear. She turns around and dives into GRA's arms and wails loudly.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Gramps! I was so scared!</p>
<p class="txt">GRA:&emsp; Kagome… What happened?!</p><br>
<p>Back in the Feudal Era, in a forest. KAE lays on a heap of leaves with her eyes closed and her arms across her, in a serene position. INU is next to her, digging a pit in the ground (like a dog).</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (gets up, in serious tone) Okay… This is it, old woman.</p>
<p>Cut to KAE in the pit, buried under a pile of soil.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (piling more soil onto KAE) Givin' you a decent burial's the least I can do.</p>
<p class="txt">KAE:&emsp;&ensp;Fine. (opens her eyes) Only…I'm not dead yet.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; What I meant was, bury you to hide here. I'll even come back an' dig you out, if I don't forget. (grabs a pile of leaves and spread it on top of the soil)</p>
<p class="txt">KAE:&emsp;&ensp;Are you sure? You had better not forget.</p>
<p>INU gets up and starts to walk away. KAE's hands raise from the ‘grave', pointing at INU.</p>
<p class="txt">KAE:&emsp;&ensp;Do not forget, Inuyasha!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (exasperated) I know! I know!</p>
<p>Cut to INU sprinting across the forest.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Curse that stupid girl! Where'd she run off to, at a time like this??</p><br>
<p>Cut to KAG in a bathtub in her home, having a soak.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(closing her eyes and enjoying the warm water) Happiness at last.</p>
<p>Cut to INU sprinting across the forest. A huge pile of hair flies after INU.</p>
<p>Cut to Yura controlling some hair around her fingers, giggling.</p>
<p class="txt">Yura:&emsp;Wherever she went, she won't get away!</p><br>
<p>Cut to KAG in the shower, combing her wet hair with her fingers.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;It feels so good.</p>
