Sango the demon slayer agrees to join us and hence we set off on our journey. Maybe I'm wrong, but I feel that Miroku is rather happy about this. This time, we arrive in a village plagued with floods. The Water God demands live sacrifices. Why would a god be this evil? But to prevent floods, the villagers obediently hand over their children. This may be the work of a demon with Sacred Jewel! Next episode, 'The God of Water who Governs the Lake of Darkness'!</p>
<p class="header"><a name="1"></a>'Adult Swim' Synopsis</p>
<p>Inuyasha and the others come across a village that has been victimized by a flood, so our heroes go to the temple of the Water God to confront him. The deity proves to be invincible…but is he real? In order to find out, Sango and Miroku must travel to the mountain where the true Water God has been imprisoned.</p>

<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Yes… So let us take it one step at a time… For now, we'll gather the Sacred Jewel fragments.</p>
<p>Cut to close-up of SAN. She has an intense look on her face.</p>

<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Miroku, control yourself!</p>
<p>Cut to SHI floating (nearly out of breath) in his pink balloon form. He reaches the gang and transforms back to his usual self.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Did you find something, Shippo?</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; Just over yonder is a large lake… and there's a huge shrine smack in the middle of it.</p>

<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; How disturbing.</p>
<p>Cut to procession.</p>
<p class="txt">Villager 4: Headman, please reconsider!</p>
<p class="txt">Headman: What are you saying? To protect the village, it's only natural to give up our children.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; What's natural about that?!</p>
<p>Headman, shocked, looks up to find the voice.</p>

<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (Turns to MIR) What're you doing, Miroku?!</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; (Pushing INU aside and speaks to villagers) We are not suspicious folk. We travel around the country coming to the aid of those in need. We heard of your misfortune. If you will allow me, I will exorcise this village.</p>
<p class="txt">Villager 4: Huh?! Can you really do that?</p>
<p class="txt">Villager 5: I think that's a good idea…</p>
<p class="txt">Headman: (Interrupting) No, do not be deceived! They are fakes!</p>
<p class="txt">Villager 4: But headman…Just listen to them…</p>
<p class="txt">Headman: If we rely on shady characters and raise the ire of the Water God, who knows what will happen to our village? Besides, how can I approve an exorcism now when it's my own son's turn to be sacrificed? How will I answer to the other children who went before him?</p>
<p>Cut to palanquin. A masked child peers out of it. Cut to KAG, who senses the child.</p>

<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;(nods) Yes.</p>
<p class="txt">Mysterious voice: Are you serious?</p>

<p class="txt">Mysterious person: Then come with me!</p>
<p>The mysterious person runs along, then pauses.</p>

<p class="txt">Kid:&emsp;&emsp;What're are you doing?!</p>
<p>INU grabs the kid's shirt and pounds him on the head continuously.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Inuyasha, he's just a boy!</p>
<p>INU looks at KAG innocently while he continues pounding the kid.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; He needs to be taught who's stronger.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; (to kid) Hey, apologize even if you won't mean it. Inuyasha can be just like a kid.</p><br>

<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; These are stolen goods. I just know it.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Oh, that's okay.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;It's not okay!</p>
<p class="txt">Kid:&emsp;&emsp;(exasperated) Are you listening?!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(hearing, turns to the kid) Just whose child are you?</p>
<p class="txt">Kid:&emsp;&emsp;(shocked at the question) Humph! It's none of your business.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(walks up to the kid and kneels down) I'll bet you're the real son of the headman.</p>
<p class="txt">Kid:&emsp;&emsp;(taken aback) Oops…!</p>
<p>MIR and INU also walks up and surrounds the kid.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Now that you mention it, the eyebrows look just like that headman's.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Even his cocky manner.</p>
<p>Flashback to the procession in the afternoon. The masked child peers out of the palanquin.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(voice-over) Then the one in the palanquin was a stand-in?</p>
<p class="txt">Kid:&emsp;&emsp;(voice-over) Yes… I am Taromaru, the headman's heir.</p>

<p class="txt">TAR:&emsp;&nbsp; (voice-over) Yet when the white arrow landed upon our roof, he told me to hide.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (voice-over) And he found another child to take your place?</p>
<p>Cut back to night scene in the field.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; (sighing) Such a foolish, doting parent.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (unimpressed) Foolish, period!</p>

<p>Cut to SAN's feet and pans upwards to reveal SAN in battle gear, with Kirara on her shoulder.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;If this human-devouring Water God is allowed to live, my reputation as a Demon Slayer is mud. I'll take care of him alone.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Alone? You're still recovering, so stop acting so tough. I'll bet you can't even wield that heavy weapon yet.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;(serious) Want to try me?</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (riled up and rolls up his sleeves) Anytime!</p>

<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; (raises his palm in a prayer-like stance) Oh well… We received payment for our services. So we must work hard.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Inuyasha, stop alienating people!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (stops rolling up his sleeves and says in an indignant tone) Tell her that! (looks at SAN with a sideway glance) She doesn't want to be part of us!</p>

<p>Cut to gate guards. They look upwards, still in their crab-like defense. While in mid-leap, INU kicks the guards in the face. The guards falls to the ground into a pile. INU lands and gives the guards another kick, sending them away from the gate and out of the frame.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; You're in the way… move!</p>
<p>INU moves up and punches the gate. The gate shatters violently.</p>

<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Calm down!</p>
<p class="txt">Water God: Aha! You appear dirty, but you're actually the headman's son.</p>
<p class="txt">TAR:&emsp;&nbsp; Yes! Now that you know, release Suekichi! I am your human sacrifice!</p>

<p>Water God taps the ground with the trident, and magical waves are emitted. They spread out and hits INU-gang. INU glares in disbelief at the power of the trident. The gang starts to find the waves overwhelming, which quickly changed into water waves. The force of the waves washes everybody away rapidly. The whole place is engulfed in water.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; I'm underwater…! (notices KAG has been knocked unconscious. She is grabbing onto TAR, while SHI is grabbing onto KAG right calf) Kagome!</p>

<p>SHI regains consciousness in the background and sees KAG firing the arrow. The arrow's flight is stopped short when Water God grabs it with his stretched hand. The arrow emits pink rays. Cut to Water God who is thrown aback. The rays melted the flesh on his hand, revealing snake-like skeletal cartilages.</p>

<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; She's swallowed too much water. I must breathe air into her.</p>

MIR has a red palm print on his face, while SAN is furious (eyes squinting and hand shaking) MIR has his back towards SAN and his arms are folded.</p>

<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; But Inuyasha knows that fighting is what will ease your pain right now. That's why he's acting the part of the vengeance seeker. (SAN looks down in a pensive mood) But maybe I'm reading too much into his behavior.</p><br>
<p>The limb of Water God wraps around KAG's ankle and trips her. She falls onto the ground. Cut to a close-up of the trident approaching at high speed. Something stops the trident short. Cut to INU with transformed TET blocking the trident's blow on KAG. KAG looks up.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Inuyasha!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (looking at TET) Damn! (Contact with the trident transformed TET back to its rusty state) (turning to KAG) Kagome… Is everyone safe?</p>
<p>Cut to mid-shot of KAG.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Yes!</p>
<p>Pans sideways. SHI, TAR and SUE emerge from under some planks.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; (pointing) The Water God is escaping!</p>
<p>Cut to Water God who disappears among the mist. Cut to INU running to the edge of the platform.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Where are you, Water God?!</p>
<p>The trident emerges from the water underneath and crashes into the platform. INU's view is blocked by some foam. Water God limb reaches out and grabs INU into the water. Cut to KAG and gang.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Inuyasha! (SHI looks very worried)</p>
<p>Cut to INU bursting out of the surface of the water, gasping for air, and dragged back into the water. Cut to INU enveloped by Water God's body. Water God emerges and rises into the air. Cut to bird's eye view of INU.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; So you've shown your true self! Fake Water God! Without that trident, you're just a lowly creature!</p>
<p>Cut to Water God moving towards INU at high speed.</p>
<p class="txt">Water God: Why you…!</p>
<p>Water God slashes at INU with trident but INU dodges by leaping into the air. The tail of Water God, curled around INU's ankles, drags him DEEP into the water.</p><br>
<p>SAN, MIR and Kirara arrive the rock formation where the real Water God is sealed.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Where is the cave in which the real Water God is held captive?</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; I believe around here…</p>
<p class="txt">A female voice: Is someone there?</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; (surprised) Huh?!</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;A young woman's voice.</p>
<p class="txt">Voice:&ensp; Who is there?</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Could it be… the Water God is a goddess? (MIR's expression change from surprised to serious. SAN is taken aback.)</p>
<p class="txt">Voice:&ensp; Hurry and unseal this cave and free me!</p>
<p>Pans to source of voice, revealing a rock with a piece of paper incantation on it. Cut to MIR kneeling in reverence.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Right away! (gets up and peels off the incantation)</p>
<p>A bright light emits from behind the rock and expands out, blinding everyone. MIR and SAN shield themselves. After the explosion, MIR looks around.</p>
<p class="ttable">Real Water Goddess abbreviated as RWG from now onwards.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Goddess?</p>
<p class="txt">RWG:&emsp;Here.</p>
<p>MIR and SAN look surprised and peer into a small glow. Cut to mid-shot of RWG in her goddess-ly attire. Sound of MIR exclaiming heard. Cut to back view of RWG, zooming out to reveal MIR and SAN peering into a small cave.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; So… beautiful… but… you are so tiny… I couldn't even if I wanted to…</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;(furious) Wanted to what?!</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; (placating SAN) Nothing. (raises up his hand in a prayer stance and closes his eyes) All is vanity.</p><br>

<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(worried) Inuyasha!</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; (sweating) He's not coming up!</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Kagome!</p>
<p>The gang turns around to find MIR (with RWG on his palm), SAN and Kirara rushing towards them.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; You're all okay?!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Inuyasha was dragged underwater!</p>
<p class="txt">RWG:&emsp;Let me down! I shall subdue this fake Water God.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Yes, Water Goddess! (lowering RWG onto the platform)</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Water Goddess?</p>
<p>Cut to RWG taking off one of her earrings (which look like a bunch of red grapes).</p>
<p class="txt">RWG:&emsp;Parting Waters! (throwing the earring into the water)</p>
<p>Cut to underwater. The earring emits light.</p>
<p class="txt">Water God: Hmmm? What…? T-that's…!</p>
<p>The light from RWG's earring explodes and creates a void underwater. Pan up to platform.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; The waters have parted!</p>

<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Why you…! (digs his claws into Water God's back)</p>
<p>Water God turns around and moves away from the platform with INU on his back. Cut to SAN running.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Kirara! (leaps. Kirara transforms and SAN sits nicely on her)</p>
<p>SAN aims her HIR at Water God. It hits.</p>
<p class="txt">Water God: Fool! (HIR returns to SAN) Now you shall feel the power of the Trident of Amakoi! (swings trident high up into the air)</p>
<p>The trident emits a glow and dark clouds start to gather and swirl. Cut to platform.</p>
<p class="txt">TAR:&emsp;&nbsp; The sacred trident is calling forth rain clouds!</p>
<p>Cut to long-shot of Water God with glowing trident high up in the air, while dark clouds gather. Cut to SAN.</p>

<p class="txt">TAR:&emsp;&nbsp; The village will be hit!</p>
<p class="txt">RWG:&emsp;(proud) Calming a twister is a simple matter.</p>
