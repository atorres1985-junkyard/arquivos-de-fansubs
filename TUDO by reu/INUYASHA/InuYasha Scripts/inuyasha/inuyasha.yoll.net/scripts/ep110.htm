<p>Long ago the lord of a nearby castle was responsible for executing the Band of Seven, and now the evil spirits seek their revenge by attacking the castle and reclaiming the weapon used to kill them. Despite warnings, Inuyasha and his friends approach the castle.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Did you notice at one point, Inuyasha was like a baggage counter, holding Kirara, Shippo, Miroku's staff and Sango's Hiraikotsu? (see image)</li>
<li>How is Renkotsu able to read and write well in an era when only the religious and influential people could afford to be literate? And how is it that he knows how to conduct himself as a monk in episodes 104 &amp; 105? This allows for a safe assumption that in Renkotsu's former life, he could have been a monk. For a good reading on this subject, go to The Brains of the Operation at  <span class="contri">{Shichinintai Chaos}</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="ttextb">Comments</p>
<ul><li>I got it now. Probably Naraku uses the barrier of this scared area to hide himself.<br> <i>&mdash; Miroku</i><br> Spoiler ahead, highlight to read: <span class="style1">Miroku, being one of the smartest character in the anime, is the first to guess Naraku's whereabouts correctly. However, due to self doubt, Sesshomaru became the first to figure out his whereabouts</span>.</li></ul></td>

<p>Daytime. On a hill opposite a castle. A man with a braid is trying hard to write a letter with a calligraphy brush. Several pieces of crushed paper lie near him.</p>
<p class="txt">Man:&emsp; Let's see… (groans and crushes paper) This is not good. (throws away paper and writes new one) That's right. Wash your faces… (crushes paper) No way… Damn!</p>
<p>The man throws the paper ball away and buries his face in agony. KOH appears behind him.</p>
<p class="txt">KOH:&emsp;&nbsp;(kneeling politely) Lord Bankotsu, I have your friends here.</p>

<p class="txt">BKS:&emsp;&nbsp; Anyway, Renkotsu. (throws RKS the brush) You're smart, so you should know how to write.</p>
<p class="txt">RKS:&emsp;&ensp;Okay…</p>

<p class="txt">JKS:&emsp;&ensp; Will it be interesting?</p>
<p class="txt">BKS:&emsp;&nbsp; Yeah, it'll be a lot of fun. Everyone, there it is.</p>
<p>The Shichinintai looks at the castle on a mountain. Cut to the Shichinintai in the castle. BKS faces a masked general.</p>
<p class="txt">JKS:&emsp;&ensp; Who is that guy?</p>
<p class="txt">RKS:&emsp;&ensp;He is the Samurai General of this castle.</p>
<p class="txt">JKS:&emsp;&ensp; What's this? Why isn't the Lord here to welcome us?</p>
<p class="txt">General: We need you to assist in attacking the Eastern territory.</p>
<p class="txt">BKS:&emsp;&nbsp; As a frontline soldier?</p>
<p class="txt">General: Shichinintai is so famous, we can't possibly ask you to do servant's work.</p>

<p class="txt">JKS:&emsp;&ensp; (waves) Be careful, Kohaku!</p>
<p>A white and grey butterfly flutters above GKS, who looks at it interestedly. BKS suddenly leaps out and grabs it and holds it out to GKS.</p>

<p>GKS is taken aback.</p>

<p>GKS grunts and looks offended.</p>

<p>BKS lets the butterfly go and the everyone looks at it in silence.</p>
<p class="txt">RKS:&emsp;&ensp;Brother. How's the preparation for attacking the castle?</p>
<p class="txt">BKS:&emsp;&nbsp; Why did we send the warning letter? I want to see their reactions upon receiving the letter. (smirks) I'll let them keep my companion for a little longer.</p><br>
<p>INU-gang is at the foot of Mount Hakurei.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; It's just as Lady Kikyo said.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(thinking) It really is. Is this Mount Hakurei really that serene?</p>
<p>KIR growls and her hair fuzzes out. She transforms back to her cute form.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;What's the matter, Kirara? Kirara?</p>
<p>KIR mews and faints. SHI's eyes are twirly and he looks unwell.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Shippo!</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;(carries KIR) Priest, this is…</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; They're probably affected by the mountain's energy. Especially when Shippo and Kirara are real demons. However, a half-demon like Inuyasha…</p>
<p>MIR hands SHI to KAG. INU walks forward. Static surrounds him and he is unable to move any further.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Inuyasha.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; So this is a barrier?</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; It was probably put up to protect the sacred area. Even so, the barrier is strong enough to purify demonic energy and evil beings. (tense) Even for a human like me could feel the tension of the energy.</p>
<p>KAG and SAN are surprised.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;We don't feel anything.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (eyes MIR) You must have impure thoughts.</p>
<p>SAN and KAG look at each other and nod. They then each hold one of MIR's hand and drag him towards the mountain.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; W-Wait…a minute! (fierce) L-Let me go…let me…</p>
<p>MIR shakes off SAN and MIR, runs to INU and takes a deep breath.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; You've impure thoughts, even though you're a priest.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; (serious) I got it now. Probably Naraku uses the barrier of this scared area to hide himself.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; It's impossible. Naraku's strong demonic energy would be purified instantly if he stepped into this mountain.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; So Naraku shouldn't be in the mountain.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Mount Hakurei's barrier is incredible.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;That's right.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; But, Inuyasha. What should we do now?</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; What do you mean by that?</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; We've been searching for Naraku; but he isn't here.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; The Shichinintai. I'm going to look for those bastards.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; By the way, aren't those guys working for Naraku?</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; All we can do is to catch those bastards and force them to tell us where Naraku is.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; (starts walking off) Well then, let's quickly leave the mountain. Shippo and Kirara seem to be in pain.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;He's lying.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Yeah, he's the one in pain.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; That guy is really full of impure thoughts.</p><br>
<p>INU-gang arrives at a village. They pass by an old villager.</p>
<p class="txt">Old man: Hey, guys! If you guys hang around here, you'll be captured by the men from the castle.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Huh?!</p>
<p class="txt">Old man: All the young people in this area have been taken by soldiers. There's no exceptions for travelers either.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Is there a battle going on?</p>
<p class="txt">Old man: Well… I head that the castle master had received a warning letter.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; A warning letter?</p>
<p class="txt">Old man: Someone is going to steal the castle's treasure.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; What do you mean by treasure?</p>
<p class="txt">Old man: I'm not so sure about it. Anyway, you guys had better hide somewhere… Oh no!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;What's wrong?</p>
<p>The masked general of the castle rides up to the group.</p>
<p class="txt">Old man: It's the castle's Samurai General.</p>
<p class="txt">General: Who are you guys?</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; We're just travelers.</p>
<p class="txt">General: You look suspicious. It's absurd for demons to wander around in broad daylight.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Are you saying that I've done something wrong?</p>
<p>The general thrusts his spear at INU. INU dodges.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Bastard, why did you attack me?!</p>
<p class="txt">General: I won't pardon you next time, impertinent bastard! Get out of here immediately! (rides off)</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; That bastard!</p>
<p class="txt">Old man: Give it up, give it up.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (scoffs) That guy's no big deal!</p>
<p class="txt">Old man: I wonder if it's the Shichinintai.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; The Shichinintai?!</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Old man, do you know anything about them?</p>
<p class="txt">Old man: The Shichinintai were soldiers for hire a long time ago.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Hey, we know that already!</p>
<p class="txt">Old man: The Shichinintai were challenged by the Samurai General before.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; That guy?</p>
<p class="txt">Old man: Even demons are scared of him.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; What should we do? Should we go talk to them?</p>
<p class="txt">Old man: Don't even think about it. If you go near the castle now, you're finished.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(worried) Inuyasha.</p><br>
<p>The Shichinintai are traveling in a forest towards the castle.</p>
<p class="txt">BKS:&emsp;&nbsp; Everyone, there it is.</p>
<p class="txt">SKS:&emsp;&ensp;(angry) It makes me sick.</p>
<p class="txt">JKS:&emsp;&ensp; (furious) You're right.</p>
<p class="txt">BKS:&emsp;&nbsp; Fancy dealing with us in such a cruel way?!</p>
<p><span class="txtb">CUT TO FLASHBACK. </span>The Shichinintai are at a castle.</p>

<p>JKS lashes his sword at some soldiers. Cut to MKS poisoning some soldiers. Cut to KKS beating up some soldiers. Cut to GKS terrorizing some soldiers. Cut to SKS clawing some soldiers. Cut to RKS spewing fire at some soldiers. Cut to the Shichinintai gathered in a valley.</p>
<p class="txt">BKS:&emsp;&nbsp; (laughs) That was simple.</p>
<p class="txt">JKS:&emsp;&ensp; We killed them almost too fast.</p>
<p class="txt">GKS:&emsp;&ensp;You're right.</p>
<p class="txt">JKS:&emsp;&ensp; Those feudal lords weren't our match at all.</p>
<p class="txt">RKS:&emsp;&ensp;Brother. Do you think we'll become feudal lords somewhere soon? No. You could even be a shogun, Brother.</p>
<p class="txt">BKS:&emsp;&nbsp; It'd be a pain.</p>
<p>The group laughs.</p>
<p class="txt">BKS:&emsp;&nbsp; (to RKS) How about you? A feudal lord or shogun?</p>
<p class="txt">RKS:&emsp;&ensp;(self-deprecating) No, it's not going to be my turn yet.</p>
<p class="txt">BKS:&emsp;&nbsp; I'll help you if you want to. I'd love a job where I can kill as many people as possible. I'm excited.</p>
<p class="txt">JKS:&emsp;&ensp; How nice…! I'm excited too.</p>
<p class="txt">SKS:&emsp;&ensp;Killing as many people as possible, until we get bored of it.</p>
<p>The group laughs heartily. A group of soldiers from another castle surround them.</p>
<p class="txt">JKS:&emsp;&ensp; Those guys are really not afraid of death.</p>
<p class="txt">GKS:&emsp;&ensp;Let's smash them up again.</p>
<p class="txt">BKS:&emsp;&nbsp; All right then, let's get to work.</p>
<p>The masked general and his soldiers come up behind the Shichinintai.</p>
<p class="txt">BKS:&emsp;&nbsp; (annoyed) Hey, weren't we supposed to be the frontline soldiers?</p>
<p class="txt">General: You've become a little too famous, Shichinintai.</p>
<p class="txt">BKS:&emsp;&nbsp; Have you decided not to pay us?</p>
<p class="txt">General: You killed too many people. The feudal lords are wondering whether they should just obey you.</p>
<p class="txt">JKS:&emsp;&ensp; Brother!</p>
<p class="txt">RKS:&emsp;&ensp;Brother!</p>
<p class="txt">BKS:&emsp;&nbsp; Do you think you can kill me?</p>
<p class="txt">General: You have nowhere to run. All of the feudal lords are your enemy now.</p>
<p>Snow starts to fall. Soldiers from two more castles surround them.</p>
<p class="txt">RKS:&emsp;&ensp;(rushes to BKS) Brother!</p>
<p class="txt">BKS:&emsp;&nbsp; Run.</p>
<p>The Shichinintai starts to run. The masked general raises his hand and a flurry of arrows fly in Shichinintai's direction.</p>
<p class="txt">General: You're in danger, especially in the era of the Warring States.</p>
<p><span class="txtb">END OF FLASHBACK. </span>BKS scoffs in distaste.</p>
<p class="txt">BKS:&emsp;&nbsp; (looks at the castle) Before I died for the first time, I've killed 999 people. I'm finally about to kill the 1000th. (to the rest) Don't screw this up, you guys!</p>
<p class="txt">JKS:&emsp;&ensp; I've never lost in a real battle!</p>
<p class="txt">BKS:&emsp;&nbsp; You'd better not!</p>
<p>BKS jumps off GKS and runs off ahead.</p>

<p class="txt">BKS:&emsp;&nbsp; (scratches head) I guess Naraku has too many enemies.</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; Where is he?!</p>
<p class="txt">BKS:&emsp;&nbsp; (sighs) Why are you so nervous? (to JKS) Do you think we can trust him?</p>
<p class="txt">JKS:&emsp;&ensp; Why do you ask me? You're the only one who's met the guy.</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; If you don't tell me, I'll kill you!</p>
<p>KOG leaps forth and JKS lashes his blade at him. BKS continues drinking.</p>
<p class="txt">JKS:&emsp;&ensp; (retracts sword) Oh yeah, our fight was only half done!</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; (lands) Idiot! I've already seen through your strange bending sword!</p>
<p>KOG sprints towards JKS. Suddenly, GKS releases a cannonball at KOG. The smoke dissipates and KOG lands.</p>
<p class="txt">RKS:&emsp;&ensp;(irritated) Damn. He dodged it?</p>
<p class="txt">BKS:&emsp;&nbsp; Hey, you're pretty good. Just as I thought, you've got Sacred Jewel fragments in your legs.</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; (clenches fists) Damn it…!</p>
<p class="txt">BKS:&emsp;&nbsp; Naraku asked me to bring those back to him!</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; (thinking) This guy…!</p>
<p>BKS swings his sword at KOG, who leaps and lands on a roof. BKS smirks.</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; (worried, thinking) What? This guy's different from the others.</p>
<p class="txt">BKS:&emsp;&nbsp; Hey, everybody. Don't let him get away.</p>
<p>GKS releases more cannonballs at KOG, who dodges all. SKS then rushes out and claws at KOG, who leaps and dodges. JKS then lashes his sword at him, but in vain.</p>
<p class="txt">BKS:&emsp;&nbsp; (jumps and spins Banryuu) Stop jumping around!</p>
<p>KOG is not in time to dodge Banryuu, and looks at BKS, stupefied.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Get out of the way, wimpy wolf!</p>
<p>INU suddenly rushes out and blocks Banryuu with TET. The blades clash and BKS's hand tremble a little from the impact. BKS looks at INU, surprised.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (lands and points TET) I've found you, Shichinintai.</p>
<p>BKS smirks.</p>

<p class="txtb">[ Preview for next episode ]</p>
<p class="txt">BKS:&emsp;&nbsp; I'm going to avenge my brothers, Kyoukotsu and Mukotsu.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; So you're the leader of the Shichinintai?!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Be careful, Inuyasha. He has three fragments in his neck.</p>
<p class="txt">BKS:&emsp;&nbsp; If you want to know Naraku's whereabouts, you've get past me first!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Naraku finally appeared under the Shichinintai's fierce attacks!</p>
<p class="txt">BKS:&emsp;&nbsp; Sesshomaru? We have to kill this guy too?</p>
