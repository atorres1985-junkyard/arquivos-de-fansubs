Is that true, Kagome? Does the Dark Priestess Tsubaki still possess the Sacred Jewel? That's no fun! Who are they?! Tsubaki's helpers? But the Red Priestess and the White Priestess looks so auspicious! What?! I'm tricking Kagome and Miroku and the others? That's a lie! Next on Inuyasha: &quot;The Red and White Priestesses&quot;.

<p>This episode is native to the anime and doesn't appear in the manga. Hence Momiji and Botan are actually creations from the anime itself.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><b>References</b></p>
<ul><li>Yin Yang<br>     The shrine that Tsubaki, Momiji and Botan study in belongs to the Yin Yang sect. The concept of Yin Yang originates in ancient Chinese philosophy and metaphysics, which describes two opposing but complementary forces found in all things in the universe. <i>Yin</i>, the darker element, is passive, dark, feminine, downward-seeking; <i>yang</i>, the brighter element, is active, light, masculine, upward-seeking. Most forces in nature can be broken down into its respective yin and yang states, and the two are usually in movement rather than held in absolute stasis. Hence it is rather apt that Momiji and Botan form the Yang part, while Tsubaki forms the Yin part, in a way. And Tsubaki herself turned to the dark side. <span class="contri">{Wikipedia}</span> </li>

<p>Night time. TSU walks along a forest path.</p>
<p class="txt">TSU:&emsp;&ensp;(thinking) Why was I beaten?</p>
<p>Cut to flashback of TSU's encounter with KIK a long time ago. KIK turns around coolly and swings her bow at the oncoming Shikigami snake. The snake growls and flies back towards TSU. TSU is shocked as the snake hits her eye. She shrieks. Cut to flashback from previous episode when KAG threw Shikigami back at TSU.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(determinedly) I won't lose to you!</p>
<p>She sits up and hits it with her bow violently.</p>
<p class="txt">TSU:&emsp;&ensp;What?!</p>
<p>Shikigami is thrown backwards and into TSU's eye. TSU shrieks. Back to present.</p>
<p class="txt">TSU:&emsp;&ensp;(thinking) Did I err somewhere? (approaches a structure) No, I've made no mistakes.</p>
<p>Cut to close-up of a yin-yang symbol on the board above the entrance of the structure. TSU stops and looks at the Sacred Jewel in her hand.</p>
<p class="txt">TSU:&emsp;&ensp;(thinking) As long as I have this Sacred Jewel…I will be able to start over and over again!</p>
<p class="txt">Female Voice: Who's there?!</p>
<p>Two girls appear at the entrance, holding up their weapons defensively. One of them is dressed in red, while the other is dressed in blue.</p>
<p class="txt">Red Priestess: Where do you think you are?</p>
<p class="txt">Blue Priestess: If you are human, be gone! If you are a demon, we will slay you!</p>
<p class="txt">TSU:&emsp;&ensp;(firm) Stand back! (takes out a paper from her clothes) I am Priestess Tsubaki. At one time, I trained at this shrine.</p>
<p>The priestesses look at each other.</p><br>
<p class="txtb">[ Title screen: The Red and White Priestesses ]</p><br>
<p>TSU walks in the courtyard of the shrine. She looks around and stops.</p>
<p class="txt">TSU:&emsp;&ensp;How nostalgic. Nothing has changed much since those days.</p>
<p>TSU turns to the two priestesses kneeling behind her.</p>
<p class="txt">Red Priestess: My name is Momiji.</p>
<p class="txt">Blue Priestess: I am Botan.</p>
<p class="ttable">* Momiji abbreviated as MMJ and Botan as BOT from now onwards *</p>
<p class="txt">TSU:&emsp;&ensp;Only you two protect this shrine now?</p>
<p class="txt">MMJ:&emsp;&ensp;We were Master's last disciples.</p>
<p class="txt">TSU:&emsp;&ensp;I see.</p>
<p class="txt">MMJ:&emsp;&ensp;Priestess Tsubaki, you said you were Master's disciple, too. Please pardon my rudeness, but how old are you?</p>
<p class="txt">BOT:&emsp;&ensp;You look so young.</p>
<p class="txt">TSU:&emsp;&ensp;I am much older than you, of course. But this is a result of my training.</p>
<p class="txt">BOT:&emsp;&ensp;Is there a skill to keep one young?</p>
<p class="txt">TSU:&emsp;&ensp;If you continue your training, it will become possible.</p>
<p>MOM and BOT gasp and look at each other.</p>
<p class="txt">TSU:&emsp;&ensp;It's not easy, though.</p>
<p class="txt">BOT:&emsp;&ensp;Priestess Tsubaki, why did you return to this shrine?</p>
<p class="txt">TSU:&emsp;&ensp;I am being pursued by a demon.</p>
<p class="txt">BOT:&emsp;&ensp;Huh? A demon?</p>
<p class="txt">TSU:&emsp;&ensp;(thinking) Now then, what shall I do with these two? Kill them off immediately?</p>
<p class="txt">MMJ:&emsp;&ensp;We will assist, Priestess Tsubaki!</p>
<p class="txt">BOT:&emsp;&ensp;You are our sister disciple!</p>
<p class="txt">TSU:&emsp;&ensp;Hmm…</p><br>
<p>In KAE's hut. Everyone is sleeping. KAG lies on her side, awake. She sits up.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(thinking) I see… After that time… I was under a curse placed by the Dark Priestess Tsubaki.</p>
<p>Cut to flashback of the dark shards entering KAG's body, and KAG firing an arrow at INU. Back to present. INU, seated in a corner of the room, looks at KAG.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Hey… Feel all right?</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Yes, I'm okay.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; (sits up suddenly) Kagome?</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; (wakes) Kagome?</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;(wakes and gets up) Kagome!</p>
<p class="txt">KAE:&emsp;&ensp;(wakes and sits up) Kagome!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(waves her hands and smiles uneasily) Look… I'm all right!</p><br>
<p>INU-gang sit around the fireplace. KAE ladles some stew into a bowl.</p>
<p class="txt">KAE:&emsp;&ensp;The sorceress who placed the curse is named Tsubaki. Fifty years ago, she was a priestess equal in status to my sister, Kikyo. (hands the bowl to SAN)</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Why did she turn into an evil priestess?</p>
<p class="txt">KAE:&emsp;&ensp;(shakes her head) I do not know. Perhaps the name is just a coincidence.</p>
<p>KAG pauses.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; What's the matter?</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;I sense the presence of the Sacred Jewel Shard.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Are you sure, Kagome?</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Yes, I feel it very distinctly.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; It was a huge shard.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (stands, worked up) And? Which way is it?</p><br>
<p>Outside KAE's hut. It is daytime. KAG points to a direction and the rest of INU-gang look in that direction.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;That way.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; We have no choice but to go.</p>
<p class="txt">KAE:&emsp;&ensp;(walks to the group with a horse) Yes, in order to get the Sacred Jewel back, we must not miss this opportunity.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; What, Kaede?! You mean to follow us?</p>
<p class="txt">KAE:&emsp;&ensp;The enemy is a Dark Shrine Maiden! Isn't it better if I, a shrine maiden, came along?</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (sarcastic) Are you a shrine MAIDEN even when you're old?</p>
<p class="txt">KAE:&emsp;&ensp;(closes her eyes) Kagome!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(closes her eyes) Inuyasha, sit!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (crashes to the ground) Arghh!</p>
<p class="txt">KAE:&emsp;&ensp;Impudent fellow!</p>
<p>KAG bows her head slightly. Cut to KAE on the horse with her bow and arrows.</p>
<p class="txt">KAE:&emsp;&ensp;Let us go!</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Let's go, Kirara!</p>
<p>SAN and MIR are on KIR. KIR flies into the sky.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(helps INU up from the ground) Hey, Inuyasha.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Why you…!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(sits on INU's back) That way!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Okay…</p>
<p>INU leaps off, revealing a flattened SHI underneath.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; (runs after INU) Hey! Don't forget me!</p><br>
<p>Flashback of a kid TSU kneeling and praying in front of an altar with her Master. TSU is concentrating.</p>
<p class="txt">Master: (looks at TSU) You learn quickly, Tsubaki.</p>
<p class="txt">Kid TSU: (glad) Really, Master?</p>
<p class="txt">Master: Yes.</p>
<p>Kid TSU smiles.</p>
<p>Cut to present. TSU stands in front of the same altar and examines it.</p>
<p class="txt">TSU:&emsp;&ensp;(scoffs) Humph! Sixty years have passed. It's only natural that my teacher is dead.</p>
<p class="txt">MMJ:&emsp;&ensp;Priestess Tsubaki!</p>
<p>TSU turns around to find MMJ and BOT kneeling in front of her.</p>
<p class="txt">TSU:&emsp;&ensp;Special charms unique to this shrine would keep out any demons. (looks up) Where could they be?</p>
<p class="txt">MMJ:&emsp;&ensp;Please leave that to us, Priestess Tsubaki.</p>
<p class="txt">BOT:&emsp;&ensp;(determined) Even if we cannot slay them, we can at least hamper them.</p>
<p class="txt">TSU:&emsp;&ensp;Can you? The enemy is a terrible, evil demon.</p>
<p class="txt">MMJ:&emsp;&ensp;We have trained hard and long, too. It is our duty to fight demons.</p>
<p class="txt">TSU:&emsp;&ensp;Then I shall leave it to you. Give me as much time as possible.</p>
<p class="txt">MMJ &amp; BOT: (nod) Yes!</p><br>
<p>In a storeroom. MMJ and BOT search through the barrage of chests and treasures, and throw some things away. They gather some small boxes, scrolls, charms and a dragon statue, and place them on a piece of cloth on the floor.</p>
<p class="txt">BOT:&emsp;&ensp;(wipes off the sweat on her forehead) How's this, Momiji?</p>
<p class="txt">MMJ:&emsp;&ensp;I think this will do fine, Botan.</p>
<p class="txt">BOT:&emsp;&ensp;(pressing her fingers nervously) It's our first time…</p>
<p class="txt">MMJ:&emsp;&ensp;(clenches fist in determination) All the more reason for just doing it!</p>
<p class="txt">BOT:&emsp;&ensp;(convinced) Yes! It's all part of training and experience, right?</p>
<p>MMJ and BOT slam the door open and walk out of the room with the treasures slung over their shoulders.</p>
<p class="txt">MMJ:&emsp;&ensp;Onward!</p>
<p class="txt">BOT:&emsp;&ensp;To slay the demon!</p>
<p>MMJ and BOT march across the courtyard. TSU spy on them from behind a structure and smiles as they move out of sight. She turns around and walks off.</p><br>
<p>In front of a pagoda, in the forest behind the shrine. TSU walks up to the stairs and looks up at it. Cut to flashback of kid TSU with her master looking at the pagoda.</p>
<p class="txt">Master: You must never open these doors. This is the Forbidden Pagoda of Many Treasures.</p>
<p class="txt">Kid TSU gaze at the pagoda in awe. Fade to present.</p>
<p class="txt">TSU:&emsp;&ensp;Forbidden, huh?</p>
<p>A strong gust of wind suddenly blows. TSU turns around to find a whirlwind, which quieten down to reveal KAR.</p>
<p class="txt">TSU:&emsp;&ensp;(shocked) Why you…?</p>
<p class="txt">KAR:&emsp;&nbsp; Naraku wants the Sacred Jewel back.</p>
<p class="txt">TSU:&emsp;&ensp;This belongs to me!</p>
<p class="txt">KAR:&emsp;&nbsp; Didn't he promise to give it to you, only IF you fulfilled his wish?</p>
<p class="txt">TSU:&emsp;&ensp;I will fulfil his wish! By using this Sacred Jewel. That Kagome… and Inuyasha… I'll kill them all!</p>
<p class="txt">KAR:&emsp;&nbsp; How? You lost to them once already.</p>
<p class="txt">TSU:&emsp;&ensp;(looks at the pagoda) There is power here. Power that I can harvest with this Sacred Jewel.</p>
<p class="txt">KAR:&emsp;&nbsp; Doesn't sound very hopeful at all. Shall I tell you something very interesting?</p>
<p class="txt">TSU:&emsp;&ensp;What is it?</p>
<p class="txt">KAR:&emsp;&nbsp; (sly) The ultimate way to use the Sacred Jewel.</p>
<p>TSU is taken aback.</p>
<p class="txtb">[ End of ACT I: 8min 40sec ]</p><br>
<p class="txtb">[ ACT II ]<a name="_ACT_II_"></a></p>
<p>INU-gang ride and run across a plain.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Over there!</p>
<p>INU grunts. KIR growls.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;What's the matter, Kirara?</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; That's…!</p>
<p>KIR lands and MIR and SAN get off her. KIR reverts to her cute form. Tall poles with strings of charms have been put up on the grass plain in front of the shrine. INU, KAG, SHI and KAE reach them.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; What is it?!</p>
<p class="txt">KAE:&emsp;&ensp;A barrier! (gets off horse) A barrier we put up to prevent demons from entering.</p>
<p>SHI jumps off the horse.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Is it Tsubaki's doing?</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(points in front) I sense the Sacred Jewel beyond this barrier.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (marches towards the barrier) Keh! I'll  tear apart this stupid barrier!</p>
<p>INU steps on a small stick with a charm on the ground and gets electrified. He falls backwards dramatically and winces.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (furious) Oww! What IS this?!</p>
<p>SHI walks up to INU and moves apprehensively towards the charm on the ground. He points a finger at it slowly and gets electrified when he touches the charm. He winces and freezes in motion.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; (walks to SHI and INU and picks up the charm easily) Hey, this isn't the time to be playing. It's a barrier against demons. (looks at the long string of charms) Just leave the barrier to Kaede and myself.</p>
<p class="txt">KAE:&emsp;&ensp;Uh-huh!</p>
<p class="txt">MMJ:&emsp;&ensp;(in the background) So you appeared, Demon!</p>
<p>INU-gang turns around to look as MMJ and BOT pop out of two boulders a distance in front of them. They jump onto the boulder, holding staffs in their hands defensively.</p>
<p class="txt">BOT:&emsp;&ensp;We have been waiting for you!</p>
<p class="txt">MMJ:&emsp;&ensp;Are you Inuyasha, the demon who seeks to destroy Priestess Tsubaki?</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; What?! Are you Tsubaki's cronies?</p>
<p class="txt">MMJ:&emsp;&ensp;Priestess Tsubaki is a sister disciple!</p>
<p class="txt">BOT:&emsp;&ensp;It's only natural to be her ally!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; So you're Dark Priestess, too? (flexes his claws) I won't spare you either, then.</p>
<p class="txt">MMJ:&emsp;&ensp;D-Dark Priestesses?!</p>
<p class="txt">BOT:&emsp;&ensp;(furious) How dare you insult us!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; So you aren't Dark Priestesses?</p>
<p class="txt">MMJ:&emsp;&ensp;Don't be ridiculous, Demon!</p>

<p class="txt">MMJ:&emsp;&ensp;I am Momiji!</p>
<p>Cut to close up of BOT posing against bunches of peony flowers.</p>
<p class="txt">BOT:&emsp;&ensp;And I am Botan!</p>
<p class="txt">MMJ:&emsp;&ensp;We are priestesses who trained hard in the art of slaying demons!</p>
<p class="txt">BOT:&emsp;&ensp;Do not even mention us in the same breath as the Dark Priestess!</p>
<p>Cut to INU-gang.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;They seem to be on the side of justice…</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Aren't they Tsubaki's helpers?</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; (steps forward, in cajoling tone) Now, now you two. Just wait a minute.</p>
<p class="txt">MMJ:&emsp;&ensp;Silence! (points at MIR) From your appearance, you seem to be a monk! (points at SAN) And you are a demon slayer! (points at KAG) And you… (pauses and squats down with BOT to discuss with her) Look at those strange clothes! But she seems to have power.</p>
<p class="txt">MMJ &amp; BOT: (both point at KAG) You must be a priestess!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(blushes a little, scratching her cheek with a finger) Well, I guess you could say that.</p>
<p class="txt">MMJ &amp; BOT: (both look pleased at each other at the correct guess they made, continue to point at KAG) So why do you side with such demons?! (points at INU, SHI, cute KIR, and KAE)</p>

<p>MMJ and BOT look at SHI and KIR. KIR meows in a cute and harmless tone.</p>

<p class="txt">BOT:&emsp;&ensp;(confused) What'll we do?</p>
<p class="txt">MMJ:&emsp;&ensp;(confused) What'll we do?</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;What'll we do? They don't seem to be bad.</p>
<p>INU scoffs indignantly.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; We have to convince them somehow. (calls to MMJ and BOT gently) Hello there, you two!</p>
<p class="txt">MMJ &amp; BOT: We get it! (stand up suddenly and point at SHI)</p>
<p class="txt">MMJ:&emsp;&ensp;Demon! You've disguised your appearance!</p>
<p class="txt">SHI turns around to look at the rest, and turns back to MMJ and BOT. He tumbles a few steps to his left, but MMJ and BOT's fingers continue to point at him. He tumbles back to the right and the pointing continues.</p>

<p class="txt">MMJ:&emsp;&ensp;(determined) We will not be fooled by what we see!</p>
<p>Cut to close-up of SHI against a black background, looking very, very shocked and upset.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; (steps back slowly and puts a hand across his face) Is it… Is it my fault?!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Stop acting so scared, Shippo!</p>

<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; I will explain why we're with those demons.</p>
<p>Screen closes up on MIR's face, looking very serious.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; It all started with the existence of the Sacred Jewel.</p>
<p>Screen zooms out and shows MIR groping MMJ and BOT's butt, who are both trembling in shock and fear.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; The demon coveted its power.</p>
<p>MMJ and BOT shriek loudly. The screen blacks out and thumping sounds are heard. Scene revert to normal with MIR sitting on the grass with two slap-marks imprinted on his face.</p>
<p class="txt">MMJ:&emsp;&ensp;Why you!</p>
<p class="txt">BOT:&emsp;&ensp;You've sold your soul to the demon!</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; (raising his right Wind Tunnel hand weakly, head bowed low in shame) My hand… My hand is possessed by the demon.</p>

<p>SAN closes her eyes and bow her head low angrily.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(clenches her fists in anger) What're you thinking?! Going off course like that!</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Err…sorry about that. I just…</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (runs forward and shouts) Is Tsubaki over yonder?</p>
<p class="txt">MMJ:&emsp;&ensp;We will not let you pass! Go!</p>
<p>MMJ and BOT throw out some paper charms which morph into human shapes. These paper dolls begin to stomp towards INU-gang, shrieking in a synthetic kiddy voice. INU draws out his sword and KAG reaches for her arrow. By the time the paper dolls reaches INU-gang, they appear no taller than KAG's shoes. INU-gang looks surprised as the pieces of paper doll run towards them. KAG kicks the first one that reaches her. It shrieks and falls over.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(unimpressed) What is this?</p>
<p class="txt">KAE:&emsp;&ensp;Paper spirits, Shikigami. It's a spell in which paper dolls are given souls which they control.</p>
<p>INU swings his transformed TET and the paper dolls near him are torn into pieces. SHI squats and uses his fox fire to burn the five paper dolls in front of him. The paper dolls jump around from the fire.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; They're very weak.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; (squats, swings his staff on the grass and knocks over the paper dolls) We can't take them seriously, can we?</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;(kicks a paper doll near her) I agree.</p>
<p>KIR, untransformed, is using her paw to smack on the paper doll near her, as if it's a cat's toy. INU swings TET at the paper dolls near him and shattered all of them without effort.</p>
<p class="txt">MMJ:&emsp;&ensp;(confident) You're not bad, all of you.</p>
<p>Two paper dolls run back towards MMJ and BOT and each leaps onto their shoulders with a thread</p>
<p class="txt">MMJ:&emsp;&ensp;That was just a red herring. (takes the white thread from the paper doll on her shoulder)</p>
<p class="txt">BOT:&emsp;&ensp;In order to get strands of your hair. (takes the black thread from the paper doll on her shoulder)</p>
<p class="txt">KAE:&emsp;&ensp;(shocked, knees buckling for a moment) Huh?! They didn't…!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;What is it, Kaede?</p>
<p class="txt">KAE:&emsp;&ensp;You intend to transfer our bodies into those Shikigami.</p>
<p class="txt">BOT:&emsp;&ensp;Very clever, Demon!</p>
<p class="txt">KAE:&emsp;&ensp;(raises a fist half-heartedly) I am a priestess!</p>
<p>MMJ and BOT do a series of actions at the same time: take out a piece of sutra paper, put the hair strands in, fold the papers into half, then a quarter and flings the paper into the air. The papers spin in the air and a magical transformation takes place. INU-gang looks on.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Transfer our bodies? But whose?</p>
<p class="txt">KAE:&emsp;&ensp;I don't know.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Whoever it is, I'll smash them apart!</p>
<p>The folded papers begin to take into the shapes of humans and grow bigger than the INU-gang.</p>
<p class="txt">KAE:&emsp;&ensp;W-What is that?</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; It can't be!</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;I think it can…</p>
<p>One of the paper doll begins to take the shape of INU and a very tall, fat and spiteful looking INU appears. He looks like a large inflated toy version of INU.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; Inuyasha?!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (agitated) I'm not like that!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(looks to the other doll) T-Then…is…that…?</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; It is…</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;It is!</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; But…</p>
<p>Screen reveals a very large and duh-looking KAG with bow and arrow.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; Isn't that you, Kagome?</p>
<p>The screen zooms out to reveal the pair of balloon INU and KAG. Balloon-INU clenches his fist and raises them up slowly. Balloon-KAG shakes her fists excitedly and slowly.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(furious, shouts loudly) No! I don't look like that!</p><br>
<p>Back to KAR and TSU at the pagoda. TSU kneels in front of a fire with eyes closed and hands in prayer position. KAR looks on from behind, leaning against a tree trunk.</p>
<p class="txt">KAR:&emsp;&nbsp; (unimpressed) Pretty elaborate ceremony, huh? Is the seal that strong?</p>
<p class="txt">TSU:&emsp;&ensp;(opens her eyes) This one is to open the door. There are even stronger seals further in. (closes her eyes)</p>
<p>KAR lets out a 'I give up' sigh.</p><br>
<p>Back to INU-gang, who face off with the Balloon-INU and Balloon-KAG. MMJ and BOT clasp each other's hands proudly and press their bodies together, in a pop-star pose.</p>
<p class="txt">MMJ:&emsp;&ensp;Botan, we did good!</p>
<p class="txt">BOT:&emsp;&ensp;And they look cute, Momiji!</p>
<p>MMJ and BOT turn to INU-gang.</p>
<p class="txt">BOT:&emsp;&ensp;Well? Are you shocked?</p>
<p class="txt">MMJ:&emsp;&ensp;It's not only shape and form. Even the power has been transferred totally intact!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; It doesn't look like me!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;It's nothing like me!</p>
<p class="txt">MMJ &amp; BOT: Go!</p>
<p>Balloon-INU and KAG run towards INU-gang slowly, the ground shaking from their weight.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Blasted tricks! (jumps and raise his claws) Iron Reaver, Soul Stealer!</p>
<p class="txt">Balloon INU: (raise his claws) Iron Reaver…Soul Stealer!</p>
<p>Balloon-INU punches INU out of the way. INU crashes on the ground. Balloon-KAG draws a sacred arrow and shoots it at INU, who leaps and dodges. Balloon-INU and Balloon-KAG raise their hands in victory positions.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Don't get in the way, Kagome!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Stop calling that THING my name!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (runs towards Balloon-INU) Damn!</p>
<p>Balloon-INU runs towards INU too.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(thinking) I know! If that Shikigami is supposed to be Inuyasha… (shouts) Sit!</p>
<p>INU crashes to the ground and Balloon-INU rushes forward to step on him. INU lets out a groan. SAN swings HIR at Balloon-INU nonchalantly and Balloon-INU jumps away from INU to dodge HIR. HIR returns to SAN. INU shoots up and swings his fist at KAG angrily.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Kagome! What're you doing?!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(apologetic) Sorry!</p>
<p class="txt">KAE:&emsp;&ensp;Not all of the powers of the host seems to be transferable.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Keh! (turns to Balloon-INU) It's still just a fake! (lowered spiteful voice) Although, I'm a bit jealous. (draws TET which transforms)</p>
<p>Balloon-INU draws his sword too, but it is a rubbery looking yellow and blunt sword. INU sniggers childishly.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (jeering) What's with that sword?! I'm coming!</p>
<p>INU runs towards Balloon-INU, but steps on one of the small charms on the ground and gets electrified. Balloon-KAG takes the chance to shoot an arrow at INU. INU blocks the arrow with TET. He shakes angrily in frustration and points TET at Balloon-KAG.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (turns to KAG) Kagome! Do something about that Kagome!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Don't call it my name, I said! (points at Balloon-INU) And why don't YOU do something about that Inuyasha!?</p>
<p>Balloon-KAG does a victory dance.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; That ain't me!</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Oh dear, I guess it can't be helped…</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;We'll take care of it.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Still…</p>
<p>SAN and MIR face off with Balloon-INU and Balloon-KAG. INU-gang stand a distance behind them.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; I feel a bit hesitant.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Miroku, can you take care of &quot;Kagome&quot;?</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(shouts) Don't call it Kagome!</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; No, I'll take care of &quot;Inuyasha&quot;.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (shouts) That's not me!</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;I can fight &quot;Inuyasha&quot; without reservations.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (shouts and waves TET madly) What does that mean?!</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; (turns to INU uneasily) Well, just that…</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (runs to SAN and MIR) Move! You guys! (SAN and MIR step aside) I'll get rid of them with my Wind Scar!</p>
<p>A wind vortex start to surround TET.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; On guard!</p>
<p>MMJ and BOT both take out a charm, make a gesture and point it upwards. INU suddenly freezes, unable to move.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; M-My body…!</p>
<p class="txt">MMJ:&emsp;&ensp;Well, Demon?</p>
<p class="txt">BOT:&emsp;&ensp;We'll seal your movements!</p>
<p>MMJ and BOT close their eyes in concentration. Both KIR and SHI fall to the ground and shriek.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Shippo!</p>
<p>Both MMJ and BOT are taken aback.</p>
<p class="txt">BOT:&emsp;&ensp;(to MMJ) Oh no! That cute little one is in pain, too!</p>
<p class="txt">MMJ:&emsp;&ensp;It can't be helped. It's a demon, too.</p>
<p class="txt">KAE:&emsp;&ensp;Enough, you two!</p>
<p class="txt">BOT:&emsp;&ensp;(gasps) That demon is still moving!</p>
<p class="txt">MMJ:&emsp;&ensp;Go!</p>
<p class="txt">Balloon-INU &amp; KAG: We're going.</p>
<p>Balloon-INU and KAG march forward but SAN and MIR rush in front of them. Balloon-INU and KAG stop.</p>
<p class="txt">MMJ:&emsp;&ensp;If you get in our way, we'll get rid of you, too!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Hey! Stop already! We haven't done anything bad!</p>
<p class="txt">KAE:&emsp;&ensp;(rushes to MIR) Monk, let us subdue those two maidens first.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; I guess we have no choice.</p>
<p>Balloon-INU raise his sword and swings it downwards at MIR and KAE, who dodges to the side.</p>
<p class="txt">BOT:&emsp;&ensp;Do not interfere with us!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (struggling) Why you…! Enough already!</p>
<p>MMJ and BOT make a gesture again and INU falls lower to the ground, struggling.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; If you don't cut it out…!</p>
<p>Balloon-KAG shoots another arrow at INU, who blocks it with TET barely. Balloon-INU then swings his sword downwards at INU, who bocks with TET again.</p>
<p class="txt">BOT:&emsp;&ensp;Stubborn demon!</p>
<p class="txt">MMJ:&emsp;&ensp;We won't lose either!</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;You there! Watch out! (swings HIR at MMJ and BOT)</p>
<p>MMJ and BOT shriek and squat to the ground to dodge HIR. HIR returns to SAN. SHI and KIR suddenly jump up.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; I'm free…!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (fending off Balloon-INU) Why you…!</p>
<p>INU manage to push Balloon-INU backwards, who fall and crash unto the ground. Balloon-KAG runs to Balloon-INU to see if he's okay. Balloon-INU makes a groaning sound.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (swings TET) Take that!</p>
<p>INU does a Wind Scar. Balloon-INU and Balloon-KAG look on in shock as the waves of the Wind Scar travel towards them and completely disintegrates them. MMJ and BOT are thrown off from the impact, shrieking in terror. They crash to the ground and lose consciousness.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (breathing heavily) How's that?</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; (rushes to MMJ and BOT) They've just fainted. Their lives aren't in danger. And they don't seem to be hurt…</p>
<p>Scene zoom out to reveal MIR groping MMJ and BOT's butt, one with each hand. SAN appear behind him and twists his ear.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Owwee! (stops groping and stand up from SAN's pulling)</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(walks to MMJ and BOT with SHI and KIR) What'll we do with these two?</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; When they come to, will they attack us again?</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Tsubaki tricked them or sweet talked them. In any case, I think they'd understand if we explain it thoroughly.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; And who's gonna take on such a silly task?</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; (raise his hand) Naturally, me!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Huh?</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; I will take them both in and explain in detail.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(nice tone) Shippo, will you stay with Miroku?</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; Me? But what am I to do?</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;(nice tone) All you have to do is keep an eye on Miroku.</p>
<p>MIR lets out a disappointed gasp.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Besides, it'll be easy for you to convince them that you're not a bad demon.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; I must be strong and alert!</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Kirara, you stay, too.</p>
<p>KIR mews.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Do as you please! I'm going after Tsubaki! (runs off)</p>
<p class="txt">KAE:&emsp;&ensp;Hey, Inuyasha!</p>
<p>INU runs towards the long strings of charms and gets electrified. INU falls on the ground with smoke emitting from him.</p>
<p class="txt">KAE:&emsp;&ensp;(walks past INU slowly) Wait until I bring down the barrier.</p><br>
<p>Back to KAR and TSU.</p>
<p class="txt">TSU:&emsp;&ensp;(opens her eyes) It will open soon.</p>
<p class="txt">KAR:&emsp;&nbsp; Just what's inside there anyway?</p>
<p class="txt">TSU:&emsp;&ensp;A demon.</p>
<p>Fade to flashback of kid TSU standing in front of the pagoda with her master.</p>
<p class="txt">Master: 100 years ago, the head priest lost many of his men and it was all he could do to seal it in the Pagoda…</p>
<p class="txt">TSU:&emsp;&ensp;This demon… There's such a frightening demon inside?</p>
<p class="txt">Master: Generation after generation has taken turns making sure the door remained sealed. Tsubaki, in time, you will be given this duty.</p>
<p class="txt">TSU:&emsp;&ensp;Yes, Master!</p>
<p class="txt">Master: You must never open it. It is the forbidden Pagoda!</p>
<p>Cut to present. The door of the pagoda swing open slowly.</p>
<p class="txt">TSU:&emsp;&ensp;(walks up the steps) The demon sealed inside this forbidden Pagoda is enormously strong.</p>
<p class="txt">KAR:&emsp;&nbsp; (follows TSU) However… You intend to use the Sacred Jewel to make him heed your orders?</p>
<p class="txt">TSU:&emsp;&ensp;(enters the pagoda) Yes, I'll use it! I don't intend it all to end yet!</p><br>
<p>INU-gang runs in the forest towards the shrine.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; I can see something!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;I feel the Sacred Jewel just ahead!</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Is Tsubaki there?!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Keh!</p>
<p>INU reaches the gate and is caught up in a barrier between the doors.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; W-What is this?!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Inuyasha!</p>
<p class="txt">KAE:&emsp;&ensp;Even the gate has a barrier!</p>
<p>INU continues to struggle and finally breaks through. The charm on the door frame burns.</p>
<p class="txt">KAE:&emsp;&ensp;He's so reckless!</p><br>
<p>INU-gang enter the courtyard.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Come on out, Tsubaki!</p>
<p>INU-gang looks around and gasps when they notice a huge red glow emitting from the forest behind the shrine.</p>

<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;What is that pagoda? Did Tsubaki escape into that?</p>
<p class="txt">TSU:&emsp;&ensp;What am I lacking?</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;That’s Kagura! So Naraku and Tsubaki are in cahoots after all!</p>
