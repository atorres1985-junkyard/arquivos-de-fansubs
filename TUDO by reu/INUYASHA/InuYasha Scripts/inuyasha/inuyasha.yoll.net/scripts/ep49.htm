Kohaku appears near where an old couple lives, but a demon appears too! His intention is to take the Sacred Jewel fragment! We chanced upon the scene and saved Kohaku. We hid Kohaku but he has forgotten all about Sango and the Demon Slayers…! What's with him? Is Naraku plotting something again? Next episode, 'Kohaku's Lost Memory'!</p>
<p class="header"><a name="1"></a>'Adult Swim' Synopsis</p>
<p>Kohaku, Sango's younger brother, has lost his memories and is being taken care of by an elderly couple. When a hoard of demons attacks the village, Kohaku flees to protect his saviors. Kagome, who has returned to feudal Japan, senses Kohaku's shards nearby and the group arrives just in time to save him. But then, Kagura attacks.</p>

<p class="ttextb">Oddities</p>
<ul><li>When Sango was digging out the burial ground of the slayers, only pieces of armour were seen. Sango first joined the group in episode 26, and only saw Inuyasha turned full-demon once, in episode 44, meaning less than a month has passed. How could the bodies of the demon slayers have rotted so fast?</li>
<li>Kirara is missing in the first 90sec of the animation, and then she suddenly appears. When Haachi the tanuki transport the group on his back, Kirara is nowhere to be seen. When the group lands on the grounds on Naraku's previous castle, she was missing too.</li></ul>
<p class="ttextb">Comments</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Inuyasha: You're being blinded by love for your kid brother!<br>Sango: Shut up! What would you know?!</p>
<p>Yes, indeed, how would Inuyasha know about being blinded by love for a sibling when his own brother, Sesshomaru, is always creating trouble for him?</p>

<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; (sighs and look upwards into the sky, thinking) He seems to be repenting just a bit.</p>

<p>INU-gang stand on a dry and desolate ground with ruined stone walls.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; This is where Naraku's castle used to be?</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Traces of Naraku's miasma still remain. So there's no mistake.</p>
<p>SAN looks intently around her.</p>
<p>Cut to later, INU and SHI walk toward HAA and Miroku, who is squatting and examining a spot.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; But…there's nary a hint of the remains. Was Naraku's castle really here?</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; (stands) You're right. When you think about it, we've been lured to a fake castle before.</p>
<p>Cut to KAG looking disappointed and squatting.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(throws a pebble onto the ground) Was what we saw just an illusion?</p>
<p>Behind her, SAN examines a hole in the ground with KIR.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;No, you're wrong.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Huh? (stands up and turns around) Sango!</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;(turns to KAG) There's no mistake. Naraku's castle was here.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Huh? Sango, what's…?</p>
<p>SAN picks up a piece of an armour buried in the hole. INU and MIR walk toward the girls.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; What's up? Found something?</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;(looking at the armour in her hand) My father's armour.</p>
<p>Flashback from episode 24, where the Demon Slayers fell into Naraku's trap.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;(voice-over) That day, we slayers were lured to Naraku's castle.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Hiraikotsu! (attacks the spider demon)</p>
<p class="txt">KOH:&emsp;&nbsp;Me, too!</p>
<p>KOH runs forward with his sickle-chain. A string lodges in the back of his neck and he gradually stops walking. Cut to the slayers slashed by KOH's sickle chain. SAN gasps. KOH attacks his father. Cut to SAN blocking KOH's attacks on her.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;(voice-over) And my father and all the others were slain. They were killed by my younger brother, Kohaku. His mind was being controlled by Naraku.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Huh?! (notices the thread on KOH neck leading to the lord of the castle)</p>
<p>SAN rushes towards the lord, but is struck in the back by KOH's sickle. She stops and looks behind her. KOH falls onto his knees and stares at his hands.</p>
<p class="txt">KOH:&emsp;&nbsp;(trembling voice) Sister!</p>
<p>Cut to KOH killed by the arrows of the lord's servants.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Kohaku!</p>
<p>Back to present. The group stand around SAN, who looks into the hole buried with pieces of armour.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Their bodies were buried in the corner of the courtyard. So this is…</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Sango…</p>
<p>MIR walks forward and reaches for the sash around his clothes.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Miroku?</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; (unties the sash) We must not leave your father and the others in this tainted ground.</p>
<p>MIR kneels and place his sash on the ground. He picks up the armour pieces and places them onto the sash.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Miroku…</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; We will find another burial ground for them and offer prayers. Is that all right?</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Yes, thank you. Miroku.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(thinking) So this is where Naraku's castle was… But what of its occupants? Sango's brother, Kohaku…who was controlled by Naraku. Did he perish with the castle?</p><br>
<p>The group gathers around a cliff. A huge boulder sits at the edge. The group, except INU, offers their prayers.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Here, at least, wild dogs won't dig up their graves.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Let this be your resting place for now.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;(places a bunch of flowers near the boulder, thinking) Someday, I promise to erect proper graves for you in our village. The village is abandoned now. But Kohaku and I are still alive. If we both watch over the graves…</p>
<p>Cut-scene of KOH falling. He screams and reaches out his hand. An image of NAR fades in.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;(voice-over) But Kohaku is…</p><br>
<p>Daytime in a small village. KOH is chopping wood with his sickle chain. He throws a log in the air and chops it. One half lands on his raised foot and the other on his head. He balances them and turns to an old couple who are watching him.</p>
<p class="txt">KOH:&emsp;&nbsp;Here!</p>
<p class="txt">Old woman: (clapping) Ohh!</p>
<p class="txt">Old man: (clapping) Kid, you're pretty good!</p>
<p>KOH chuckles and kicks the wood pieces onto the pile of chopped wood.</p>
<p class="txt">Old woman: (stands up with old man) You're amazing!</p>
<p class="txt">Old man: I'll say!</p>
<p class="txt">Old woman: You've totally entertained us.</p>
<p class="txt">Old man: On top of which, you helped cut firewood.</p>
<p class="txt">KOH:&emsp;&nbsp;Nothing to it!</p>
<p class="txt">Old woman: You must be tired. Come inside and rest.</p>
<p class="txt">KOH:&emsp;&nbsp;Okay.</p><br>
<p>Evening in the old couple's hut. They are eating around the fireplace.</p>
<p class="txt">Old man: Well? Did you remember anything?</p>
<p class="txt">KOH:&emsp;&nbsp;Uh-uh… I don't know.</p>
<p class="txt">Old man: Where'd you come from? Or at least your name?</p>
<p class="txt">Old woman: Maybe, you…used to live close to the castle?</p>
<p class="txt">KOH:&emsp;&nbsp;(surprised) Castle?</p>
<p>Cut scene of the Hitomi castle disintegrating against a purple sky.</p>
<p class="txt">Old woman: (voice-over) About ten days ago, Lord Hitomi's castle suddenly disappeared into thin air.</p>
<p>Cut to KOH lying face down, unconscious, on a forest ground.</p>
<p class="txt">Old woman: (voice-over) And we found you unconscious the next day. Maybe something terribly frightening happened to you…</p>
<p>Cut to present, close up of KOH's face.</p>
<p class="txt">Old woman: …and you lost your memory.</p>
<p>Cut to the three of them.</p>
<p class="txt">Old man: Well, never mind. No need to rush.</p>
<p class="txt">Old woman: yes, yes. Just stay as long as you like, until you remember. Look, there's lot more. Eat up.</p>
<p class="txt">KOH:&emsp;&nbsp;(smiles) Thank you.</p><br>
<p>Night time. KOH sits at the bottom of a tree outside the hut. He looks at the castle ruins a distance away.</p>
<p class="txt">KOH:&emsp;&nbsp;(thinking) Castle… Yes, the castle. I have a feeling I was there.</p>
<p>A horde of NAR's poison insects appears and flies towards KOH.</p>
<p class="txt">KOH:&emsp;&nbsp;(stands up, shocked) Huh?</p>
<p>Cut to KOH running back to the hut.</p>
<p class="txt">KOH:&emsp;&nbsp;(entering) Gramps! Granny!</p>
<p class="txt">Old man: Huh?</p>
<p class="txt">KOH:&emsp;&nbsp;I have to go!</p>
<p class="txt">Old woman: Go where?</p>
<p class="txt">KOH:&emsp;&nbsp;I can't stay here! It's dangerous, so don't go out! (pauses and smiles slightly) Thanks for everything! (walks out)</p>
<p class="txt">Old man: Hey!</p>
<p class="txt">Old woman: Hey you!</p><br>
<p>Cut to KOH sprinting.</p>
<p class="txt">KOH:&emsp;&nbsp;(thinking) That's it! I remember! I ran away from the castle! That night…when the castle disappeared…</p>
<p>Fade to NAR in the guise of Hitomi against a red background.</p>
<p class="txt">NAR:&emsp;&ensp;Kohaku, keeping you alive is no longer necessary. You can join your father and the others.</p>
<p>Back to present.</p>
<p class="txt">KOH:&emsp;&nbsp;(thinking) Kohaku? My name is Kohaku? (notices something and gasps)</p>
<p>The ground in front of KOH suddenly breaks apart and zooms towards KOH. KOH is thrown back by the impact. He jumps backwards and lands, clutching onto his left arm in pain. A praying mantis mutant demon with a skull head and green air appears and looms over KOH threateningly.</p><br>
<p>INU-gang gather around a campfire. A sleeping KIR suddenly wakes and growls.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;What's the matter, Kirara? Demons nearby?</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;I sense a Sacred Jewel fragment!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; What?!</p><br>
<p>Cut to INU-gang running in the forest. MIR and SAN are on KIR's back, SHI and KAG are on INU's back.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Kagome, this way?!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;It's near! Beyond this forest!</p>
<p>NAR's poison insects appear above them.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Naraku's poison insects!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Keh! So are they after the Sacred Jewel fragment, too?!</p><br>
<p>Back to KOH and the mantis mutant.</p>
<p class="txt">Mantis mutant: Kohaku, you can't get away!</p>
<p class="txt">KOH:&emsp;&nbsp;Huh!</p>
<p class="txt">Mantis mutant: Now, obey and return the Sacred Jewel fragments in your back.</p>
<p class="txt">KOH:&emsp;&nbsp;(thinking) Sacred Jewel fragment? (the fragment in his back glows)</p>
<p class="txt">Mantis mutant: (opens wide his mouth and zooms towards KOH) Hand over the fragment!</p>
<p>The mantis mutant attacks KOH with his claws but KOH dodges.</p>
<p class="txt">Mantis mutant: (sticks out a long tongue and whips it at KOH) Die!</p>
<p>KOH yells as he falls to the ground. The sickle chain falls out of his hand. The mantis demon moves swiftly towards him. KOH turns around and yells in terror. Cut to INU-gang arriving at the scene.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Kohaku!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;That demon is trying to get the fragment in Kohaku's back!</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;What?! (thinking) The Sacred Jewel fragment in Kohaku's back is his lifeline. If the fragment is removed, he'll die!</p>
<p>SAN leaps off KIR's back and throws HIR at the mantis mutant. It slices off his head. Pieces of the mutant demon fall to the ground as KOH watches in shock. HIR returns to SAN.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;(thinking) Kohaku!</p>
<p>Flashback of episode 30, when SAN stole INU's TET and brought it to NAR's castle.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;(voice-over) You were under Naraku's mind control and you were in Naraku's castle.</p>
<p>Back to present.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;(thinking) So why are you…?</p>
<p class="txt">KOH:&emsp;&nbsp;(looks puzzled at SAN) You…know me?</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Huh?</p>
<p>SAN gasps.</p><br>
<p>In a hut. SAN tends to the wound on KOH's arm. SHI and KAG sit next to them.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;You've hurt your arm. Let me see.</p>
<p class="txt">KOH:&emsp;&nbsp;Erm…</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Hmm?</p>
<p class="txt">KOH:&emsp;&nbsp;Have we met before?</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;(nods slightly) Uh-huh.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Kohaku… You really don't remember anything about before you escaped from the castle?</p>
<p class="txt">KOH:&emsp;&nbsp;No… I'm sorry.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Even about Naraku?</p>
<p class="txt">KOH:&emsp;&nbsp;(thinking) Naraku?</p>
<p>Flashback of NAR in Hitomi guise against a red background.</p>
<p class="txt">NAR:&emsp;&ensp;Kohaku… Keeping you alive is no longer necessary. Join your father and the others.</p>
<p>Back to present.</p>
<p class="txt">KOH:&emsp;&nbsp;(thinking) Could that have been…Naraku?</p><br>
<p>Outside the hut, MIR and INU are talking.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (plops himself down and folds his arms) I don't like it! That kid is just putting on an act.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; It doesn't look it.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; You trust him?</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; No! But the Kohaku who appeared before us that time was like a puppet…a human without a soul. But now…</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Huh?</p>
<p>MIR and INU turn back. KAG walks towards them. SHI is on her shoulder.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; (looking towards the hut) Is it safe to leave them alone?</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Sango wanted it that way.</p>
<p>MIR and INU look on in silence.</p><br>
<p>Inside the hut. SAN and KOH sit and lean on a wall. Cute KIR looks at KOH.</p>
<p class="txt">KOH:&emsp;&nbsp;The slayers' village?</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Yes…that's where we used to live.</p>
<p>KIR leaps onto KOH's shoulder.</p>
<p class="txt">KOH:&emsp;&nbsp;Then was I also a demon slayer?</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;You were an apprentice.</p>
<p>Fade to flashback of episode 24, in the slayers' village.</p>
<p class="txt">Father: Rest a bit. We have lots of work ahead.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;All right.</p>
<p class="txt">Father: Kohaku, be prepared, too.</p>
<p class="txt">KOH:&emsp;&nbsp;Huh? Me?</p>
<p class="txt">Father: You are already eleven years old. It's time you got some real experience.</p>
<p class="txt">KOH:&emsp;&nbsp;Uh-huh…­</p>
<p>Cut to the porch. KOH practices his sickle-chain, while SAN lies on her stomach and plays with KIR.</p>
<p class="txt">KOH:&emsp;&nbsp;Sister…</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Huh?</p>
<p class="txt">KOH:&emsp;&nbsp;Do demons really spit out fire and poison?</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Sometimes.</p>
<p class="txt">KOH:&emsp;&nbsp;I see…</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;(crawls next to KOH) Kohaku, are you afraid?</p>
<p class="txt">KOH:&emsp;&nbsp;N-no such thing! But… (turns around and sighs)</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;(pats KOH's back) Don't worry! We only slay oversized snakes and spiders. Father always says the demons to fear most are the ones pretending to be humans. If such demons get a hold of the Jewel, it'll be terrible.</p>
<p class="txt">KOH:&emsp;&nbsp;Hmm…</p>
<p>Back to present.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;(thinking) And then that day when we were summoned by Naraku, that was Kohaku's very first battle experience.</p>
<p class="txt">KOH:&emsp;&nbsp;Say… Tell me everything you know.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Huh?</p>
<p class="txt">KOH:&emsp;&nbsp;(holds KIR) I feel so empty… I don't know why I'm like this.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;(thinking) He's just like the Kohaku of old. Quiet…and a bit cowardly. (places her arm around KOH's shoulder)</p>
<p class="txt">KOH:&emsp;&nbsp;Huh?</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Just try to remember little by little. We'll be together from now on.</p>
<p class="txt">KOH:&emsp;&nbsp;(blushing) Huh…? Ah…</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Hmm?</p>
<p class="txt">KOH:&emsp;&nbsp;This is embarrassing…</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;What're you so shy for? We're siblings. (thinking) Kohaku has come back to me. He's escaped from Naraku's grasp… That's what I want to believe.</p>
<p>KOH has fallen asleep in SAN's arms. She smiles.</p><br>
<p>Outside, the rest of the gang seats in a circle.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Give ‘im a couple of knocks and he'll show his real self!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(chiding) Inuyasha, you…!</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; It's not that simple. Whether it's a trap or not, her dear brother is back.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Yes…if this is a trap, Sango will be so hurt.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Naraku loves to play with people's feelings.</p>
<p>SAN walks out of the hut with KIR and closes the door gently. INU stands up and walks towards SAN.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Inuyasha?</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; If you won't tell her, I will!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;W-wait! Stop, Inuyasha!</p>
<p>Cut to SAN walking, deep in thoughts. She stops suddenly and notices INU standing in front of her, with folded arms.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;What's the matter?</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Say… About Kohaku… This has to be Naraku's trap!</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;I believe in Kohaku!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; That's Naraku's aim.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;What else can I do except to trust him?!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; It's a trick Naraku is likely to use!</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;(agitated) If we hadn't come to his aid, his Sacred Jewel fragment would have been removed and he would really have died!</p>
<p>Cut to interior of hut. KOH is awake and listens to the conversation outside.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (background) Listen…that's the trap!</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;(background) It's not a trap!</p>
<p class="txt">KOH:&emsp;&nbsp;(thinking) I feel as though that kind woman will become unhappy…all because of me. I must not stay here. (picks up his sickle-chain)</p>
<p>Outside.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; You're being blinded by love for your kid brother!</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Shut up! What would you know?!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Open your eyes!</p>
<p>KOH walks out of the hut by the back. He peeps at SAN.</p>
<p class="txt">KOH:&emsp;&nbsp;(softly) Farewell… (walks off)</p>
<p>Back to SAN and INU quarreling.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Inuyasha, you…!</p>
<p>A rumbling noise is heard in the background.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Shh! (turns around)</p>
<p>SAN gasps. The noise gets louder.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; (stands) They're coming…</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; A huge number of them!</p>
<p>The sky darkens. A horde of demons appear among the clouds and flies towards them. A horde of NAR's poison insects also appears and flies towards them.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Naraku's poison insects!</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; His advance guard.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;They're…not after Kohaku?!</p>
<p>SAN and KIR run back to the hut.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Sango, you…! (leaps and claws at the insects)</p><br>
<p>Cut to SAN entering the hut.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Kohaku! (looks around the empty hut) Kohaku!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(reaches SAN) Sango, I sense the Sacred Jewel fragment moving. (picks up her bow and arrow) Let's go, Sango! We must protect Kohaku!</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;(nods) Uh-huh!</p><br>
<p>Outside. INU kills a couple of the insects. The horde continues to fly towards them. Suddenly, blades of wind flies towards them. The group dodges. The smoke clears and KAR appears. She lands and laughs.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Kagura! Whaddya want?!</p>
<p class="txt">KAR:&emsp;&nbsp; You're hiding Kohaku, aren't you? Let me have him.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; What?!</p>
<p class="txt">KAR:&emsp;&nbsp; Don't act innocent! The kid Naraku's kept. Kohaku ran off amidst the confusion with the Sacred Jewel fragment in his back.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; And that's why you've come for him?</p>
<p>The demons land around KAR.</p>
<p class="txt">KAR:&emsp;&nbsp; Naraku always goes overboard. Just because he wants the fragment, he sends out this army.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; So you're after the Sacred Jewel fragment?</p>
<p class="txt">KAR:&emsp;&nbsp; Yes…although once that's removed, Kohaku will die. We're under orders to let Sango have him after that.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; W-why you…!</p><br>
<p>Cut to KOH running away from NAR's poison insects in a forest. He stops suddenly as more insects appear in front of him. The two groups of insects fly towards KOH. HIR appears and kills the circle of insects in its wake. SAN grabs it and lands. She heaves a sigh of relief. KAG and KIR land behind SAN.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;You're okay!</p>
<p class="txt">KOH:&emsp;&nbsp;(softly) Why? (shouts at SAN) Why did you come?! They're after me! (SAN stands) Huh?</p>
<p>SAN walks to KOH. He takes a step backwards.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Kohaku. Don't go anywhere anymore.</p>
<p class="txt">KOH:&emsp;&nbsp;Why? Why go through all this for me?</p>
<p>SAN walks next to KOH, and looks into the distance. KOH gasps.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;(slowly) You're my…brother. You're my one and only little brother.</p>
<p>KOH is speechless. KIR suddenly growls and looks at the sky.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Kirara!</p>
<p>A horde of demons fly toward them.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Kagome, watch Kohaku. I'll stop those demons!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;All right!</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;(runs forward) Kirara!</p>
<p>KIR catches up with SAN and carries SAN on her back. They leap towards the demons.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;(shouting) Kohaku! You must live!</p>
<p>KOH looks at SAN. KAG runs to him and holds his hand.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Let's go!</p>
<p class="txt">KOH:&emsp;&nbsp;Uh…!</p><br>
<p>Cut to KOH and KAG running through the forest. They stop suddenly as a demon fly at them. KAG draws an arrow and kills the demon. More demons appear.</p>
<p class="txt">KOH:&emsp;&nbsp;If this keeps up…</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Don't worry!</p>
<p>KAG shoots more arrows at the demons and miraculously, doesn't miss a shot. All the demons are killed. She reaches for another arrow and gasps.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;I'm out of arrows! (looks towards a hole under a tree) We'll hide in that hole.</p><br>
<p>Inside the hole. Two of NAR's poison insects fly by outside without noticing KOH and KAG.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;We'll wait until Inuyasha comes.</p>
<p class="txt">KOH:&emsp;&nbsp;That woman…</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Huh?</p>
<p class="txt">KOH:&emsp;&nbsp;I wonder if she's all right.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Oh…Sango is really strong. Don't worry about her.</p>
<p>KOH is deep in thoughts.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Kohaku… You still don't remember? That Sango is your older sister?</p>
<p class="txt">KOH:&emsp;&nbsp;No… But she… She seems so familiar.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Sango had always worried about you while you two were apart. She's always so cheerful but once in a while, she looks very sad. So I'm glad that you've returned.</p>
<p class="txt">KOH:&emsp;&nbsp;Is it… Is it okay to stay with her?</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Of course! Then you'll start to remember about Sango.</p>
<p class="txt">KOH:&emsp;&nbsp;Uh-huh… (thinking) I want to remember…about her and everything else. But…what's this feeling? I feel scared…something I don't want to remember…</p>
<p>Cut to NAR in baboon suit against a red background.</p>
<p class="txt">NAR:&emsp;&ensp;Kill her… Kill Kagome.</p>
<p>Cut to present. The Sacred Jewel fragment glows in KOH's back and he gasps in pain. Cut to KAG peeping out of the hole.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(worried) Inuyasha… He's so late.</p>
<p>Cut to KOH raising his sickle-chain.</p>
