Rumour has it that there's a village of demon slayers nearby. And that perhaps we could find some clues about the Sacred Jewel there. But we aren't the only ones with similar thinking! Demons kept appearing and attacked this village! And a pair of siblings who fell into a trap! Are all these Naraku's doing again? Next episode, 'The Demon Exterminator, Sango Appears!'</p>
<p class="header"><a name="1"></a>'Adult Swim' Synopsis</p>
<p>Inuyasha, Miroku and Shippo are sitting around a fire discussing the Shikon Jewel. Miroku explains that if Inuyasha uses the jewel to become a full-blooded demon, he will probably slay his companions. Meanwhile, in a nearby village, a young girl named Sango prepares her brother Kohaku for his first demon-slaying.</p>

                  Kirara may belong to a type of demoms called <i>nekomata</i>. 
                  The <i>nekomata</i> is a cat with either a tail split halfway 
                  or a tail splitting all the way to form two tails. It is believed 
                  that the <i>nekomata</i> can animate and control the dead by 
                  gesturing its tail. It was also once believed that cats become 
                  <i>nekomatas</i> after ten years of age. For more info, refer

<p>Daytime. Bird's eye view of forest. The trees shake violently. Cut to village.</p>
<p class="txt">Villager 1: It comes! From the forest! Slayer! Please!</p>
<p>A young woman in battle gear and a giant boomerang appears and walks towards the forest. She's wearing a mask. A giant centipede rushes out of the forest and towards her. She swings her boomerang and swiftly cuts the centipede into two. The boomerang returns to her. The centipede crashes to the ground and a Sacred Jewel fragment falls out. She catches it.</p>
<p class="txt">Slayer: A Sacred Jewel fragment, after all.</p>
<p class="txt">Villager 2: Slayer, what's that?</p>
<p class="txt">Slayer: The cause of the centipede going berserk.</p>
<p>Cut to the slayer changing her clothes. She steps out of the changing room and bows to the villagers.</p>
<p class="txt">Slayer: Please call me if you need me.</p>
<p class="txt">Villager 2: What about your fee?</p>
<p class="txt">Slayer: That's okay…I'll take this instead. Besides, the Sacred Jewel originally came from my province.</p>

<p>Nighttime. INU-gang camps out. MIR, SHI and INU sit around a campfire, while KAG is lying in her sleeping bag.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; So many stars. I wonder which is more, the number of stars or the number of Jewel fragments? (looks down) The road ahead is long.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Not really.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; Why?!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; That Naraku has the same goal and is gathering the fragments. Simply put, he's saving us work. Make him gather lots and lots and then take them all from him. (pleased) Hah! How's that for strategy?!</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; Inuyasha… The more Sacred Jewel fragments he gathers, the stronger Naraku becomes! (INU frowns) Then it'll be too late! We must hurry and gather lots ourselves. (sighs) Cripes! Even a kid like me knows that! (shakes head) You were really born without a brain!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (clenches his fist) What?! Say that again!</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Inuyasha, what will you do when you gather all the fragments?</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Isn't it obvious? I'm gonna become a full-fledged demon!</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Ohh… Is that all?</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Can't do a thing when you're weak. If there's a guy you don't care for, what's the sense if you lose to him?</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; However, Inuyasha… When you become a true demon with the Sacred Jewel, will you be able to remain as you are?</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; W-what do you mean?</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Have you ever seen anyone using the Sacred Jewel fragments to do good deeds? (looks into the fire) This is what I believe… Those who seek the Sacred Jewel, lose their hearts in the process.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Keh! I don't remember ever saying that I want to become a good demon.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; However…you want to protect Kagome. And that's why you want power. But when you use the Jewel's power to become a demon, you may just end up devouring Shippo and Kagome.</p>
<p>KAG gasps.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; (clutching to MIR) Me, too?! What about you, Miroku?</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; I would have run away long before that.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (thinking, serious) Stupid! All the demons I fought until now were bad from the start. That's all it is! But I'm different!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(looks at the fragments in her hands, thinking) Inuyasha…</p><br>
<p>Daytime in a village. INU waylays several villagers and interrogates them.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; What?! A woman had a Jewel fragment?! When was this? When?! Answer me!</p>
<p class="txt">Villager 1: Another demon!</p>
<p class="txt">Villager 2: We must hire the Slayer!</p>
<p class="txt">Villager 3: A giant centipede!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Me?! A centipede?!</p>
<p>A while later. INU-gang and the villagers have a decent conversation.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; A Demon Slayer?</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Hmm… Someone actually makes a living slaying demons?</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; And this Slayer gathers the Sacred Jewel fragments?</p>
<p class="txt">Villager 3: Uh-huh… She says that this Sacred Whatever originally appears in her province.</p>
<p class="txt">Villager 2: Yeah…</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Did you know this, Inuyasha?</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Err… No.</p>
<p>Cut to image of KIK holding the Sacred Jewel in her hand.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (voice-over) When I first came across the Sacred Jewel, it was already in Kikyo's possession. I never even thought about how the Jewel was made or where it came from.</p><br>
<p>In another village high up in the mountains. The wooden gates open and the slayer from earlier on enters.</p>
<p class="txt">Woman 1: Welcome back, Sango.</p>
<p class="ttable">Sango abbreviated as SAN from now onwards.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Hello!</p>
<p>SAN unwraps her bundle to reveal centipede parts. The villagers gather around her.</p>
<p class="txt">Villager 1: What was your prey?</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;A giant centipede. It's not much, but I brought back the legs and skin. You can use it for an armor.</p>
<p>A two tailed cat runs into SAN's arms and meows.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Good girl, Kirara. Have you been good?</p>
<p class="ttable">Kirara abbreviated as KIR from now onwards.</p>
<p>KIR rubs her face on SAN's cheek and meows.</p>
<p class="txt">Boy:&emsp;&ensp; Welcome home, Sister! (runs to SAN)</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Hi, Kohaku.</p>
<p class="ttable">Kohaku abbreviated as KOH from now onwards.</p>
<p class="txt">KOH:&emsp;&nbsp;Father… I mean the Chief wants to see you.</p><br>
<p>In a big hut. SAN, KOH and their father stand in front of an altar. A fragment lie in a container on it.</p>
<p class="txt">Chief:&emsp;I see… So you found a fragment of the Sacred Jewel. Good work, Sango. Let's see… (prays)</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Father, will that be enough to suppress the evil within the Jewel?</p>
<p class="txt">Chief:&emsp;Probably not.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;I doubt it.</p>
<p class="txt">Chief:&emsp;About fifty years ago, it was supposedly turned over to priestess with unusual powers for purification. But even that priestess became embroiled in a fight over the Jewel and died. All we can do is…until someone is found who has the power to purify the Jewel, we must gather the fragments and keep watch over them.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;(thinking) The power to purify the Jewel…? (looks at the altar)</p><br>
<p>Outside. SAN is exercising her shoulders. The chief and KOH walk out.</p>
<p class="txt">Chief:&emsp;Rest a bit. We'll be needing you very shortly.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Okay. (walks off)</p>
<p class="txt">Chief:&emsp;Kohaku, make ready too.</p>
<p class="txt">KOH:&emsp;&nbsp;Huh? Me?</p>
<p class="txt">Chief:&emsp;You are already eleven. It's time you got some real battle experience.</p>
<p>KOH seems uncomfortable.</p><br>
<p>In KOH and SAN's house. They sit in the pavilion. Three bowls are placed on wooden stumps. SAN is playing with KIR.</p>
<p class="txt">KOH:&emsp; Sister…</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Hmm?</p>
<p>KOH swings his sickle chain at the bowls and crushes all of them.</p>
<p class="txt">KOH:&emsp; (takes the sickle-chain) Do demons really spit out toxins and fire?</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Sometimes.</p>
<p class="txt">KOH:&emsp;&nbsp;(looks down) I see…</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;(crawls next to KOH) Kohaku… Are you afraid?</p>
<p class="txt">KOH:&emsp;&nbsp;N-no… (sighs)</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;(pats KOH on the shoulder) Don't worry! We slay large serpents and spiders. Father always says the demons to fear most are the ones pretending to be humans. And if such demons get a hold of the Jewel, terrible things would happen.</p>
<p>KOH nods.</p><br>
<p>Nighttime in a castle. The lord is seated at the entrance, while guards surround him. SAN, KOH, their father and two other slayers kneel in front of the lord.</p>
<p class="txt">Lord:&ensp;&nbsp; Welcome, Slayers. Nightly, a giant spider terrorizes this castle and has eaten several of our people. Will you be able to destroy it?</p>
<p class="txt">Chief:&emsp;Leave it to me. I have chosen the most skilled ones to assist.</p>
<p class="txt">Lord:&ensp;&nbsp; Oh? Most skilled perhaps… (looks at SAN) but a young woman… (looks at KOH) and you even brought a child?</p>
<p class="txt">Chief:&emsp;These two are my daughter and son. In the province, they are the top two fighters. You can witness their skills tonight.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Heard that? Do your best, Kohaku.</p>
<p class="txt">KOH:&emsp;&nbsp;(trembling) F-father…you liar.</p>
<p>The sky turns overcast and thunder rolls.</p>
<p class="txt">Subject 1: It's coming! My lord!</p>
<p class="txt">Subject 2: Slayer! There it is!</p>
<p class="txt">Chief:&emsp;Yes! Let's go!</p>
<p>A giant spider appears out of the clouds and lands in front of the slayers. It growls.</p><br>
<p>Inside the mansion. An old man kneels in front of a room and speaks to a young man inside through the blinds.</p>
<p class="txt">Man:&emsp;&ensp;The demon is here again?</p>
<p class="txt">Old Man: That demon is also the cause of your long illness. But Slayers have been summoned. We should see the last of that beast tonight. (kowtows) Then you must hurry and get well.</p>
<p class="txt">Man:&emsp;&ensp;Slayers?</p><br>
<p>The slayers are fighting the spider demon. They run towards it while it's spewing a web of strands at them.</p>
<p class="txt">Chief:&emsp;Surround it!</p>
<p>SAN moves through the strands easily. KOH's ankle is caught by a bundle of strands and he is lifted into the air.</p>
<p class="txt">Slayer 1: (cuts the strands with his axe) Kohaku!</p>
<p>KOH is released from the strands and lands.</p>
<p class="txt">Slayer 1: (pats KOH's shoulder) Take a deep breath and go, Kohaku!</p>
<p>KOH nods.</p>
<p class="txt">Slayer 2: Come on!</p>
<p>He attacks the demon with a huge Morningstar, and flesh is pried out. The demon collapses and Chief holds its neck down with his pike.</p>
<p class="txt">Chief:&emsp;(to SAN) All right! Got it!</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Hiraikotsu!</p>
<p class="ttable"> Hiraikotsu the boomerang abbreviated as HIR from now onwards.</p>
<p>SAN swings HIR, her boomerang, at the demon, which sweeps from its head to its back, prying the flesh out. The heavy HIR returns and SAN catches it. The demon growls in pain, struggles and collapses.</p>
<p class="txt">KOH:&emsp;&nbsp;Awesome, Sister!</p>
<p class="txt">Slayer 1: Sango is the best in the province.</p>
<p class="txt">Subject 1: Wow!</p>
<p class="txt">Subject 2: She slain the giant spider in one sweep!</p>
<p class="txt">Slayer 1: Let's finish this up!</p>
<p class="txt">Slayer 2: Crash its head! (raise his Morningstar)</p>
<p class="txt">KOH:&emsp;&nbsp;Okay, me too…!</p>
<p>KOH runs over to help. A white string appears and moves to his neck. KOH slows down.</p>
<p class="txt">Slayer 1: It may've been huge, but it was such easy prey.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;(thinking) It was too easy… This spider…I don't like it…</p>
<p>Suddenly the slayers and the chief were slain by KOH's sickle-chain. SAN is shocked and turns around. KOH's sickle-chain returns to him.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Why…? Kohaku…why did you slay Father and…?!</p>
<p>KOH doesn't reply and sprints towards SAN with cold eyes.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;(backing off) Stop, Kohaku!</p>
<p>KOH throws his sickle at SAN, who dodges. It cuts off her mask instead.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;(falls to her knees) Don't you recognize me?!</p>
<p class="txt">Subject 1: Hey! Slayer?!</p>
<p class="txt">Subject 2: What happened?!</p>
<p class="txt">Lord:&ensp;&nbsp; Let them be… This is very entertaining.</p>
<p>KOH throws his sickle at SAN again, who blocks it with her sword. KOH then takes out his sword, sprints towards SAN and attacks.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;(blocks with her sword) What happened, Kohaku?! (gasps as she notices the string in KOH's neck, thinking) The thread…of the spider…</p>
<p>The string leads to the lord, who chuckles and two fangs are seen in his mouth.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Why you…! (kicks KOH away, picks up HIR and shouts to the lord) Is this your doing?! I'll kill you!</p>
<p class="txt">Lord:&ensp;&nbsp; These siblings have both gone mad! Kill them!</p>
<p class="txt">Subjects: Yes! (runs to SAN)</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Damn! (knocks the subjects away with HIR and runs towards the lord)</p>
<p>Suddenly KOH's sickle chain pierces SAN's back. She yells in pain and turns around slowly to KOH. KOH trembles in fear and falls to his knees. His eyes are back to normal. He throws away his chain and looks at his hands.</p>
<p class="txt">KOH:&emsp;&nbsp;(takes off his mask and looks at SAN, tearing) S-sister…!</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Kohaku…</p>
<p class="txt">KOH:&emsp;&nbsp;I… (runs to SAN with outreached hand) Sister!</p>
<p>Four arrows suddenly appear and pierces through KOH. He falls backwards.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;(in shock) Kohaku!</p>
<p class="txt">Lord:&ensp;&nbsp; Cast your arrows at these crazed two!</p>
<p>The subjects raise their bows. SAN crawls over to KOH who is crying.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;K-kohaku!</p>
<p class="txt">KOH:&emsp;&nbsp;S-sister! I'm scared…</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;(hugs KOH) It's all right. I'm with…</p>
<p>Three arrows hit SAN's back. She gasps and falls over.</p>
<p class="txt">Lord:&ensp;&nbsp; The siblings have made up. So nice, so nice…</p>
<p>The lord is suddenly slain and falls over. The young lord appears behind him with a sword in his hand. The subjects gasp in terror.</p>
<p class="txt">Subjects: Lord!</p>
<p class="txt">Subject 3: Young lord, what have you done?!</p>
<p class="txt">Young Lord: He is not Father. Take a good look.</p>
<p>Out of the shadow of the fallen lord appears spider legs.</p>
<p class="txt">Subject 1: T-this is…</p>
<p class="txt">Subject 2: A demon!</p>
<p>The shadow of the spider tries to escape but the young lord strikes it with his sword.</p>
<p class="txt">Young Lord: I had been thinking that Father was acting differently. He had been possessed by the demon. It's too bad about those Slayers. Bury them in a corner of the garden.</p>
<p class="txt">Subjects: Yes, sire!</p>
<p>Cut to SAN and KOH fallen on the ground.</p><br>
<p>Nighttime. INU-gang travel in a dark forest.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; This is not good…no one knows where the Village of the Demon Slayers is.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;All they can say is it's in the mountain…</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Shaddup! Just find them!</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; (on INU's shoulder) Inuyasha… You intend to steal the Jewel fragments from them?</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Of course!</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Hopefully, we won't be slain first.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;I'll say! Those people are supposed to be pros. (thinking) But I'm curious, too, about how the Sacred Jewel came to be. They claim that the Sacred Jewel first appeared in their province. I'm sure Inuyasha wants to know about this, too.</p>
<p>A gust of wind blows.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; What is it…? This ominous wind…</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Something is approaching… Lots of them.</p>
<p>A horde of demons fly across the sky above them. KAG and SHI gasp.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; A horde of demons!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;What is this awful feeling? This is really weird!</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; (perspiring) She's right… I'm starting to feel worse and worse.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Death is in the air! They're going to attack something! (runs)</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; (to KAG) Let's go after them! (runs)</p><br>
<p>In the castle. The slayers are buried under mounds of soil. Two subjects patrol the area.</p>
<p class="txt">Subject 1: The sibling Slayers… They were still so young.</p>
<p class="txt">Subject 2: Poor things.</p>
<p>A hand suddenly thrusts out of the burial mound. It is SAN.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;(struggling) Damn! (crawls) I…will…NOT…die!</p>
<p>The young lord walks out of the mansion and notices SAN.</p>
<p class="txt">Young Lord: Slayer! You are still alive?</p>
<p>SAN looks at the young lord intently.</p><br>
<p>Cut to a bird's eye view of the village of the demon slayers. Explosions are heard. NAR in his baboon suit overlooks the village and chuckles. He leaps towards the village. Inside the village, slayers are desperately fighting off demons. Many villagers lay dead. The village is burning as the demons savagely destroy everything. Inside a hut, five Sacred Jewel fragments are on the ground. A group of demons stand around it and fighting with each other. NAR enters.</p>
<p class="txt">NAR:&emsp;&ensp;You seem to have avenged your long-harbored grudge. (walks to the fragments) After I told you that the Slayers were not at this fortress…you're going to attack me?</p>
<p>The demons loom over NAR ominously. Cut to image of ONI eaten by demons. Cut to present. The demons are absorbed into NAR's body.</p>
<p class="txt">NAR:&emsp;&ensp;Such fools… (chuckles)</p>
<p class="txtb">[ End of ACT II: 16min 6sec ]</p><br>
<p class="txtb"><a name="_ACT_III_"></a>[ ACT III ]</p>
<p>INU-gang walks along a mountain path. They stop.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; That's…!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;A fortress? The demons were headed…</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Here! (runs)</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Wait!</p>
<p>The group run towards the smoldering village. Cut to the gang entering. They notice the corpses of humans and demons strewn around the place.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;T-this is…!</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; A battlefield of demons?</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; No mistake… This is the village of the Demon Slayers. What's the matter, Kagome?</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;I don't sense the presence of Jewel fragments.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Meaning…we're too late?</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; If we go after them now, we can catch up!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; First, let's bury the dead. Otherwise it'd be too cruel.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; You're right.</p>
<p>Something growls in the background.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;There's something! (hides behind INU)</p>
<p>A huge two tailed tiger-like beast appears, biting a demon head in its mouth. It looks at them, growls fiercely and walks towards them.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (unsheathes TET) A demon survivor…!</p>
<p>The beast growls at INU threateningly.</p>
<p class="txt">Beast:&nbsp; That voice…belongs to Inuyasha.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Huh?</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;It spoke!</p>
<p class="txt">Beast:&nbsp; Back off, Kirara. (the beast tilts its head) These people are not enemies.</p>
<p>The beast drops the demon head and transforms into KIR (SAN's cute two-tailed cat). She looks at them innocently.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; W-wha…!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;How cute!</p>
<p>KIR scratches herself and a flea jumps out.</p>
<p class="txt">MYO:&emsp; Gamyo! Gamyo! (leaps to INU's nose) It has been such a long time. (sucks)</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (slaps MYO) Old Myoga! (opens his palm with MYO inside)</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;What're you doing here?!</p>
<p class="txt">MYO:&emsp; (his flattened body slips off INU's hand) Oh dear…'</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; You know him?</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; He's Inuyasha's vassal…or tries to be.</p><br>
<p>MIR is digging graves with a hoe. INU lays the corpses on mats.</p>
<p class="txt">MYO:&emsp; (on INU's shoulder) Precisely…this is the secret province of the Demon Slayers. For generations, the people of this village have trained and worked to get rid of demons.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Well then, they must've been hated by the demons.</p>
<p class="txt">MYO:&emsp; However, to be attacked now of all times. A number of the warriors had been summoned to a castle and this village was left with few to protect it. I have this bad feeling. I wonder if those who went to the castle are safe?</p><br>
<p>Daytime in the castle. SAN's lays on a straw mat in a room. The young lord and two servants sit around her.</p>
<p class="txt">Young Lord: I'm glad…at least you are alive.</p>
<p class="txt">Old Man: You there, Slayer! Answer the young lord!</p>
<p class="txt">Young Lord: Old one, that's enough.</p>
<p class="txt">Old Man: B-but…</p>
<p class="txt">Young Lord: Your name is Sango, right? I'm sorry… About your father and brother…and your comrades.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;(thinking) Why? How did this happen?</p>
<p class="txt">NAR:&emsp;&ensp;Young Lord… (appears in a bush outside)</p>
<p class="txt">Young Lord: (walks out) Naraku…</p>
<p class="txt">NAR:&emsp;&ensp;Yes… As you ordered, I rushed to the village to notify them of this terrible development. But the village had been annihilated.</p>
<p>SAN overhears and gasps.</p><br>
<p>In the village. KAG lays chrysanthemum flowers on the graves. KIR looks on.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; How unfortunate… I had so many questions to ask the villagers.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Old Myoga…you must know something at least?</p>
<p class="txt">MYO:&emsp; Huh? You mean about the Sacred Jewel?</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Myoga, were you perhaps looking into the Sacred Jewel yourself?</p>
<p class="txt">MYO:&emsp; Well… (frowns) I had been bothered for some time about just what this Sacred Jewel was. After all, anyone who had been involved with the Sacred Jewel had come upon some misfortune. I followed rumors about the Sacred Jewel and found myself here in this village. However, one thing worried me. During my journey, a white baboon slipping in and out of sight.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; A white baboon?! (thinking) It's Naraku! He must be near!</p><br>
<p>Cut to castle. The young lord is seated outside SAN's room, speaking to NAR.</p>
<p class="txt">Young Lord: Tell me in detail what you saw at the Slayer's Village.</p>
<p class="txt">NAR:&emsp;&ensp;The slain bodies of countless villagers and the half-demon who attacked them… His name is Inuyasha. Inuyasha seeks the power of the Sacred Jewel to turn himself into a full-fledged demon.</p>
<p class="txt">Young Lord: Sacred Jewel?</p>
<p class="txt">NAR:&emsp;&ensp;He must have believed that he would find the Jewel at the village and thus attacked it.</p>
<p>SAN pops out of the room angrily.</p>
<p class="txt">Young Lord: Sango!</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;(angry) Give me my weapon! I will get the one who attacked my village… I will kill this half-demon Inuyasha!</p>

<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;When Sango heard that Inuyasha killed everyone in her village, she resolved to use her last breath to kill him. But her body is too weak to be battling again, and yet she uses all her strength to maneuver the big weapon, Hiraikotsu! There’s a Sacred Jewel fragment in her back! All these are Naraku’s doing again! So Inuyasha attacks the transformed Naraku with Tetsusaiga yet again!
