Naraku has a new body and uses a more despicable method to enter the deepest fears in our hearts; like Inuyasha who is guilty for Kikyo's death, Miroku who is plagued by his Wind Tunnel, and Sango who misses Kohaku. Kikyo, are you willing to help us? But you snatched our Sacred Jewel fragments! What's your motive?! Next episode, 'Kikyo, Captured by Naraku'!</p>
<p class="header"><a name="1"></a>'Adult Swim' Synopsis</p>
<p>Naraku brings Kikyo to his castle, and our heroes pursue him. Unfortunately, on the way, they fall under Naraku’s Spell of Illusory Death, which causes frightening hallucinations. Only Kagome is immune, but Inuyasha manages to break free. Meanwhile, Kikyo appears before Kagome to reveal Naraku’s surprising secret.</p>

<p class="ttextb">Oddities</p>
<ul><li> Kikyo only took Kagome’s necklace of part of the Sacred Jewel, which was calcified by Spider Head in episode 13. By right, after that episode, they had five more fragments, three of which from Miroku. So it is queer that they say in episode 34 that they would start from scratch. </li></ul></td><td class="capt"><img style="width: 180px; height: 135px;" alt="" src="pics/waterfall2o3.jpg" vspace="5"><br>Waterfall scene recycled from ep3.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><p><b>Comments</b></p>
<ul><li>I think the idea of an attack, Illusionary Death, using personal hell part of the brilliance of TAKAHASHI Rumiko. Fear that dwells in the inner self, brought into an external scenario, which in a sense, makes you fight yourself, yourself being your greatest enemy.</li>
<li><i>“My physical self died on that day. But with this borrowed body, I feel more comfortable. I do not expect you to understand.”<br>&ndash; Kikyo</i><br>It is another brilliance of Takahashi to have Kikyo say this to Naraku, both of which are borrowing bodies. Kikyo’s body has to be replenished by souls, while Naraku’s has to be replenished with demons. Yet Kikyo is comfortable with her borrowed body which retains part of her former self, the guardian priestess of the Sacred Jewel. Naraku, on the other hand, tries to get away from his former self totally and erase traces of Onigumo.</li>
<li>Naraku is a hanyou, as said by Kikyo near the end of the episode. Imagine what would happen if he managed to steal Inuyasha's Tetsusaiga in episode 30… He would be a formidable foe, even though he has no need for the Wind Scar which would slays a hundred demons; he has the power to suck in a hundred demons…</li></ul></td></tr>

<p class="txt">NAR:&emsp;&ensp;(walking in) I have put up a barrier. Those insects cannot get through. (KIK opens her eyes) Without the souls of the dead, you cannot move. (sits beside KIK) Kikyo…Just what are you thinking?</p>
<p>Flashback of previous episode, demon carcasses swirling in a purple pool. Two huge demons fight.</p>
<p class="txt">NAR:&emsp;&ensp;(narrating) In the mountain where the Fuko spell was cast, many demons were sealed inside in order to create my new body. Lured by the miasma around the mountain, Inuyasha stumbled onto the scene and began fighting with the demon being forged into Kodoku. (INU fighting a demon) Then you appeared. Your arrows have the power to easily break the seal of the spell. (KIK’s arrow deflects INU’s finishing blow on the demon, and flies upwards breaking the Fuko spell) At that time, if you had wanted to protect Inuyasha from being fused with the demon, you should have shot the demon with your arrow. The demon would have disintegrated and the Fuko spell would have been broken. (the demons merges with NAR’s body) Were you trying to see what waited beyond the creation of the Kodoku?</p>
<p class="txt">KIK:&emsp;&ensp; And there you were.</p>
<p>Back to present.</p>
<p class="txt">KIK:&emsp;&ensp; That is a fine disguise, Onigumo.</p>
<p class="txt">NAR:&emsp;&ensp;Onigumo, huh? How nostalgic. Fifty years ago, you saved a wounded fugitive and sheltered him in a cave. Onigumo offered his body to the demons, latched onto his evil soul and thus was born me – Naraku. (takes out a Sacred Jewel piece)</p>
<p class="txt">KIK:&emsp;&ensp; That’s…!</p>
<p class="txt">NAR:&emsp;&ensp;Exactly. The very thing you gave your life in trying to erase from the world, a fragment of the Sacred Jewel.</p>
<p class="txt">KIK:&emsp;&ensp; I have heard that you killed me in your desire to possess the Sacred Jewel.</p>
<p class="txt">NAR:&emsp;&ensp;It’s laughable I’m telling it all to you, a mere collection of the souls of the dead. But the fragments are gathering within my grasp.</p>
<p>NAR opens a window and lets in a soul-carrier. His eyes glow and emits a light which shatters the soul-carrier. NAR imbues the Sacred Jewel piece into the soul-orb that it was carrying. The soul-orb glows red.</p>
<p class="txt">NAR:&emsp;&ensp;Do you know the girl who resembles you? A battle between those who possess the power to purify evil. If you yearn for this world, defeat her.</p>
<p>The soul-orb enters into KIK.</p>

<p>Outdoors with SAN, MIR, SHI and KIR.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Don’t you think those two have been acting strange?</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Yes…</p>
<p>Cut to INU and KAG by a river.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Inuyasha…Hey!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (lost in thoughts) Huh?</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Let’s go! We must save Kikyo. They can’t have gone far yet.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; I’ll go alone.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; (suddenly appears from behind and steps on INU’s head) Don’t be ridiculous, fool! (kicks him to the ground) Naraku is the one who took Kikyo. Naraku is the evil creature who created this nuisance of a hole in my right hand! I owe him!</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;We are all after Naraku.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; It’s not your problem alone, Inuyasha!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;We’re all worried about you and Kikyo. So stop sneaking around and trying to solve everything alone.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Sneaking around?! When did I ever do that?!</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; (taken aback) Inuyasha! Look!</p>
<p>INU-gang turns to where MIR was looking. KIK soul-carriers fly across the sky.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; They’re Kikyo’s soul collectors!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Kikyo is close by, after all!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Let’s follow them!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Okay!</p>
<p>Cut to INU-gang sprinting across a grass plain. SAN, SHI and KAG ride on transformed KIR.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Kagome…why aren’t you hitching onto Inuyasha’s back like usual?</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Well… (thinking) Inuyasha’s mind is full of Kikyo right now. (blushes, and continues thinking) Besides, why did I always go onto his back when he was not even my boyfriend? Oh dear… I feel so embarrassed! (clasps her face and shrieks) Oh dear…how embarrassing!</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; What’s the matter with Kagome?</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Dunno…</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (thinking) Kikyo died because of Naraku. I will not let Naraku have Kikyo!</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;The number of soul collectors have increased. (hears a slight buzzing sound) They…</p>
<p>SAN leaps off KIR and slashes one of the soul-collectors, revealing a bee inside.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;They’re…! Everyone, it’s a trap! Watch out!</p>
<p>The soul-collectors that INU-gang was chasing emits smoke. As SAN lands, INU-gang finds themselves slowly finds themselves running through a dark forest.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (thinking) What’s that?! (leaps off the ground) That’s…!</p>
<p>INU leaps off into through a smoke and as he lands, he finds himself alone in a burning village.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Where am I?</p>
<p class="txt">Mob: (appearing among the flames) He’s the one who attacked the village! That’s Inuyasha! It’s Inuyasha!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (stunned) Where am I?! (feels something in his palm, and raises it to take a closer look) This is…?! The Sacred Jewel! (A necklace of a whole Sacred Jewel)</p>
<p class="txt">Voice:&ensp; (angry) Inuyasha!</p>
<p>INU turns back to the source of the voice and gets shot by an arrow. He falls backwards, the Sacred Jewel necklace falling out of his hand.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Kikyo…</p>
<p>KIK appears among the flames holding a bow.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (to himself) I know…this is fifty years ago…in this village, on this day, Kikyo killed me. I attacked this village in order to steal the Sacred Jewel. (to KIK) Kikyo, this was a trap! Kikyo! Wait! (KIK draws her bow) Wait, Kikyo! (to himself) No…a dream? What is this?!</p><br>
<p>MIR walking alone in the dark forest.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; (apprehensive) Inuyasha and the others are gone.</p>
<p>A gust of wind starts to blow.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; The wind is picking up. The sound of the wind…From my Wind Tunnel? (raises his right palm and looks at it) I’m being sucked in!</p><br>
<p>SHI riding on transformed KIR through the dark forest.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; All right, Kirara, there’s nothing behind us. Hmm? What’s going on? (KI fades away and SHI falls to the ground) Kirara has disappeared! Huh?! Kagome! Sango!</p>
<p>SHI sees silhouettes of INU-gang walking in front.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; Wait! (the silhouettes fades out)</p>
<p>SHI rushes forward to where they were, only to find piles of clothes.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; Everyone’s clothes…! (picks up KAG’s school uniform) What happened to everyone?! Where did their bodies go?!</p>
<p>Cut to silhouette of SHI running frantically around.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; Inuyasha! Miroku! (trips and falls) Kagome! Sango!</p><br>
<p>SAN running in dark forest in battle gear with HIR. She kneels and look around her. She discovers a big trail of blood on the ground. The sky shifts to a blood red. SAN stands up and takes off her boomerang. She sees something ahead and gasps while walking towards it. It is MIR and INU lying against a tree trunk each, dead from battle wounds. SAN gasps in horror. She turns around. A sickle is raised in the air and slashes her. A silhouette is seen.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;(falling backwards) Kohaku!</p><br>
<p>NAR, in his baboon suit, sits among the branches on a huge tree. KIK lies at his feet. A soul-collector tries to reach them but is stopped by a barrier.</p>
<p class="txt">NAR:&emsp;&ensp;My evil spell of Illusionary Death. Truly, the heart is such a weak thing. Sadness… Fear… Confusion… (cut-scene of SHI entangled among creepers and unconscious) If the negative forces inside their hearts (cut-scene of SAN entangled among creepers and unconscious) are touched by the creepers I’ve placed here,</p>
<p>Cut to KAG walking through the forest alone.</p>
<p class="txt">NAR:&emsp;&ensp;(continues, narrating) their souls will be consumed into the dark.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Where have they all gone? (two creepers on the ground suddenly move towards her) What are these vines?! Oh yuck! (beats the creepers with her bow)</p>
<p class="txt">NAR:&emsp;&ensp;(voice-over) Is it because she has the Sacred Jewel fragments? That girl alone is unaffected by my sorcery.</p>
<p>Cut to NAR and KIK.</p>
<p class="txt">NAR:&emsp;&ensp;(to an unconscious KIK) Only she will succeed in reaching here. I have set the stage for you.</p>
<p class="txt">KIK:&emsp;&ensp; (opens eyes) Such cunning…</p>
<p>KIK slashes NAR’s head off suddenly, revealing a wooden puppet underneath.</p>
<p>Cut to NAR’s room. A wooden puppet breaks into two. NAR, in his Kagewaki guise, sits in the shadows, looking at the puppet.</p>
<p class="txt">NAR:&emsp;&ensp;She destroyed my puppet. How dare she defy me.</p>
<p>Cut to KIK holding the puppet in her hand, which disintegrates with the baboon suit. KAG reaches KIK.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(surprised) Kikyo! (happily runs towards KIK) Kikyo! You’re all right! Kikyo!</p>
<p>Cut to KIK drawing her arrow at KAG, who is nearing her.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Everyone was so worried…</p>
<p>KIK shoots and her arrow grazes KAG’s cheek. KAG is stunned. The arrow melts into white light when it hit the ground behind her, and enlarges into a big hole. It keeps enlarging till it reaches KAG, who falls into it screaming. She manage to grab hold of one creeper and is left dangling, staring into the depths of the hole. KIK walks up to the perimeter of the hole.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Kikyo!</p>
<p class="txt">KIK:&emsp;&ensp; Naraku fears you. So he tried to control me with a Sacred Jewel fragment and force me into fight you.</p>
<p>Three soul-collectors fly towards KAG and circles her.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(thinking) Are they saving me?</p>
<p>The soul-collectors wrap around KAG and lift her above the hole, to be at eye-level with KIK.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;There’s a Sacred Jewel fragment in your chest!</p>
<p class="txt">KIK:&emsp;&ensp; (red light glows from her chest) I am the priestess who held the Sacred Jewel in check… I have not fallen so low as to be controlled by a mere fragment.</p>
<p>KIK touches the red light when turns to pink and disappears. She reaches for KAG’s Sacred Jewel necklace and takes it. KAG is even more stunned. Creepers reach her from below and the soul-collectors unwraps around her. KAG gasps as the creeps grab her and pulls her back into the hole. KIK watches intently.</p><br>
<p>Cut to INU and KIK at the burning village. KIK draws an arrow at INU. She is seized by a pain and falls to the ground. INU rushes towards her.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Kikyo! (KIK’s fatal wound from fifty years ago starts to bleed) Kikyo has been suffering… all alone. (INU hugs KIK with eyes closed, the two of them standing among flames) Kikyo… I will never allow you to be alone again! Rest assured… I will protect you! (opens his eyes)</p>
<p>INU and KIK are no longer surrounded by flames, but stand in the dark, in a shaft of conical light. Another shaft of light appears. It is empty.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (thinking) What’s that? Does it mean there is another I must protect? Who? Who is the other one… I must protect?</p>
<p>KAG’s back view appears in the other shaft of light. She turns around and smiles at INU.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (thinking) Kagome…</p>
<p>KIK, who was clutching to INU, opens her eyes and glares hatefully at him.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (pushing KIK away from him, but still holding on to her) That’s right! What happened to Kagome? (looks at KIK) Where’s Kagome?!</p>
<p class="txt">KIK:&emsp;&ensp; (pushes herself away from INU and turns into a wooden figurine with creepers for hands) Inuyasha! Is that girl more precious to you?!</p>
<p>KIK suddenly turns into fire flames which lick at INU.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; This was all an illusion!</p>
<p>He slashes them with TET. The flames and background fades to the forest again. A shout is heard.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Miroku!</p><br>
<p>MIR is shouting in terror while the Wind Tunnel sucks him in. Cut to a perspiring MIR laying unconscious on the ground. His right hand is seized tightly by creepers. More creeper appear and aims at MIR.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (sprinting towards MIR) Miroku! (slashes the creepers) Miroku! Snap out of it! (holds up MIR)</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; (wakes and holds up his hand, terrified) My arm… The Wind Tunnel…</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (thinking) This guy is actually scared! (turns MIR around and slaps him) Miroku! Wake up!</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; The Wind Tunnel was sucking up my body…</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; The vines of this tree are the cause. Miroku, find Sango and Shippo. They’re probably under the illusionary spell of the vines, too. I’ll find Kagome! (leaps into the air) Kagome! Where are you?!</p><br>
<p>Cut to KAG lying unconscious on the ground among creepers.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (from afar) Kagome! Kagome!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(waking up) Inu…yasha…?</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (lands next to KAG) Kagome! If you touch these vines, you’ll get caught in an illusionary trap. You seem to be okay.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(shaken) Uh-huh…</p>
<p>INU holds KAG and leaps out of the hole. When they land, KAG gasps. INU turns in her direction and sees KIK holding a jewel in her palm.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Kikyo… (thinking) That’s…Kagome’s Sacred Jewel! (to Kagome) Kagome…?</p>
<p>KAG is gasping for air.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Kikyo…What did you do to Kagome…?!</p>
<p class="txt">KIK:&emsp;&ensp; What’s the matter, Inuyasha? Aren’t you going to rejoice that I am well?</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (furious) Answer me, Kikyo! What did you do to Kagome?</p>
<p class="txt">KIK:&emsp;&ensp; If I tell you that I tried to kill her, what will you do then? Will you kill me? (INU growls in anger, glaring) What captured your heart when you were under Naraku’s illusionary spell?</p>
<p>Flashback of INU holding KIK among flames.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; I… Rest assured… I will protect you.</p>
<p>Back to present. KIK sniggers and then bursts out laughing.</p>
<p class="txt">KIK:&emsp;&ensp; I doubt that you can kill me.</p>
<p>Soul-collectors appear and surround KIK. They envelope her and lifts her into the air.</p>
<p class="txt">KIK:&emsp;&ensp; (while flying away) I will be waiting for the day we can embrace death together.</p>
<p>INU looks on with clenched fists. When KIK is far away, INU turns around to KAG.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Kagome… what happened with Kikyo?</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(worried) She took my Sacred Jewel fragment… I’m sorry.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (angry) I’m not asking that!! Did Kikyo…?!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(furious) Don’t ask!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (taken aback) Kagome…</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(thinking) It’s not right… It’s like I’m snitching on her.</p>
<p>MIR appears all of a sudden, looking exhausted. He is piggy-backing SAN and carrying HIR. SHI is slung over HIR. Both of them are unconscious.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Umm… Are you finished talking?</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(thinking) To Kikyo… my life is meaningless.</p>
<p>Flashback of just now, when INU rescued her.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; If you touch these vines, you’ll get caught in an illusionary trap. You seem okay.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(shaken) Uh-huh…</p>
<p>Cut-scene of KAG lying unconscious among creepers.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(narrating) Illusionary Death… We were all put to the test by the pain and confusion in our hearts. And I… got a small glimpse into my own heart.</p>
<p>Cut to KIK and INU meeting up in a forest. They start to hold each other and kiss in bliss.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(narrating) Inside my heart… Inuyasha and Kikyo… were kissing.</p>
<p class="txtb">[ End of ACT II: 17min 34sec ]</p><br>
<p class="txtb"><a name="_ACT_III_"></a>[ ACT III ]</p>
<p>At NAR’s castle. NAR, in his Kagewaki form, sits in a room, looking pissed.</p>
<p class="txt">KIK:&emsp;&ensp; (entering the room) You are careless, Naraku.</p>
<p class="txt">NAR:&emsp;&ensp;Kikyo…</p>
<p class="txt">KIK:&emsp;&ensp; With your puppet broken, you could see nothing, huh? (NAR glaring) Remember that you petty sorcery does not work on me. And the barrier around this castle, preventing Inuyasha and the others from approaching was very easy to break.</p>
<p>KIK holds up KAG’s Sacred Jewel necklace and the jewel shard which NAR placed into a soul orb previously. She looks at them and flings them towards NAR.</p>
<p class="txt">KIK:&emsp;&ensp; You coveted this, didn’t you? I will leave it in your possession. After all, no one needs the power of the Sacred Jewel more than you… Demon Naraku… (smirks) rather half-demon Naraku.</p>
<p class="txt">NAR:&emsp;&ensp;(raises eyebrows, green light emitting from him) I, Naraku, a half-demon?</p>
<p class="txt">KIK:&emsp;&ensp; You may have disguised yourself well… but the blood of the thief, Onigumo, that courses through your veins cannot be erased. You desire the Sacred Jewel in order to become a full-fledged demon.</p>
<p class="txt">NAR:&emsp;&ensp;Then why hand me these fragments of the Sacred Jewel? Am I not the one you seek to avenge your death fifty years ago?</p>
<p class="txt">KIK:&emsp;&ensp; (scoffs) Humph… My physical self died on that day. But with this borrowed body, I feel more comfortable. I do not expect you to understand.</p>
<p>Cut to KIK walking out of the castle.</p>
<p class="txt">KIK:&emsp;&ensp; (voice-over) I will return to my shrine. I will neither run nor hide. If you have business with me, send a messenger.</p>
<p>Cut to NAR alone in room. He takes off his kimono. He examines his back.</p>
<p class="txt">NAR:&emsp;&ensp;It’s appeared again. No matter how often I change my body, the burn scars of the thief Onigumo will not disappear from my back.</p>
<p>Cut to KIK standing in a field outside NAR’s castle.</p>
<p class="txt">KIK:&emsp;&ensp; (thinking) Naraku… Go and gather the fragments of the Sacred Jewel. When you have the complete Sacred Jewel, I will send you to Hell. I am free to hate. My soul is much more free than those days.</p>
<p>Cut to flashback of INU on a sakura tree looking at KIK in the past.</p>
<p class="txt">KIK:&emsp;&ensp; (voice-over) Free to hate… Free to love…</p>
