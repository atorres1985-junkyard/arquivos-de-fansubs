<p>Nighttime in a forest. A group of women are transporting a large and heavy thing wrapped with a straw mat. A few women hold torches to light the way. They reach a boulder which juts out into a river below. They heave the large thing into the lake and walk away. The large thing floats and drifts down the river. Along the riverbank, an old villager witnessed the entire event. He examines the large thing suspiciously. The water causes the straw mat to fall apart, revealing a dried-up corpse without any skin or hair. The expression on the corpse is that of immense horror. The old villager shriek in fear and run away.</p>
<p class="txt">Villager: Help!!</p>
<p>Before he could scamper off, he bumps into a masked samurai. The samurai has arrows pierced through him and groans in pain as he struggles to walk. The old villager shriek in terror again and runs off.</p>
<p class="txt">Samurai: Hey, wait up…!</p>
<p>The samurai removes his mask to reveal a normal human being, contrary to what the old villager thought.</p>
<p class="txt">Samurai: He ran away…</p>
<p>He drops his mask and walks away.</p>

<p>Daytime on a hill. INU-gang is talking to the old villager from last night.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; A community of demoness?</p>
<p class="txt">Villager: I'm not lying, I saw it with my own eyes! I went into the forest looking for herbs and got lost. I came to the riverside in the forest… Then I saw a group of women throw something into the river.</p>

<p class="txt">Villager: I wondered too… So I took a second look, I saw a human corpse! It was them, it was the work of the demoness!</p>

<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; Those demoness sound terrifying…</p>

<p>Cut to the injured samurai from last night, struggling along a riverbank as he uses his sword as a clutch. He comes upon a young woman who is washing her clothes in the river. She notices the samurai and drops her basket in shock.</p>
<p class="txt">Samurai: Hey… Lady… Do you know of a town nearby?</p>
<p>The samurai is seized by a sharp pain and falls to his knees in the river.</p>

<p>Cut to a secluded village. The samurai is taking to a middle-aged woman in one of the huts. WAK is cooking in the background, while another girl pours sake into the samurai's cup.</p>
<p class="ttable">The middle-aged woman is called Matsu.</p>
<p class="txt">Matsu:	So that's it… You were escaping the war?</p>
<p class="txt">Samurai: But… This is definitely a strange village.</p>
<p class="txt">Matsu:	What do you mean?</p>
<p class="txt">Samurai: I've noticed earlier…</p>
<p>A group of girls are standing outside the hut and looking at the samurai suspiciously.</p>
<p class="txt">Samurai: There are only women here.</p>
<p class="txt">Matsu:	That's right. This village has no men. They've all died in the battlefields.</p>
<p class="txt">Samurai: I see, I'm sorry to hear that.</p>
<p class="txt">Matsu:	In any case, why don't you stay here for the night?</p>
<p class="txt">Samurai: Yeah. (suspicious, thinking) But there aren't any children or old people either…</p>

<p class="txt">WAK:&ensp;&nbsp; Ye… yes.</p>

<p>Evening. A young man in green clothes is struggling along the cliff wall. A deep valley is between the two cliff walls. He looks down worriedly as he struggles to climb along a narrow ledge.</p>
<p class="txt">Man:&emsp; Wakana…</p>
<p>The ledge under him crumbles a little and he tries to steady himself.</p>

<p>Cut to the samurai in an empty hut. He wakes and notices the evening sky.</p>
<p class="txt">Samurai: (gasps and sits up) I fell asleep…? (looks around) I'm… in a shrine?</p>
<p>He notices a simple altar behind him, placed in front of a hanging scroll of the Goddess of Mercy.</p>
<p class="txt">Samurai: (walks up to scroll) A drawing? Why is it glowing?</p>
<p>He reaches out to touch the scroll, which melts a little and sticks to his fingers. A laughter is heard. Something throbs inside the samurai and he is taken aback. Suddenly, a large light-blue face that seems to be made of water, without hair or skin, appears out of the scroll and moves towards the samurai menacingly. He yells in horror and tries to get out of the shrine, but the door is locked. Cut to sound of the crunching of bones and blood splattering. Cut to close-up of the forearm of the samurai, which is dried and skinless.</p>
<br>
<p>Cut to INU-gang. MIR suddenly gasps and turns around.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;What's wrong, Priest?</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; I just felt an evil presence!</p>
<p>KIR roars and transforms into her fierce form. SAN jumps onto her. Cut to INU-gang running.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Evil presence?</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Yes, I believe so.</p>
<br>
<p>INU-gang lands at the boulder which juts out into the river.</p>

<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Yes, this is the place.</p>

<p>The body of the young man from earlier on floats towards them.</p>

<p>INU grabs the man and makes a curious sound.</p>

<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Don't be so rude!</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; So… You're looking for your lost fiancée, not knowing where she is.</p>
<p class="txt">SHN:&emsp;&ensp;Yes. Just 3 days before the wedding, I was forced to go to war. And I have not returned in 2 years due to my injuries. Then I finally returned to my hometown a couple of days back… Only to find it in ashes… And there wasn't a single trace of my fiancée, Wakana…</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Oh my…</p>
<p class="txt">SHN:&emsp;&ensp;I didn't know what to do… I went in search of her without knowing if she is dead or alive. Then I heard of this community of women that lives around here.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; (flabbergasted) A community of women?</p>
<p class="txt">SHN:&emsp;&ensp;And from what I heard, this community houses the women who have lost their husbands and children to war. So… I thought that maybe Wakana is staying there.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(whispers to SAN) Hey, do you think this has anything to do with the demoness?</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Yeah… since it's all women.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; (stands determinedly) I got it! Let us come with you!</p>
<p class="txt">SHN:&emsp;&ensp;But we have to find them first.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Nope.</p>
<p>Everyone gasps and looks at INU.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; I think they've already found us.</p>
<p>In the direction where INU is looking, two women are spying on them in the distance. They walk away.</p>

<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; What will you do now?</p>
<p class="txt">SHN:&emsp;&ensp;I'll keep on searching. I cannot give up now. All I want… is to be with Wakana again.</p>

<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (shouts) Hey!! Are you listening?!</p>

<p>INU, shocked, falls to the ground.</p>

<p>MIR is taken aback and at a loss of words. SHN sighs, followed by MIR.</p>

<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(worried) Where could she be?</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Sango's smell ends here… I don't know where that smell is coming from…</p>
<p>Suddenly, suddenly bubbles in the water.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Wha… what?</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Stay back, Kagome!</p>
<p>The women burst out of the water and floats in midair, each holding a weapon in their hand. They are expressionless.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;The villagers?!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Damn it, what did you do to Sango?! (flexes claws) Tell me or else I'll…</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Wait, Inuyasha! Look at the evil energy in their mouths.</p>
<p>A green aura emits from the women's mouths. SHI gasps in horror.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Someone is controlling them for sure. Don't hurt them.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; So we've found it after all. The demoness are all here!</p>
<br>
<p>Cut to shrine, which is glowing with a green aura. Inside, Woman 1 is lying in MIR's lap.</p>
<p class="txt">Woman 1: Thank you for your consolation, Priest.</p>
<p class="txt">Woman 1 looks at MIR, her eyes are glazed. MIR gasps.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; (thinking) Evil aura… Something is in her stomach? (sighs and groans, thinking) Why does this always have to happen?</p>
<p class="txt">Woman 1: Is something the matter?</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; You're being controlled, aren't you? And it must be…!!</p>
<p>MIR spins and looks at the scroll. The large watery face bursts out of the scroll and crashes into MIR, but he dodges.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; What kind of a demon are you?!</p>
<p class="txt">Face:&emsp; Give me your skin…</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; My skin?</p>
<br>
<p>Cut to SAN in an underwater cave, chained to the wall. She regains unconsciousness. Matsu walks up to her with a torch.</p>
<p class="txt">Matsu:	You're awake?</p>
<p>SAN struggles but the chain holds her down.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Where am I?</p>
<p class="txt">Matsu:	You'll be one of us…</p>
<p>Matsu places the torch on the wall. She walks to the edge of the cave which opens into a pool of water. She kneels down and takes out a line of eggs in the water. The water is filled with such green eggs.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;What is that? Are they eggs?</p>
<p class="txt">Matsu:	(holds up one egg) Now, swallow this.</p>
<p>SAN turns her face away and Matsu grabs her face.</p>
<p class="txt">Matsu:	Just swallow this whole. Soon the egg will hatch in your stomach. And then you shall become one of us…</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;(thinking) Damn… damn it…</p>
<br>
<p>Cut to INU, KAG and SHI facing the women on the river.</p>
<br>
<p>Cut to MIR facing off with the watery face in the shrine.</p>
<br>
<p>Back with SAN and Matsu. SAN struggles but Matsu is slowly placing the egg towards her mouth.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Who cares for this…?!</p>

<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Sango is controlled by the demon, and started attacking Miroku! How can they fight each other?!</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; You swallowed that strange thing? I'll save you! This won't be as easy as the rest… Sango, it's a fearful thing to be your enemy. But I can't surrender!</p>
