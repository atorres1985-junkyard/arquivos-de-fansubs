<p>In the cave in the village of the Demon Slayers, where the statue of Midoriko is. A scholarly man with a flowery haori walks in.</p>
<p class="txt">Scholarly man: I suppose you must have been a beauty when you were still alive, Midoriko… The power to create the Sacred Jewel was in that beauty.</p>
<p>The man walks out, only the backview of him is seen.</p><br>

<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (frowning) We don't know where Naraku is right now. Why are you guys relaxing? Eat faster!</p>
<p>INU grabs some rice balls and stuff them down. He then takes big gulps of water to wash them down.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Since Naraku's disappearance, all the demons that were in hiding are now out to create trouble. It's a big problem…</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; So what?</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; So, we should eat and relax for now…!</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; (chiding, folded arms) Can't you be more mature, Inuyasha?</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; W-What?</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; Kagome is a weak human. She's not as powerful as us. (closes eyes) You don't have to be so harsh!</p>
<p>KAG laughs.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;(in disbelief) He said you're weak…</p>

<p>KAG points towards a forest in the distance.</p>

<p>Cut to a dinosaur-like demon chasing the scholarly man in the flowery haori.</p>
<p class="txt">Demon: (slow) Hold it. Stop there.</p>
<p>INU appears in front of them.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Leave that to me!</p>
<p>The scholarly man walks to the rest of INU-gang while INU runs towards the demon.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; It's okay now.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Are you alright?</p>
<p class="txt">Scholarly man: Y-yes.</p>
<p class="txt">Demon: What are you doing? Do you intend to stop me?</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Is this the thing, Kagome?</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Yes, there's a fragment in his stomach. But…</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Bastard, where did you get that fragment?! (puts hand on TET's sheath)</p>
<p class="txt">Demon: (laughs) I have the Sacred Jewel, you should know better than to challenge me!</p>

<p>INU jumps through the fumes and slashes the demon into two.</p>
<p class="txt">Demon: Impossible! It's not suppose to be like this!</p>
<p>Both the two parts of the demon and INU land. A Sacred Jewel fragment flies out of the demon's body.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;That is… the Sacred Jewel!</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; It can't be!</p>
<p>INU catches the Sacred Jewel which is a whole. He holds it up and it shatters.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; What?!</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; Inuyasha broke the Sacred Jewel fragment!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Fool! The Sacred Jewel is not so fragile!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;But, it felt like the real thing.</p>
<p class="txt">Scholarly man: That's a poorly made Sacred Jewel.</p>
<p>Everyone looks at him.</p>
<p class="txt">Scholarly man: There's a demon who's been trying to create a Sacred Jewel.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; What do you mean?</p>
<p class="txt">Scholarly man: I'm terribly sorry, but can I have some water first?</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(hands him a water bottle) Here, take this.</p>

<p class="txt">IZU:&emsp;&nbsp; I see. So you must be a priestess.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; So?	</p>
<p class="txt">IZU:&emsp;&nbsp; As a <i>Guuji,</i> I need to be well-learned, so I traveled and did my researches, so as to gain more knowledge.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; I don't want to hear about you. I want to learn about that fake jewel.</p>
<p class="txt">IZU:&emsp;&nbsp; I started a new study recently, and it's on the Sacred Jewel.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;So, that's how you knew about the Sacred Jewel.</p>
<p class="txt">IZU:&emsp;&nbsp; It is actually made of four spirits.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; You mean the Ara Spirit, the Migi Spirit, the Kushi Spirit and the Saki Spirit. It's the union of the four spirits that form the soul.</p>

<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; The demon didn't call himself Naraku, right?</p>
<p class="txt">IZU:&emsp;&nbsp; No. He called himself Orochidayu. He said the jewel is fake, but assure that there'll be a real one soon.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Are you saying that a demon is creating a Sacred Jewel?</p>
<p class="txt">IZU:&emsp;&nbsp; That's what I heard.</p><br>
<p>INU-gang and IZU arrive at the valley that IZU was referring too. SAN flies away on KIR to survey the area.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; I don't feel the presence of demons here.</p>
<p class="txt">IZU:&emsp;&nbsp; He handed over the jewel right over there.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (sniffs the air) I can't smell Naraku. I don't think he's involved.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; What do you think, Kagome? Do you sense the Sacred Jewel fragments?</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(shakes head) No. I can't feel it. Anyway the feeling wasn't that strong earlier.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Because it's a fake!</p>

<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Hey, what are you doing?</p>
<p>The birds, frightened by INU's voice, fly away in a hurry.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Hey!</p>
<p class="txt">IZU:&emsp;&nbsp; (looks at INU) I heard that, over here, people pray to the God who created Earth.</p>

<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; It's empty.</p>
<p>Cut to the rest of INU-gang arriving at the shrine.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;God who created Earth?</p>

<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; (to KAG) Don't you think he has strange thoughts?</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;No, it's the first time that someone in this era is curious about things like that.</p>

<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; Now I get it. I got confused with all the different spirits.</p>
<p class="txt">IZU:&emsp;&nbsp; Ara of Yuu for bravery. Migi of Shin for faith. Kushi of Chi for knowledge. (walks towards a tree) Unify all the spirits, together with a good and an evil soul, and you'll have the Sacred Jewel.</p>

<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; No we didn't! The others ran away! Sango! (pointing) They're over there. Let's go!</p>
<p>Cut to INU-gang running.</p>
<p class="txtb">[ End of ACT II: 19min 24sec ]</p><br>
<p class="txtb"><a name="AIII"></a>[ ACT III ]</p>
<p>In a cave. The villagers are each enveloped in a toad embryo, frozen in action. A toad demon looks at them and laughs.</p>
<p class="txt">Toad Demon: They look like delicious souls!</p>
<p class="txt">ORO:&emsp; Don't eat them, Gamajiro. (walks in with SHO under his arm) Take the soul of this kid too. (flings SHO to the ground)</p>
<p>SHO rouses and notices his parents in two embryos.</p>
<p class="txt">SHO:&emsp;&ensp;Father! Mother! (runs up to them)</p>
<p class="ttable">* Gamajiro abbreviated as GAM from now onwards. Gamajiro is short for Tsukumo no Gama Jiro, or Toad of Tsukumo, the Second. *</p>
<p class="txt">GAM:&emsp; (laughs) You'll be with them soon.</p>
<p>An ox-like demon marches up to IZU.</p>
<p class="txt">ORO:&emsp; Gyuoh. Let's see how good your skills are.</p><br>
<p>Cut to INU-gang walking along a mountain path. As it is nighttime, SHI lights up the way using his fox fire.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; Is this the way, Inuyasha?</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Yeah. I smell a lot of demons here.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; What about you, Kagome?</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;I think that this is the right way, but I can't really feel those Sacred Jewels.</p>
<p>A loud growl is heard and the ground shakes.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;I feel the presence of a Sacred Jewel coming this way!</p>
<p>INU unsheathes TET, but before he can do anything, he is thrown off into the air. He lands and growls angrily.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Bastard!</p>
<p class="ttable">* The ox-like demon, Gyuoh, abbreviated as GYU from now onwards *</p>
<p>GYU appears in front of INU with a club in his hand. KAG gasps. The small protrusions on the club glow in pink.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Those are all fake Sacred Jewels!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; What did you say?</p>
<p class="txt">GYU:&emsp;&ensp;Come here, you stupid half-demon!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (sprints) So what… if I'm a half-demon!!!</p>
<p>INU swings TET at GYU, who blocks easily with his club. GYU opens his mouth and spews dark fumes at INU.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (wincing) It's demonic energy!</p>
<p>GYU pushes forward and INU is thrown off. INU somersaults and lands. SAN, on KIR in the air, throws HIR at GYU, who slams it aside. SHI and SAN gasp.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; He's strong!</p>
<p>KAG then fires a Sacred Arrow at GYU. It hits him, but it merely breaks, leaving GYU intact.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; It's not over yet!</p>
<p>INU throws a Wind Scar at GYU, but it doesn't affect him.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Even the Wind Scar…!</p>
<p class="txt">GYU:&emsp;&ensp;Priestess… The Priestess of the Sacred Jewel.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;What?</p>
<p class="txt">GYU:&emsp;&ensp;If humans souls aren't polished, they are only simply stones.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(thinking) What is he saying?</p>
<p>GYU raises his club and shouts. Light rays emit from his club. GYU then slams it onto the ground. The ground cracks and caves in. INU-gang galls in.</p>

<p class="txt">GYU:&emsp;&ensp;Priestess… The Sacred Jewel fragments and your soul would be the ingredients for the new Sacred Jewel! But these are not enough. I need more souls! I will use the power of the Sacred Jewel to break free from my fate!</p>
