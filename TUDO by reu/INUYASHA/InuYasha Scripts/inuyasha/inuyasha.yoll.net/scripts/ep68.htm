<ul><li>This is the first time that Sango offers her demon slaying skills in exchange for payment. It is also the first time that she doesn't flinch when Miroku asks for a pretty girl.</li>
<li>When Shippo fell over after being frightened by Inuyasha, his hands made a 'I Love You' sign. (see image) </li>
<li>It is strange that Souten understands when Kagome used the term 'Boy' in English on him.</li>
<li>The voice actress for Koryu, OHTANI Ikue, is the voice of Pikachu in <i>Pokemon</i>.</li></ul>
<p class="ttextb">Comments</p>
<ul><li>This is definitely a fan-service episode for Shippo fans. Brimming with cute drawings and even cuter fights, it provides relief from the heavy stories in the previous episodes. The delusional ideas of Shippo about himself as a strong fighter is played to its maximum effect here, providing much laughs.</li>
<li>Koryu changes into a thunder cloud when it is thumped on the head three times. I think Shippo would love to have this ability, considering how much Inuyasha thumps him.</li></ul></td>

<p>Daytime. SHI, alone, walks in a wide open field cheerfully. He is eating a lollipop.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; (narrating) My name is Shippo. I'm the baby fox demon of justice! With vassals Inuyasha and others, I roam the countryside conquering evil demons. But sometimes, even I need a break from time to time.</p>
<p>Suddenly dark clouds appear across the sky and cover the sun.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; (narrating) But the peace was to last but a moment.</p>
<p>Lightning flashes across the sky. A bolt strikes towards SHI and he panics, running around in circles. The bolt strikes the ground and dissipates, leaving an arrow with an envelope tied around its stem.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; An arrow bearing a message! (takes the envelope and reads it) What?!</p>
<p class="txt"><i>Cut to close-up of envelope, which bear the words</i> 「果た~狀」.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; A challenge to a duel?!</p>
<p class="txt"><i>SHI turns the envelope around, and the words</i> 「雷獣  蒼天」 <i>are written.</i></p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; (shocked) Raiju… Souten? (narrating) This was just a prelude to my continuing life as a fighting warrior.</p>
<p>SHI looks up in a dramatic manner, awaiting the challenge. The screen freezes in manga-style.</p>

<p class="txtb">[ ACT II ]<a name="_ACT_II_"></a></p>
<p>A cloud travels in the sky across a rocky and mountainous landscape. Lightning flashes across the sky constantly. Cut to a broken down manor on a mountain. The cloud enters the manor and into a room, in which a silhouette of a person writing is seen.</p>
<p class="txt">Cloud:&nbsp; Lord Souten, I have delivered the letter.</p>
<p>Cut to silhouette of a statue. Lightning flashes and the fiery expression of the statue is reveal.</p>
<p class="txt">Cloud:&nbsp; The time has come.</p>
<p>Cut to image of Raigekijin, Hiten's pike weapon, hung on the wall.</p>
<p class="txt">Cloud:&nbsp; I, Koryu, have waited so long for this day. Lord Souten, I beseech you to do your utmost as the sole survivor of the Raiju Tribe!</p>
<p class="ttable">* Souten and Koryu abbreviated as SOU and KOR from now onwards. *</p>
<p>SOU grins.</p><br>
<p>SHI sits in the open field and reads the letter.</p>
<p class="txt">『 七宝殿へ</p>
<p class="txt">雷獣一族の誇りそ賭け、正々堂々と &nbsp;&nbsp;決岡と申し入れる</p>
<p class="txt">本日夕割 &nbsp;&nbsp;雷鳴谷 &nbsp;&nbsp;にて待つ</p>
<p class="txt">遠げれば仲間遠の命は無いと思へ 』</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; Let's see… &quot;To Shippo… To uphold the honour of the Raiju Tribe, I challenge you to a duel to the death. On this day at sundown, I await your coming at Raimei Valley. If you dare run away, fear for the lives of your friends.&quot;</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Is that a challenge to a duel?</p>
<p>SHI is shocked when he realizes MIR, SAN, INU and KAG were reading over his shoulder.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Raimei Valley is nearby.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Isn't that where the Thunder Brothers used to live?</p>
<p>Cut to image of Hiten and Manten, from episodes 9-10.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;I wonder if this is the relative of Hiten and Manten?</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; He has the nerves to send a challenge like that…</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; Hey you! Don't read my letter!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;But it's strange…</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; What is?</p>
<p>Cut to flashback of INU's fight with the Thunder Brothers in episode 10. Manten was killed by TET thrust into his back. Cut to INU slashing Hiten into two with TET.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(voice-over) If the Raiju Tribe wanted revenge, their enemy should be Shippo… But, Inuyasha, who actually fought the brothers.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (voice-over) That's right!</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; (voice-over) Well, that's probably because Inuyasha is a half-demon and not good enough for the Raiju Tribe.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; What?!!</p>
<p>Cut to present. INU thumps SHI on his head and a huge bump grows.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(kneels next to SHI) What will you do? Will you fight this Souten?</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; (folds his arms smugly) Can't be helped. If I avenged my Dad's death, someone will come after me in vengeance. (nodding to himself) That's the fate of fighters.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (scoffs and folds his arms) What a show off!</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; (points a finger at INU) You're just jealous that I'm better!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (riled) What?!</p>
<p>Cut to MIR and SAN kneeling next to SHI.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Need our help? We'll make it real cheap.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Feel free to ask. All I want in payment is a pretty girl…</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(chiding) You two…!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (scoffs and looks away) I won't lift a finger no matter what happens!</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; (waves a hand confidently) Don't worry! I can handle the Raiju Tribe!</p>
<p>Suddenly, a bolt of lightning flashes across the sky, followed by a loud thunder. SHI freezes and trembles, but still tries to look confident.</p><br>
<p>INU-gang stand on a cliff facing a valley.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;That's the valley where the Thunder Brothers lived.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; I can feel the bad aura already…</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Yeah… Extremely bad weather there…</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(squats next to a trembling SHI) Shippo, don't be proud. Ask them for help.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; No…! If I did, I'd lose my honour to this challenge!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Boo!</p>
<p>INU scares SHI by yelling loudly next to him suddenly. SHI shrieks in terror.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (laughs and straightens himself) What honour?! Stop boasting already!</p>
<p>INU stops teasing SHI when he sees SHI fallen on his back, with swirly eyes and green face.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Oh dear… This is bad.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; I think so.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Me too.</p><br>
<p>In the Raiju residence. The cloud floats around while SOU is writing.</p>
<p class="txt">KOR:&emsp;&ensp;What are you writing, Lord Souten?</p>
<p>The screen pans up to reveal SOU to be an intelligent and determined looking kid.</p>
<p class="txt">SOU:&emsp;&nbsp;Koryu… Stop floating around and come here!</p>
<p class="txt">KOR:&emsp;&ensp;Yes!</p>
<p>A red hand reaches out of the cloud and thumps itself three times. Suddenly, the cloud dissipates to reveal a cute little red dragon with mini-wings. He flies towards SOU.</p>
<p class="txt">SOU:&emsp;&nbsp;This is our strategy. Memorize it well.</p>
<p class="txt">KOR:&emsp;&ensp;(shocked) Strategy? Aren't you going to fight fair and square?</p>
<p class="txt">SOU:&emsp;&nbsp;(shakes head and spits violently) Pu! Pu! Pu! Pu! Pu! (sits on the floor with a few drawings) Do you think a cute child like me has a chance against those ruffians?!</p>
<p class="txt">KOR:&emsp;&ensp;Well, that's true…</p>
<p>Cut to ink drawing of vicious looking MIR flashing his Wind Tunnel.</p>
<p class="txt">SOU:&emsp;&nbsp;This monk named Miroku has a Wind Tunnel that sucks up everything!</p>
<p>Cut to ink drawing of vicious looking SAN with HIR on a fierce KIR.</p>
<p class="txt">SOU:&emsp;&nbsp;This Sango is an expert Demon Slayer! Furthermore, she has a demon cat named Kirara.</p>
<p class="txt">KOR:&emsp;&ensp;I know that. I did the research.</p>
<p>Cut to ink drawing of vicious looking INU with TET, piggybacking a crazy looking KAG who is holding up her bow.</p>
<p class="txt">SOU:&emsp;&nbsp;Plus, this Inuyasha and Kagome duo are worse! How many demons do you think have fallen at their feet?</p>
<p>KOR grunts disinterestedly. Cut to SOU with folded arms.</p>
<p class="txt">SOU:&emsp;&nbsp;I will not live if I fought fair and square! That would mean the absolute extinction of the Raiju Tribe!</p>
<p class="txt">KOR:&emsp;&ensp;So… Isn't it better to just live peacefully?</p>
<p class="txt">SOU:&emsp;&nbsp;(steps on a drawing of SHI) No!! They are my sworn enemies! I must get Shippo, at least!</p>
<p class="txt">KOR:&emsp;&ensp;(sighs) Oh dear…</p>
<p class="txt">SOU:&emsp;&nbsp;(fierce) Stop complaining and put this plan into action!! They are already nearby!</p>
<p class="txt">KOR:&emsp;&ensp;(panics) Alright! (spins around and flies off)</p><br>
<p>Cut to close-up of SHI's legs, who is walking very very slowly. Cut to INU with folded arms, looking exasperated.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (yelling) Shippo… You…! Stop stalling time!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Hey, calm down.</p>
<p>KAG tries to calm INU down. KIR, SAN and MIR are seated on the ground, waiting for SHI.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Shippo, you won't be able to make it by sunset at this rate. He set the timing, right?</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; That's right! The challenge! (takes out the letter) Say Kagome…</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Yes?</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; (points to his name on the letter) This is ONLY read as &quot;Shippo&quot;?</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Yes.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; Does it look like other words? For example, &quot;Inuyasha&quot;?</p>
<p>Sweatdrops appear across KAG's head.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Can't you read your own name?!</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; (angry, almost crying) Don't tease me! I was just checking! Yes, it's me! It's a letter challenging me!</p>
<p>Cut to close up of SHI feet. He raises his right foot and steps back in place, then raises his left.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; Just wait, Souten! I'm coming!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Shippo… You're not making any progress.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; I can't stand it any longer!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;I-Inuyasha!</p><br>
<p>At Raimei valley. INU-gang walks along a mountain path. INU uses TET to push SHI along.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; All right, everyone! I really don't need any help this time!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Yeah right! Move it!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(chiding) Inuyasha!</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; The opponent is a member of the dreaded Raiju Tribe! Kagome, you can take shelter somewhere safe.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(smiling) All right.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; You too, Sango and Miroku!</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;(to MIR) He really needs help.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; I think so.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(thinking) He'd only need to ask…</p>
<p>Pan upwards the cliff face where INU-gang is walking. KOR is prying a huge boulder over the edge, struggling hard. Cut to flashback of SOU showing KOR a drawing of SHI separated from INU-gang with a huge boulder.</p>
<p class="txt">SOU:&emsp;&nbsp;First, we separate Shippo from the others with a boulder.</p>
<p>Cut to present. KOR manages to push the boulder over and it rolls down the cliff swiftly. The rolling noise cause INU-gang look up. KAG gasps.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (grabs KAG) Kagome! (leaps off)</p>
<p>SAN and MIR fly up on SHI.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Shippo!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; What's he doing?!</p>
<p>SHI is panicking and running around in circles as the boulder rolls towards him. It crashes onto the ground near him and he is thrown off the cliff. The boulder continues to roll downwards and chases SHI, who is running frantically.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; Nooooo!</p>
<p class="txt">KOR:&emsp;&ensp;(laughs and looks on from above) It went well, Lord Souten!</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; (running and yelling) Oh yes! I forgot! (takes out a leaf) Change!</p>
<p>SHI transforms into his pink flying form and floats upwards in relief. A net suddenly appears and traps SHI. It is KOR. He flies away, dragging SHI in the net.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; (crying) Help!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Shippo!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; That klutz!</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; He's done for.</p>
<p>KIR chases KOR and SHI.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Damn! He's hopeless!</p><br>
<p>In the Raiju residence. SHI is trapped in a cage.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; Hey! Let me out!</p>
<p class="txt">SOU:&emsp;&nbsp;(walks up to the cage and laughs) Welcome Shippo!</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; (upon seeing a kid) I don't have any business with a small fry like you. Where's your leader? Call Souten, the leader of the Raiju Tribe.</p>
<p class="txt">SOU:&emsp;&nbsp;That's me.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; (gasps) Huh? You must be lying.</p>
<p class="txt">SOU:&emsp;&nbsp;I'm not! Can't you see?</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; (thinking) No, I can't. That's why I'm asking. (to SOU) How stupid! I don't have time to play with a kid.</p>
<p class="txt">SOU:&emsp;&nbsp;(clenches fists angrily) What?! Don't treat me like a kid!</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; (teasing) Oh, really? (takes out a toy and starts playing with it)</p>
<p class="txt">SOU:&emsp;&nbsp;Oh…? That looks fun… Let me have it.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; See? You ARE a kid!</p>
<p class="txt">SOU:&emsp;&nbsp;Pu pu pu!! What about you?!</p>
<p>KOR looks on disinterestedly as SOU and SHI quarrel.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; What? I'm a full-fledged demon!</p>
<p class="txt">SOU:&emsp;&nbsp;So am I! Stop blabbering and give it to me!</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; No way!</p>
<p class="txt">SOU:&emsp;&nbsp;Give it to me!</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; No way! No way!</p>
<p class="txt">KOR:&emsp;&ensp;They're both so childish.</p>
<p class="txt">SOU:&emsp;&nbsp;(throws a paper onto KOR's head, fierce) Hey Koryu! There are things you must do!</p>
<p class="txt">KOR:&emsp;&ensp;Oh, yes… You're right.</p><br>
<p>MIR and SAN, on KIR's back, approach a forest. A trail of smoke appears in the middle of the forest.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; What's that?</p>
<p>Cut to an opening in the forest. KOR is standing on a pile of smoking leaves, fanning disinterestedly. Cut to flashback of SOU showing him a drawing of KIR delighting at the smell of a pile of leaves.</p>
<p class="txt">SOU:&emsp;&nbsp;Next, we'll take Kirara out. Even if she transforms, she's still just a cat. She should get drunk on silvervine.</p>
<p>Back to present.</p>
<p class="txt">KOR:&emsp;&ensp;Evil minds are so active…</p>
<p>Cut to KIR flying into the smoke. She growls in delight.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;What's the matter, Kirara?</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; This smell is silvervine.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;What?</p>
<p>KIR suddenly dives towards the forest and SAN shrieks in horror. Cut to a cute KIR lying on the pile of silvervine leaves. She lets out a meow of contentment and goes to sleep. MIR and SAN look on helplessly.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Oh no… Is this another trap?</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; We'll just have to walk from here.</p>
<p>A sobbing sound is heard in the background. SAN and MIR turn around to find a woman kneeling on the ground, with her back towards them.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; (gentle) What's the matter, Miss?</p>
<p>SAN bows her head in exasperation. Cut to KOR hiding behind a bush and mimicking a woman's voice. The woman is actually a dummy.</p>
<p class="txt">KOR:&emsp;&ensp;Please help me…</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Miroku! Be careful! It may be a trap!</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; (serious) Sango, I live according to Buddha's teachings. No matter what, I'll never turn my back on someone in need. (raise his hand righteously) If this is a trap, I'll gladly fall into it.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;(bends over, exasperated) You're SUCH a nice person, Miroku.</p>
<p>Cut to flashback of SOU showing KOR a drawing of MIR chasing a pretty girl. SAN follows behind him in disappointment.</p>
<p class="txt">SOU:&emsp;&nbsp;Miroku's weakness is women. And Sango cannot leave Miroku alone. We'll use those traits to our advantage to get them!</p>
<p>Cut to present.</p>
<p class="txt">KOR:&emsp;&ensp;Please… Please come closer.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; (walks forward) Oh yes, of course.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;(follows) Stop, Miroku!</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; (puts a hand on the dummy's shoulder) Please tell me what's wrong…</p>
<p>Suddenly the ground gives away. MIR, SAN and the dummy fall into a deep pit below.</p>
<p class="txt">KOR:&emsp;&ensp;(flying and looking into the pit) Good!</p>
<p>SAN, MIR and the dummy fall into a pile.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Didn't I tell you?! It's all your fault!</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; I'm ashamed of myself.</p>
<p>The head of the dummy breaks.</p><br>
<p>Back with SHI and SOU.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; Let me out! I thought you wanted a duel!</p>
<p class="txt">SOU:&emsp;&nbsp;(smug) Don't try to intimidate me.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; What?! Didn't you send this?! (takes out the challenge)</p>
<p class="txt">SOU:&emsp;&nbsp;Fool! That was just a trap to lure you out!</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; Trap?! (pauses) What're you planning to do with me?!</p>
<p class="txt">SOU:&emsp;&nbsp;(sniggers) I'm going to kill you very slowly.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; What?!</p>
<p class="txt">SOU:&emsp;&nbsp;(laughs) You can cry and scream all you want! (laughs louder)</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; (thinking) Damn! (gasps and squints at SOU) Oh, I know… You're weak.</p>
<p>SOU stops laughing, and an eyebrow twitches.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; That's why you're avoiding a fight.</p>
<p class="txt">SOU:&emsp;&nbsp;You're pretty shrewd. But…! I'm smart. In order to compensate for my weakness, I've come up with brilliant strategies!</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; That's dirty, you coward!</p>
<p class="txt">SOU:&emsp;&nbsp;Silence! You're the coward! Depending on people for help!</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; I did not ask them for help!</p>
<p class="txt">SOU:&emsp;&nbsp;Excuses! Weakling!</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; I'm not a weakling! Coward!</p>
<p class="txt">SOU:&emsp;&nbsp;(holds up and points to an ink drawing of a wailing SHI) Weakling! Weakling! Weakling!</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; (holds up and points to a crayon drawing of a crying SOU) Coward! Coward! Coward! Coward!</p><br>
<p>INU and KAG walk along a path.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; What are Miroku and Sango doing?!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;They're late.</p>
<p class="txt">KOR:&emsp;&ensp;(peeping from behind a rock) All right, here they come.</p>
<p>Cut to flashback of SOU showing KOR a drawing of KAG 'sitting' INU.</p>
<p class="txt">SOU:&emsp;&nbsp;Inuyasha is helpless against Kagome's &quot;sit&quot; command. So this is it!</p>
<p>Cut to present. An ugly dummy of KAG suddenly appears on the path.</p>
<p class="txt">Fake-Kagome: Inuyasha! Sit!</p>
<p>Nothing happens. INU and KAG are speechless.</p>
<p class="txt">Fake-Kagome: Sit! Sit! Sit! Sit! Sit!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Hey!</p>
<p class="txt">KOR:&emsp;&ensp;(pops out of fake-Kagome's hair) Why?! Why doesn't Kagome's &quot;sit&quot; work?!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(eyebrows twitching in anger) What?! That's supposed to be ME?!</p>
<p class="txt">KOR:&emsp;&ensp;(proud) Isn't she identical?</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(furious) What's identical about her?!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (flexes his claws threateningly) I hope you're prepared for this…</p>
<p class="txt">KOR:&emsp;&ensp;Oh, I have to be getting back. (flies up slowly)</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (grabs KOR's tail) As if I'll let you go!</p>
<p class="txt">KOR:&emsp;&ensp;(nervous) Oh dear…</p><br>
<p>Back to SOU and SHI. Ink drawings of SHI and crayon drawings of SOU in unflattering expressions are strewn across the floor.</p>
<p class="txt">SOU:&emsp;&nbsp;(panting) Well?! Give up?</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; (panting) You're the one who has to surrender!</p>
<p class="txt">SOU:&emsp;&nbsp;(looks at SHI's crayon drawings) You have strange writing tools by the way…</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; (holding up crayons) These? Kagome gave me these… They're called crayons.</p>
<p class="txt">SOU:&emsp;&nbsp;How nice! Give them to me.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; No way!</p>
<p class="txt">SOU:&emsp;&nbsp;Give them to me! Stingy!</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; Let's see… I may consider it if you let me out.</p>
<p>SOU is taken aback. SHI starts to draw on a piece of paper, humming to himself cheerfully and with his back towards SOU. He turns around and holds up a drawing of a rainbow, showing off the coloured crayons.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; Look! Isn't it nice?</p>
<p class="txt">SOU:&emsp;&nbsp;(rolling and whining on the ground) I want them! Want them! Want them!</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; Let me out then…</p>
<p class="txt">SOU:&emsp;&nbsp;(sits up) I won't fall for that. I'm going to kill you slowly.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; Then let's fight! And the winner can have the crayons.</p>
<p class="txt">SOU:&emsp;&nbsp;Oh, that's a good idea!</p>
<p>SOU proceeds to unlock the cage. SHI turns his back to SOU, sniggering smugly to himself.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; (thinking) He can be so dumb…</p><br>
<p>Back to INU, KAG and KOR. INU is holding a nonplussed KOR in his hand.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;How unusual… A flying snake.</p>
<p class="txt">KOR:&emsp;&ensp;I'm a dragon!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (punches KOR on the head) Don't talk big! You're a Raiju demon, aren't you?</p>
<p class="txt">KOR:&emsp;&ensp;How dare you! I belong to the honourable dragon…!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (punches KOR on the head again) Don't talk big, I said!</p>
<p class="txt">KOR:&emsp;&ensp;(thinking) Damn… Just one more time! (yells) Hey! What do you think my head is?!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (raising his fist) Shut up!</p>
<p class="txt">KOR:&emsp;&ensp;(thinking) Now I'll be able to escape.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Inuyasha! Enough already. Poor thing.</p>
<p>INU scoffs, puts down his fist and looks away.</p>
<p class="txt">KOR:&emsp;&ensp;(thinking) Kagome! Stay out of it! (yells) I don't need your pity! I belong to the Dragon Tribe! Just hit me all you want!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (jeeringly) You're pretty brave, aren't you?</p>
<p class="txt">KOR:&emsp;&ensp;(thinking) Damn… It didn't work.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Come one… Where is Souten? Shippo's with him, right?</p>
<p class="txt">KOR:&emsp;&ensp;I won't tell! (bites INU's hand)</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (winces in pain) Why you…! (thumps KOR on the head again)</p>
<p class="txt">KOR:&emsp;&ensp;(recoils in pain) Finally…!</p>
<p>A puff of smoke appears around KOR, who turns into a cloud and flies up into the sky.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; What?!</p>
<p class="txt">KOR:&emsp;&ensp;(laughs) Shocked? I'll transform when my head is hit 3 times! (throws lightning arrows towards INU and KAG) Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Damn!</p>
<p>INU shields KAG and puts his Fire Rat Robe over KAG.</p>
<p class="txt">KOR:&emsp;&ensp;Go! Go! Go! Go!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (leaps into the air with TET) Why didn't you come at us from the start? (slashes the cloud into two)</p>
<p class="txt">KOR:&emsp;&ensp;Useless! It's useless! (the cloud joins back)</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (lands and looks up) What?!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Tetsusaiga won't work on him!</p>
<p class="txt">KOR:&emsp;&ensp;(laughs) Now Inuyasha! Prepare to die!</p><br>
<p>In the courtyard of the Raiju residence. SHI and SOU stand across each other in a face-off stance.</p>
<p class="txt">SOU:&emsp;&nbsp;Are you ready, Shippo?!</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; That's my line! (leaps) Take this!</p><br>
<p>KOR continues throwing lightning arrows at INU and KAG, who are running away. The arrows strike the ground and explodes everything around them.</p>
<p class="txt">KOR:&emsp;&ensp;Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; What the hell do we do?!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;If the opponent is a cloud, the Wind Scar won't work.</p>
<p>KAG suddenly trips and falls. The Fire Rat Robe falls away from KAG. INU stops and turns around, worried.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Kagome!</p>
<p class="txt">KOR:&emsp;&ensp;(flies higher) Now! I'll take care of the girl first! (shoots a huge arrow towards KAG)</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (panics, runs to KAG with outstretched hand) Kagome!</p>
<p>INU leaps and the arrow strikes INU instead. He lets out a groan of pain as he crashes to the ground.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;I-Inuyasha! Inuyasha!</p><br>
<p>SHI leaps and throws a ball of foxfire at SOU.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; Take this! Fox fire!</p>
<p class="txt">SOU:&emsp;&nbsp;That's nothing! (throws a ball of lightning) Lightning Attack!</p>
<p>The two balls of fire and lightning collides and cancels each other out.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; (lands) Wow… You're pretty strong.</p>
<p class="txt">SOU:&emsp;&nbsp;Of course! Who do you think I am?!</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; All right…! I'm serious from now!</p>
<p class="txt">SOU:&emsp;&nbsp;Me too!</p><br>
<p>The cloud of KOR laughs proudly.</p>
<p class="txt">KOR:&emsp;&ensp;Even Inuyasha is helpless against my arrows!</p>
<p>The arrow in INU's chest dissipates. KAG runs and kneels next to INU.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Inuyasha! Are you all right?</p>
<p>INU sits up, and looks shocked.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;You're okay?</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Okay? They were just tricks…</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;What?!</p>
<p class="txt">KOR:&emsp;&ensp;Can't be! (throws another arrow at INU)</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (catches the arrow casually) You can touch them. Poke yourself.</p>
<p>KAG takes the arrow apprehensively and pokes her hand slightly. She lets out a sigh of relief and smiles. The arrow disappears.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Oh, you're right. Say, this may work on shoulder aches.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; I know!</p>
<p class="txt">KOR:&emsp;&ensp;W-What…!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (looks up at KOR and scoffs) What a waste of my time!</p>
<p>INU leaps towards KOR, who shrieks.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (threateningly) You'll change if you're hit 3 times, right?</p>
<p class="txt">KOR:&emsp;&ensp;(in mock surprise) Really?</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Don't act innocent! (thumps the cloud three times violently)</p>
<p>KOR transforms back to his normal state, with three bumps on his head, and falls to the ground.</p>
<p class="txt">KOR:&emsp;&ensp;How cruel!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (lands and grabs KOR) Now take us to this Souten!</p><br>
<p>SHI and SOU sprint towards each other. They collide mid-air. They both land coolly with their backs facing each other. Cut to close up of a cool looking SHI with a ball-toy in his hand. His sleeve suddenly tears a little.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; Not bad.</p>
<p>Cut to close up of SOU holding a drum toy. A piece of metal falls off the armour on SOU's shoulder.</p>
<p class="txt">SOU:&emsp;&nbsp;You, too.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; (turns around and throws three tops at SOU) Fox magic! Smashing top!</p>
<p class="txt">SOU:&emsp;&nbsp;(hammers darumas in SHI's direction) Thunder magic! Falling daruma!</p>
<p>The darumas collide into the tops and cancels each other out, changing back to toys.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; (throws a bunch of crying mushrooms) Take my screaming mushrooms!</p>
<p class="txt">SOU:&emsp;&nbsp;(throws a bunch of laughing acorns) Then try my laughing acorns!</p>
<p>SOU and SHI continue throwing acorns and mushrooms at each other, until they are both buried. They both fall back in exhaustion.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; H-Hey Souten… Isn't it about time you give up?</p>
<p class="txt">KOR:&emsp;&ensp;Shut up! What about you? Are the crayons dearer than your life?!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (in background) Shippo!</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; (sits up and the acorns disappears) Inuyasha! You're alive!</p>
<p class="txt">SOU:&emsp;&nbsp;(sits up and the mushrooms disappears) Inuyasha! (notices KOR in INU's hand and yells) Koryu! Did you fail?!</p>
<p class="txt">KOR:&emsp;&ensp;Forgive me, Lord Souten.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (in disbelief, points a finger at SOU) Hey, wait! Is he the one…?!</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; Yeah! This is Souten, the one who sent me the challenge!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;So cute! (runs to SOU)</p>
<p class="txt">SOU:&emsp;&nbsp;(shocked) What?!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(picks up SOU and hugs) Good boy!</p>
<p class="txt">SOU:&emsp;&nbsp;I'm not a kid! I'm the leader of the Raiju Tribe!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Yes, yes! (rubs SOU's forehead)</p>
<p class="txt">SOU:&emsp;&nbsp;(struggling) Don't touch my forehead!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (scoffs) We've been running around because of this kid?!</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; (scoffs and folds his arms) I told you I didn't need any help!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;How old are you, little boy?</p>
<p class="txt">SOU:&emsp;&nbsp;Don't insult me! I'm not a boy! I'm a girl!</p>
<p>SHI is taken aback and freezes momentarily.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(gushing) You're a girl? You're even cuter! (rubs her cheeks with SOU's)</p>
<p class="txt">SOU:&emsp;&nbsp;Don't touch my forehead!</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; G-Girl?! She's a girl?! (stands disinterestedly) This is so stupid. I'm going home. (walks)</p>
<p class="txt">SOU:&emsp;&nbsp;Hey wait! Shippo, are you running away?!</p>
<p>SHI continues walking, with his back facing SOU, and doesn't reply.</p>
<p class="txt">SOU:&emsp;&nbsp;Does that mean you admit your loss?</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; (stops) Yeah… (takes out the box of crayons and throws it to SOU) Here, you can have it.</p>
<p>SOU catches the box of crayons. She looks at it and then at SHI, and blushes. SHI has his side profile turned to SOU, and looks rather cool and mature.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; Be a good girl. Don't even think about vengeance anymore.</p>
<p>SHI droops his head and walks off. KAG and SOU look on.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; (narrating) And so, my battle to the death ended.</p>
<p>Cut to close up of SOU looking at SHI in awe and blushing.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; (narrating) I succeeded in defying fate and a vendetta.</p>
<p>Cut to MIR and SAN climbing out of the pit using a vine. KIR is helping out. INU, SHI and KAG walk towards them.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; (narrating) And those two, Souten and Koryu, learned a lesson and will never challenge me to a duel again.</p>
<p class="txtb">[ End of ACT II: 21min 23sec ]</p><br>
<p class="txtb">[ ACT III ]<a name="_ACT_III_"></a></p>
<p>Daytime. SOU is lying in a field, drawing with the crayons happily. She is humming. She picks up and drawing and giggles to herself, blushing. It is a drawing of a handsome and older version of SHI.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; (narrating) With this experience, I grew even more mature.</p><br>
<p>Cut to SHI standing in a field. The wind is blowing and he looks forward in a determined expression.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; (narrating) However, there are still many enemies waiting for me. I must not stand idle or look back. Yes, that is the path of a warrior like me, whose destiny is to fight.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Quit putting on an act! (appears behind SHI and thumps him on the head)</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; (crying and whining) Kagome! Inuyasha is picking on me!</p>
<p>Pan upwards to the sunny sky.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(threatening, in slow mode) I-nu-yasha!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Wait! Kagome!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Sit!!</p>
<p>A loud crash is heard.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; Good for him!</p>
<p class="txtb">[ End of ACT III: 22min 9sec ]</p><br>
<p class="txtb">[ End of episode 68: Shippo Receives an Angry Challenge ]</p><br>
<p class="quote"></p>
<p class="txtb">[ Preview for next episode ]</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Damn! Who is that guy?</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Sorry, Inuyasha! After I told everyone about you, they misunderstand you even more!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; It's no time to care about that! Another detachment of Naraku's has appeared!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;But, he isn't exactly a demon. They just say that you seem like the unruly sort…</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; That guy is a vicious killer, and took the faces of a lot of people! Next on Inuyasha, &quot;<a href="ep69.htm">Terror of the Faceless Man</a>&quot;. What does unruly mean?</p><br>
