<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(narrating) Sesshomaru, being a full-fledged demon, sees Inuyasha as a disgrace to his family because he's a half-demon. Inuyasha and Sesshomaru's father was a legendary dog demon.</p>

<p>Daytime by a beach, near a village INU-gang is gazing at the sea, when INU is lying lazily on a trunk on the sand.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;The ocean makes me feel so good.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Keh! I don't like this salty smell.</p>

<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(stretches) I should have brought my bathing suit!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (complaining) Hey, we are not here for a vacation.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;What's wrong with taking a break sometimes?</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Sometimes? You are always resting.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(glares) What do you mean by that?</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;(appeasing) Kagome, do you feel any Sacred Jewel fragment around here?</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(takes a moment) Not at all.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; I don't feel any evil spirits or demonic aura either. This place must be very peaceful.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;That's why we can all take a break here! (picks up a stick and waves it at INU)  Here, Inuyasha… (throws stick) fetch!!</p>
<p>INU sits up excitedly and runs after the stick. He is about to pick it up when he realizes what's going on.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Don't… (swing around and yells) Don't treat me like a dog!</p>
<br>
<p>Cut to a nunnery in the village. There is a statue of the Goddess of Mercy. A sickly young woman lies in a bed, surrounded by crying nuns.</p>
<p class="txt">Nun 1:&nbsp; What a shame, Your Highness…</p>
<p class="txt">Princess: I am not a princess anymore. Sara is just fine.</p>
<p class="txt">Nun 2:&nbsp; But Your Highness, if the Asano Castle hadn't burnt down…</p>
<p class="txt">Nun 1:&nbsp; If not for your sickness, you wouldn't be in a place like this.</p>
<p class="txt">Nun 3:&nbsp; I can't help feeling sad for you.</p>
<p class="txt">Sara:&ensp;&nbsp; This is what they call destiny. I have given you so much trouble.</p>
<p class="txt">Nun 1:&nbsp; Why do you say that, Your Highness?</p>
<p class="txt">Nun 2:&nbsp; We are all happy that we could take care of you, Your Highness.</p>
<p class="txt">Sara:&ensp;&nbsp; I am a very lucky person… to be surrounded by all of you and the villagers. I want them to hear my flute… for one last time…</p>
<br>
<p>Cut to outside nunnery. The sound of flute is heard, and villages gather outside the nunnery. INU-gang happens to walk past and is surprised to see the crowd. Cut to Sara looking shocked when INU-gang walks past outside. KAG stops to listen, engrossed in the music.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Hey, let's go.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Wait for me, Inuyasha. (catches up)</p>
<br>
<p>Cut to inside of house. Sara drops her flute, shaken.</p>
<p class="txt">Nun 2:&nbsp; Princess Sara? Princess Sara?</p>
<p class="txt">Sara:&ensp;&nbsp; (gasping) There is one thing… left unfinished in this world.</p>
<br>
<p>Cut to INU-gang almost out of the village. MIR and KAG stop walking.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;What's wrong, Priest?</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;What is that?</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Do you feel that too, Kagome?</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Yes.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; What's up with you two?</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;There is a large number of evil spirits gathering together.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Evil spirits?</p>
<p>Cute KIR growls. Pink aura starts to gather around the nunnery in the village.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Such a gathering… could it be…</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; Is it Naraku?</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; It is true that evil spirits are gathering… but this isn't Naraku.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;There are no Jewel fragments either. But…</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; It doesn't matter to us. Let's go.</p>
<p>Suddenly the nunnery catches fire.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Isn't that the nunnery?</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Something must have happened… Let's go!</p>
<p>MIR and KAG run towards the village.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; This is so troublesome.</p>
<br>
<p>Cut to INU-gang arriving outside the burning nunnery. The villagers are gathered outside, holding up their hands in prayer.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; What happened?</p>
<p class="txt">Villager 1: Right when Princess Sara passed away, a bright light…</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Princess Sara?</p>
<p class="txt">Villager 1: She was a nun who lived here.</p>
<p class="txt">Villager 2: She cared for the villagers and was well respected.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Miroku, about the bright light…</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Yes. It might have something to do with the gathering of evil spirits.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;It seems like there are no more evil spirits left.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Yes, I don't feel it now.</p>
<br>
<p>Cut to awhile later. The nunnery have been burnt to the ground. The nuns are kneeling next to a spot in the charred remains, crying.</p>
<p class="txt">Nun 1:&nbsp; Princess Sara… Princess Sara…</p>
<p class="txt">Nun 2:&nbsp; Her body… her body…</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; Look, Kagome! There is a shape of human left on the futon!</p>
<p>Amidst the burnt remains, there is a human-shaped spot which was untouched.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;You are right. It's not burnt at all.</p>
<p class="txt">Nun 3:&nbsp; Princess Sara's body was lying there. Her body disappeared along with the bright light.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(thinking) Disappeared? What does that mean?</p>
<br>
<p>Evening, SES-gang is walking through a valley.</p>
<p class="txt">Rin:&emsp;&emsp;Hey Grandpa Jaken, let's play the "Say it fast" game!</p>
<p class="txt">JAK:&emsp;&ensp; What?</p>
<p class="txt">Rin:&emsp;&emsp;Here we go… Red-Jaken, Blue-Jaken, Yellow-Jaken!</p>
<p class="txt">JAK:&emsp;&ensp; Red-Jaken, Blue-Jaken, Yellow-Jaken!</p>
<p class="txt">Rin:&emsp;&emsp;Grandpa Jaken, you're good at this! Once more! Red-Jaken, Blue-Jaken, Yellow-Jaken!</p>
<p class="txt">JAK:&emsp;&ensp; No more.</p>
<p class="txt">Rin:&emsp;&emsp;Why? Say it!</p>
<p>JAK groans and ignores Rin. He looks depressed.</p>
<p class="txt">JAK:&emsp;&ensp; (thinking) Lord Sesshomaru is going after Naraku but who knows where he is. How long are we going to go on with this…?!</p>
<p>SES suddenly stops and JAK bumps into him.</p>
<p class="txt">Rin:&emsp;&emsp;Lord Sesshomaru, what's wrong?</p>
<p>Up ahead in the mist, the sound of flute is heard. It is Sara, who is walking towards SES while playing the flute.</p>
<p class="txt">Sara:&ensp;&nbsp; (kneels) It's been a long time, Lord Sesshomaru.</p>
<p class="txt">JAK:&emsp;&ensp; Who are you? How do you know Lord Sesshomaru?</p>
<p class="txt">Sara:&ensp;&nbsp; Greetings, it is Sara.</p>
<p class="txt">JAK:&emsp;&ensp; Who?</p>
<p class="txt">Sara:&ensp;&nbsp; Have you forgotten what happened at Asano Castle?</p>
<p class="txt">SES:&emsp;&nbsp; Asano Castle?</p>

<p class="txt">Sara:&ensp;&nbsp; The first time Sara saw you… when Asano Castle was going through a difficult time.</p>
<p><span class="txtb">CUT TO FLASHBACK. </span>Nighttime in the land in front of a castle, bodies of soldiers are strewn all around. Cut to courtyard of castle. A general kneels in front of the lord of the castle, Asano Souju.</p>
<p class="txt">General: Your Highness! The enemy seems to be planning a final attack tonight!</p>
<p class="txt">Asano Souju: (stands) We've been trapped in the castle for a month. Food is scarce and the soldiers are weak. All we can do now is to abandon the castle.</p>
<br>
<p>The lord walks into the castle, into a room where his subjects are.</p>
<p class="txt">Asano Souju: Everyone, listen carefully! We will set the castle on fire and force our way out!</p>
<p class="txt">Subject 1: How can we…?</p>
<p class="txt">Subject 2: (kowtows) I want to fight till the end!</p>
<p class="txt">Asano Souju: No, do not fight back! Stay alive, no matter what happens!</p>
<br>
<p>Cut to SES, alone, walking through the enemy camp outside the castle. He kills the soldiers who try to block his way effortlessly with his whip.</p>
<br>
<p>Cut to the general running hurriedly into the room.</p>
<p class="txt">General: Your Highness! Your Highness!</p>
<p class="txt">Asano Souju: What is it? What happened?</p>
<p class="txt">Subject 3: Someone seems to have entered the enemy's base!</p>
<p class="txt">Asano Souju: What…?</p>
<br>
<p>Cut to SES in the enemy base.</p>
<p class="txt">Soldier 1: (frightened) Who are you?!</p>
<p class="txt">SES:&emsp;&nbsp; Move.</p>
<p class="txt">Soldier 1: Don't joke around!</p>
<p>The solder raises his sword to attack SES, but SES just cut the blade and the soldier with one blow.</p>
<br>
<p>Cut to Asano Souju witnessing the scene from a window.</p>
<p class="txt">Asano Souju: Is it a miracle? The help of god?</p>
<p class="txt">Sara:&ensp;&nbsp; Father!</p>
<p class="txt">Asano Souju: Sara, look at that man. He entered the enemy base alone and is defeating everyone.</p>
<br>
<p>Cut to SES killing the enemy soldiers. He notices Sara looking at him from the window. Sara gasps.</p>
<br>
<p class="txtb">BACK TO PRESENT.</p>
<p class="txt">Sara:&ensp;&nbsp; Lord Sesshomaru.</p>
<p class="txt">SES:&emsp;&nbsp; I do not know you.</p>
<p>SES walks past Sara.</p>
<p class="txt">Sara:&ensp;&nbsp; Please wait. I want to make your wish come true.</p>
<p class="txt">SES:&emsp;&nbsp; (stops) You say… my wish?</p>
<p class="txt">Sara:&ensp;&nbsp; Yes. And when I have succeeded, I hope you will accept me…</p>
<p class="txt">JAK:&emsp;&ensp; (furious) Stop being so stupid! Do you really think you can grant his wish?</p>
<p class="txt">SES:&emsp;&nbsp; Jaken…</p>
<p class="txt">JAK:&emsp;&ensp; Huh?</p>
<p class="txt">SES:&emsp;&nbsp; Step aside…</p>
<p class="txt">JAK:&emsp;&ensp; (frightened) Got it…</p>
<p class="txt">Sara:&ensp;&nbsp; I certainly will, Lord Sesshomaru!</p>
<p>SES scoffs and turns away.</p>
<p class="txt">SES:&emsp;&nbsp; Do as you wish.</p>
<p class="txt">Sara:&ensp;&nbsp; Yes.</p>
<p>Sara walks away, past JAK, Rin and A-Un, in a determined manner.</p>
<p class="txt">JAK:&emsp;&ensp; What? Who is she? Lord Sesshomaru, who is she?</p>
<p class="txt">Rin:&emsp;&emsp;She is so pretty.</p>
<p class="txt">JAK:&emsp;&ensp; It's the make-up. What can a human do?</p>
<p class="txt">SES:&emsp;&nbsp; Are you blind?</p>
<p class="txt">JAK:&emsp;&ensp; Huh?</p>
<p class="txt">SES:&emsp;&nbsp; She is not human.</p>
<p class="txt">JAK:&emsp;&ensp; (shocked) What? You're kidding!</p>
<p class="txt">SES:&emsp;&nbsp; She is a demon… or if she was originally a human, she is a low-class demon now.</p>
<p class="txt">JAK:&emsp;&ensp; This is so complicated!</p>

<p>Nighttime. INU-gang is walking along the beach in the village.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;I wonder why the nunnery exploded like that.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (not interested) I don't know.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; When many evil spirits gather, I've heard that it will cause an explosion like that. But I wonder how Princess Sara's body could have disappeared like that. I wonder what kind of connection there is.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;I have a bad feeling about this.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Even if that is the case, it doesn't matter to us. It is wise not to participate in this.</p>
<p>Suddenly the sea becomes rough and a demon bursts out of the surface and dives back in.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; What?</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; What is that?</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; A whale?</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;No, a monster.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Look, Inuyasha!</p>
<p>Where KAG is pointing to, a young woman who looks like Sara is tied up onto a stack on a cliff.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Who is that woman?</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; It seems like the monster is aiming for that woman.</p>

<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; (runs hurriedly) I will rescue you, Lady!</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;(shocked) Hey, Priest Miroku!</p>
<p>KIR transforms and SAN leaps onto her. MIR is running desperately along the beach, trying to overtake the water monster.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;It's too obvious, Priest…</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (exasperated) I don't have enough lives to be around you all!</p>

<p>The water demon is approaching the cliff.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Priest, get on!</p>
<p>MIR leaps onto KIR and they fly towards the monster.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Hiraikotsu!</p>
<p>SAN throws HIR which skims across the water and hits the water monster.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; (awed) Nothing less from Sango!</p>
<p>HIR returns to SAN. KIR lands on the cliff, near the lady, and MIR and SAN get off. The water monster continue swimming towards the cliff.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Sango, protect the lady. I will defeat him using my Wind Tunnel!</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Got it.</p>
<p>MIR is about open his Wind Tunnel, when SAN's cry is heard and a bright light is seen.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Sango!</p>
<p>MIR turns to look at SAN, and is shocked. Cut to INU leaping up the cliff. SAN and SHI get off. They are shocked.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Miroku! Sango!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;What is this?</p>
<p>SAN, MIR and KIR have been frozen into ice sculptures, and they were looking at the lady on the stake.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(disbelief) What happened?!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; What exactly happened?</p>
<p class="txt">Lady:&ensp;&nbsp; It is the wrath of the god of sea…</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;The god of sea?</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; That monster?</p>
<p>SHI climbs up SAN and listens to her chest.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; Their hearts are still beating. They're still alive!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;What can we do to help them?</p>
<p>The lady shakes her head sadly.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; That is obvious, we can just defeat that monster!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;The god of sea?</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; What?! It doesn't matter!</p>
<p class="txt">Lady:&ensp;&nbsp; It's coming!</p>
<p>The water monster reaches the cliff and growl. It is a crudely formed monster with red eyes.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Keh! What a sea god! (unsheathes TET) Wind Scar!</p>
<p>INU throws a Wind Scar which slashes the water monster into two. Seaweed fall out of the monster.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (shocked) This is… seaweed?</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; Inuyasha! It's no use, they won't turn back to normal!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Oh no!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; What's happening? Why aren't they transforming?</p>
<p>The lady looks down sadly. Cut to close-up of a blue necklace on her neck, which looks similar to Sara's.</p>
<br>
<p>Awhile later. The lady has been released from the stake. INU, SHI and KAG are looking at their frozen comrades.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;It's like glass.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; The kimono and Hiraikotsu are solidified too.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; What's happening? Why aren't they transforming?</p>
<p class="txt">Lady:&ensp;&nbsp; (sad) Probably because the curse of the sea god isn't gone. I should thank you for saving me but…</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Eh?</p>
<p class="txt">Lady:&ensp;&nbsp; Maybe I shouldn't have been saved.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Well… why are you here at such a place?</p>
<p class="txt">Lady:&ensp;&nbsp; I will tell you the details later. The tide will come in soon, it's dangerous to stay… We need to get them out of here quickly!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Yes, you're right.</p>
<p class="txt">Lady:&ensp;&nbsp; You can carry them to my village…</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Yes. Leave it to me.</p>
<br>
<p>The lady and INU-gang walk towards the village.</p>
<p class="txt">Lady:&ensp;&nbsp; My name is Umineko.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Why were you tied up over there?</p>
<p class="txt">Umineko: I was a sacrifice to the god of sea.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;A sacrifice?!</p>
<p class="txt">Umineko: Yes… The ocean here gets very rough once in every four years. In my village, it is our custom to offer human sacrifices to the sea god.</p>
<p>They reach the village. The villagers are all frozen in a running position, with shocked expressions, like MIR, SAN and KIR.</p>
<p class="txt">Umineko: My worst fears have come true…</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;It is because we defeated the god of sea?</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; It is not us… I am the one who defeated him… I should be the only one cursed!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Is there a way to turn them back?</p>
<p class="txt">Umineko: It might be possible… if we destroy the sea god's shrine.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;The sea god's shrine?</p>
<p class="txt">Umineko: Yes.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Okay, take us there immediately.</p>
<p class="txt">Umineko: Yes.</p>
<p>SHI looks at the frozen sculptures of MIR and SAN, and frowns in suspicion.</p>
<br>
<p>Cut to KAG, SHI and INU following Umineko up a cliff.</p>
<p class="txt">Umineko: There used to be a feudal lord by the name of Asano. And he has this magnificent castle on the cliffs. That is the shrine.</p>
<p>They reach an opening in a cave wall. A gate is built in front of it, and on the cave wall, there is a round mound. A long thin vertical crack is seen in the centre of the mound.</p>
<p class="txt">Umineko: There is a legend that the shrine will crumble and sink below the sea… if anyone manages to turn this crack horizontally.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Then it should be destroyed in no time.</p>
<p class="txt">Umineko: The villagers have tried before. But even with the power of 5 men, it didn't budge.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (cracks knuckles and scoffs) Let's try this.</p>
<p>INU tries to turn the round mound.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Inuyasha! Do your best!</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; It's not moving.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; This…!!</p>
<p class="txt">Umineko: Why don't you use some kind of tool instead of bare hands?</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; A tool?</p>
<p class="txt">Umineko: (looks at TET) Yes, like the sword you have.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Good idea.</p>
<p>INU takes out TET and place it in the crack. It fits perfectly. INU then grabs the sheath to use it as a lever to turn the mound. He struggles for awhile and the mound starts to move gradually.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;It's moving!</p>
<p>Umineko smirks. SHI gasps and looks at her in suspicion.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; This might work!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Do your best, Inuyasha!</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; (whispers) Kagome, there is something suspicious about this girl. Remember how Miroku and Sango were standing. They were all looking in her direction.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;You are right…</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; If they were cursed by the sea god, shouldn't they be looking at the ocean?</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;True…</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; Also, she was smiling when Inuyasha started to turn the rock. This may be a trick.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;It can't be…</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; Maybe the very person who transformed Miroku and the others was her!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Is that possible?</p>
<p>INU continues to turn the mound. Umineko is engrossed with INU and continues smirking. KAG gasps.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Wait, Inuyasha!</p>
<p>INU lets out a yell as the crack is horizontal. He turns to the rest, proud.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; I did it!</p>
<p>Suddenly static surges from the mound and pushes INU back.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; What?!</p>
<p>The mound starts to retreat into the cave.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; No!!</p>
<p>The cave ceiling starts to crumble and fall. INU grabs SHI and KAG, and leaps out of the cave just before some rocks fall on them. Umineko doesn't move.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Umineko!</p>
<p>Suddenly a large boulder falls onto Umineko and breaks her shoulder. Seaweed bursts out from the 'wound'.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;S… seaweed?!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; What the…!</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; It's the same as the sea god!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;A puppet…! Both Umineko and the sea god were puppets!</p>
<p>More rocks start to fall. INU grabs KAG and SHI and leaps up onto the top of the cliff.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Shit! What is going on?</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Inuyasha, where's your Tetsusaiga?</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Inside the shrine!</p>
<p>The cliff starts to crumble and a huge black raven with red eyes bursts out, carrying Umineko. She has TET in her hands. She takes off her kimono, to reveal a battle-like gown. It is Sara.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; What?!</p>
<p>Sara holds up TET and laughs.</p>
<p><span class="txtb">CUT TO FLASHBACK. </span>SES, injured by INU in the fight in episode 7, is resting under a tree in the forest. He is furious.</p>
<p class="txt">SES:&emsp;&nbsp; That Inuyasha… Tetsusaiga… Give me the Tetsusaiga!</p>
<p>Sara peeps at him from behind a tree.</p>
<p class="txtb">BACK TO PRESENT.</p>
<p class="txt">Sara:&ensp;&nbsp; Inuyasha, I have your Tetsusaiga. (laughs)</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;She stole the Tetsusaiga!</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; She was after Tetsusaiga!</p>
<p>INU growls. A gust of wind starts to blow.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;What is it now?!</p>
<p>SES appears a distance away from them.</p>
<p class="txt">Sara:&ensp;&nbsp; Lord Sesshomaru… Why are you here?</p>
<p>SES looks at Sara in silence.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; So you're behind all this, Sesshomaru!! (sprints towards SES) Iron Reaver, Soul Stealer!</p>
<p>SES merely zooms up and grabs INU's wrist. He releases a poison, burning INU's wrist. INU winces in pain. The raven, with Sara on it, flies towards SES.</p>
<p class="txt">Sara:&ensp;&nbsp; Lord Sesshomaru. Don't let him go!</p>
<p>SES flings INU aside and turns, sending a poison mist at the raven. The raven is completely disintegrated. Sara lands in front of SES.</p>
<p class="txt">Sara:&ensp;&nbsp; Lord Sesshomaru…</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; You…</p>
<p class="txt">SES:&emsp;&nbsp; Stop barking, Inuyasha.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; What?!</p>
<p class="txt">SES:&emsp;&nbsp; This has nothing to do with you.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; That girl, she is not on Sesshomaru's side?</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Yes… it seems so.</p>
<p class="txt">Sara:&ensp;&nbsp; (kneels and holds up TET) Please accept this… Please turn Inuyasha into dust with your Tetsusaiga.</p>
<p class="txt">SES:&emsp;&nbsp; Do not misunderstand.</p>
<p>Sara, taken aback, looks up at SES.</p>
<p class="txt">SES:&emsp;&nbsp; Did you really think that this is my desire?</p>
<p class="txt">Sara:&ensp;&nbsp; Are you saying that it is not…?</p>
<p class="txt">SES:&emsp;&nbsp; I do not need your help to defeat Inuyasha. (turns and walks off)</p>
<p class="txt">Sara:&ensp;&nbsp; Please wait, Lord Sesshomaru!</p>
<p>SES turns into a light orb and flies off.</p>
<p class="txt">Sara:&ensp;&nbsp; (sad) Lord Sesshomaru…</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Damn it! Give me back the Tetsusaiga!</p>
<p>Sara holds up her necklace and turns INU gradually into glass.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Inuyasha!</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; You'll turn into glass!</p>
<p>KAG fires an arrow at the necklace hurriedly, shattering it into pieces. Sara is shocked. INU reverts back to normal.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Why you…!</p>
<p>Sara's eyes glow in red and she holds up her palms.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (leaps) Iron Reaver…</p>
<p>Sara sends two dark aura from her palms at INU, throwing him back. INU crashes onto the ground and lets out a yell. KAG and SHI run to INU hurriedly.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Inuyasha!! Inuyasha!</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; Are you alright, Inuyasha?</p>
<p>Sara is gone.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Damn! I won't let her get away!</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; Are you going after her?</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Of course. You two go see how Miroku and Sango are doing!</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; Oh yes! If Inuyasha turned back, then Miroku and the villagers must have turned back too!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Inuyasha, will you be alright alone?</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Of course! I will definitely get my Tetsusaiga back!</p>
<p>INU sprints away.</p>

<p>SES lands in a dense forest near the village. He walks towards a large tree slowly.</p>

<p><span class="txtb">CUT TO FLASHBACK </span>from episode 7, when SES transformed into a full dog demon.</p>
<p class="txt">SES:&emsp;&nbsp; I wonder if you, a half-demon, can wield the Tetsusaiga! I, Sesshomaru, will watch to see if that is possible!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Now!</p>
<p>INU leaps with the transformed TET and slashes SES's left arm. SES growls in pain. INU then slashes SES across the chest. SES falls downwards, far away from the armor of INU's father. SES starts to glow and curl up, transforming into a white glowing orb and flies into the distance.</p>
<br>
<p>Nighttime in a field of soldiers in front of the Asano Castle. SES lands, clutching onto his blood-stained arm.</p>
<p class="txt">Soldier 1: What?!</p>
<p class="txt">Soldier 2: A ghost?</p>
<p class="txt">SES:&emsp;&nbsp; You are all an eyesore. Get out of here.</p>
<p class="txt">Soldier 3: What… what did you say?!</p>
<p class="txt">Soldier 1: He has an injured arm!</p>
<p class="txt">Soldier 4: No need to bother. Get him before we attack Asano Souju!</p>
<p>The soldiers raise their weapons and rush at SES. SES takes out his poison whip and slays the soldiers effortlessly.</p>
<p class="txt">SES:&emsp;&nbsp; (scoffs) Those bugs…</p>
<p class="txt">Soldier 5: (frightened) Who… What are you?!</p>
<p class="txt">SES:&emsp;&nbsp; Move.</p>
<p class="txt">Soldier 5: Don't joke around!</p>
<p>The solder raises his sword to attack SES, but SES just cut the blade and the soldier with one blow. SES walks away slowly.</p>
<br>
<p>Daytime. SES is resting under the large tree in the forest, with his eyes closed.</p>
<p class="txt">SES:&emsp;&nbsp; That Inuyasha…</p>
<p>Sara is walking in the forest, with her flute, and chances upon SES. She gasps. SES doesn't notice.</p>
<p class="txt">SES:&emsp;&nbsp; Tetsusaiga… Give me the Tetsusaiga.</p>
<p class="txt">JAK:&emsp;&ensp; (background) Lord Sesshomaru! I've been looking for you!! Lord Sesshomaru!</p>

<p>Cut to Sara playing her flute.</p>

<p class="txt">General: Yes, he hasn't moved.</p>

<p class="txt">Sara:&ensp;&nbsp; Please wait, Father! Isn't Lord Sesshomaru the benefactor of Asano Castle?</p>
<p class="txt">Asano Souju: Move away, Sara!</p>

<p class="txt">Sara:&ensp;&nbsp; Lord Sesshomaru!</p>

<p class="txt">Sara:&ensp;&nbsp; But I do not resent you, Lord Sesshomaru. I'm to blame for my father's insanity. After that, I became a nun. There I was praying for the souls of my father and the people of the castle. Call it retribution or bad karma… I contracted a serious illness thereafter… and I found out that I didn't have much time left. Harboring my feelings for you, Sesshomaru, I was going to say farewell to my life.</p>
<p><span class="txtb">CUT TO FLASHBACK</span> from earlier in the episode, when Sara was playing her flute in the nunnery in the village, just as INU-gang walk by.</p>
<p class="txt">Sara:&ensp;&nbsp; (voice-over) But… that was when I saw Inuyasha! Upon seeing Inuyasha, I changed my mind…</p>
<p class="txtb">BACK TO PRESENT.</p>

<p><span class="txtb">CUT TO FLASHBACK.</span> The nuns are crying as Sara lay on her bed weakly. Suddenly a lot of demons appear and fly around the room.</p>
<p class="txt">Sara:&ensp;&nbsp; (voice-over) Numerous demons appeared before me.</p>
<p>Sara remains expressionless as the demons fly around her menacingly.</p>
<p class="txt">Sara:&ensp;&nbsp; (thinking) They must be invisible to the others.</p>
<p>A demon with a large purple head flies close to Sara's face.</p>
<p class="txt">Demon: Sara… I can grant your wish! As long as you grant us your spiritual powers, as long as you surrender your body, you will be able to kill Inuyasha and have the Tetsusaiga!</p>
<p>Sara gasps.</p>
<p class="txt">Demon: What do you think, Sara? Don't you want to tell Sesshomaru how you feel?</p>
<p class="txt">Sara:&ensp;&nbsp; (weakly) Lord Sesshomaru… My beautiful Lord Sesshomaru!</p>
<p>Sara closes her eyes and the demon enters into her body.</p>
<p class="txt">Sara:&ensp;&nbsp; (voice-over) There was no hesitation. And the demons took over me. No, I should say I gladly gave my body to the demons.</p>
<p>Suddenly Sara glows with a pink aura and the nuns are terrified. More demons enter Sara's body, like Onigumo. Cut to exterior view of the burning nunnery. Sara is standing on the giant raven, looking at the village.</p>
<p class="txt">Sara:&ensp;&nbsp; (voice-over) With my spiritual powers strengthened, and my body and soul free, I was reborn…</p>
<br>
<p>BACK TO PRESENT. Sara keeps her flute and a red glow appears in her eyes. She takes TET and looks at SES.</p>
<p class="txt">Sara:&ensp;&nbsp; Lord Sesshomaru… Won't you accept what I've done for you?</p>
<p>SES, who have never once looked at Sara, finally looks at her and scoffs.</p>
<p class="txt">SES:&emsp;&nbsp; So that is your true form.</p>
<p class="txt">Sara:&ensp;&nbsp; My true form? What are you talking about, Lord Sesshomaru?</p>
<p>SES looks at Sara in silence. Suddenly, INU leaps out.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; I've finally found you!</p>
<p class="txt">Sara:&ensp;&nbsp; (smirks) Inuyasha, right?</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Iron Reaver, Soul Stealer!</p>
<p>INU is about to claw Sara when SES spins around and whips INU across the shoulder. INU jumps backwards and grabs his shoulder in pain.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; I should have known…! You are part of this, Sesshomaru?!</p>
<p class="txt">SES:&emsp;&nbsp; Do not even try to touch her.</p>
<p>Sara smiles and INU growls.</p>
<p class="txt">SES:&emsp;&nbsp; This does not concern you.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; I don't think so! I need to get back my Tetsusaiga! Blades of Blood!</p>
<p>INU digs into his wound and throws Blades of Blood at SES, who blocks with his sword. A Blade of Blood skips off SES's sword and hits Sara in the shoulder. Demons burst out of her wound and seizes INU.</p>
<p class="txt">Sara:&ensp;&nbsp; Damned Inuyasha… You deserve to die…</p>
<p>SES steps in front of INU and looks at Sara.</p>
<p class="txt">Sara:&ensp;&nbsp; (taken aback) What?</p>
<p class="txt">SES:&emsp;&nbsp; Do not show Sesshomaru your ugly self any further. (raises sword)</p>
<p class="txt">Sara:&ensp;&nbsp; Lord Sesshomaru…!</p>

<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;There he is!! There is Inuyasha!</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Go down there, Kirara!</p>

<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; Is Sesshomaru and that girl!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;What is happening?</p>
<br>
<p>Back in the forest. SES slashes Sara into half with Tokijin. Demons then bursts out of her body and rush at SES. Sara's face changes into that of a demon.</p>
<p class="txt">Sara-Demon: Sesshomaru! You actually knew who we really are!!</p>
<p class="txt">SES:&emsp;&nbsp; You thought I wouldn't?</p>
<p class="txt">Sara-Demon: Nothing less from Sesshomaru… That's right… Sara was just bait. Our real target was you, Sesshomaru! If we killed Inuyasha and got his Tetsusaiga, you would definitely appear! It seems that our predictions were all correct!</p>
<p>Demons continue rushing out of Sara's body. KIR lands and SAN and MIR get off.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; There are so many demons!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Inuyasha!</p>

<p>SAN swings HIR, slaying the demons which were binding INU. The rest of the demons, however, have gathered in a gigantic mass in the sky and are about to rush at him.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Inuyasha, get down! Wind Tunnel!</p>
<p>MIR opens his Wind Tunnel and sucks in the demons. Sara-Demon is losing his footing from the vacuum caused.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Miroku! Don't suck in the Tetsusaiga!</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; I know!</p>
<p>MIR sucks in most of the demons and closes his Wind Tunnel. INU glares at Sara-Demon, who holds TET.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Damn it…</p>
<p>KAG gasps as she notices the flute in Sara-Demon's clothes.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Wait Inuyasha! That flute…</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; What about it?</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;It is the flute that the nun had at the nunnery!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (furious) What are you trying to say?!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;He might be that nun we saw earlier!</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; And she's now a demon?</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Then it must mean that the demons have taken over the nun!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;That's probably right!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Keh! Well then, the only way is to defeat it!</p>
<p>More demons rush out of Sara-Demon.</p>
<p class="txt">Sara-Demon: (laughs) This woman's spiritual powers are now ours! And if we take your demon powers, we will be the ultimate demon then!</p>
<p class="txt">SES:&emsp;&nbsp; Humph. You scum.</p>
<p>The image of Sara appears across Sara-Demon's chest.</p>
<p class="txt">Sara:&ensp;&nbsp; Lord Sesshomaru… Please forgive me.</p>
<p class="txt">SES:&emsp;&nbsp; (thinking) They haven't completely taken over her yet.</p>
<p class="txt">Sara-Demon: Shut up. You are already a part of us. Soon you will lose your consciousness and eventually you won't be able to move or die.</p>
<p class="txt">Sara:&ensp;&nbsp; (tearing) I have given you so much trouble… I'm so weak, Lord Sesshomaru.</p>
<p class="txt">Sara-Demon: I told you to shut up!</p>
<p class="txt">Sara:&ensp;&nbsp; Lord Sesshomaru… if you can…</p>
<p>KAG gasps. SES slays a couple of demons rushing at him.</p>
<p class="txt">Sara:&ensp;&nbsp; If you can… please kill me together with the demon…!</p>
<p>Without missing a beat, SES slashes Sara-Demon across the chest with Tokijin. More demons rush out.</p>
<p class="txt">Sara-Demon: It's no use! The blade is full of anger and hatred… Since we love evil blood, it is the best feast ever! You can try with all your might, but you cannot defeat us!</p>
<p>SES slashes Sara-Demon's arm and TET flings out of its hand, landing near SES. KAG aims an arrow at Sara-Demon and INU notices.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Kagome!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;I want to try!! I want to save her! I might be able to purify the demon! Hit it!</p>
<p>KAG fires and the arrow hits Sara-Demon in the chest. Sara-Demon yells in pain but more demons rush out from the chest wound.</p>
<p class="txt">Sara-Demon: Wretched girl!!</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; Kagome!! The number of demons have increased!</p>
<p>A demon rush at KAG and INU claws it just in time.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Crap!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;I'm sorry!! (thinking) But if it keeps on like this… she will…</p>
<p class="txt">SES:&emsp;&nbsp; If Tokijin can't be used…</p>
<p>SES sheathes Tokijin and walks towards TET. He holds TET and static surges out, burning his hand.</p>
<p class="txt">SES:&emsp;&nbsp; This is the only way…</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Tetsusaiga!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Sesshomaru is going to use Tetsusaiga?!</p>
<p class="txt">SES:&emsp;&nbsp; (thinking) The sword that can swipe out 100 demons in a swing, Tetsusaiga. Lend me your powers!</p>
<p>SES draws TET out of its sheath and it transforms. He then swings a Wind Scar at the horde of demons rushing at him. The Wind Scar reaches Sara-Demon.</p>
<p class="txt">Sara-Demon: It can't be!</p>
<p>Sara-Demon is blown into smithereens. A long trail of lava remains in the wake of SES's Wind Scar. SES throws TET away and it lands near INU.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Tetsusaiga!</p>
<p>SES looks at his palm, which was burnt from TET's barrier.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (grabs TET happily) I've got you, Tetsusaiga! I'll show you the power of my Tetsusaiga!</p>
<p>INU looks at another horde of demons rushing at them. KAG draws an arrow determinedly.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (shocked) Kagome?!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Go! (fires) Hurry, use your Wind Scar!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; O-ok! Wind… Scar!!</p>
<p>INU throws a Wind Scar with was amplified by KAG's sacred arrow. All the demons are finally destroyed. SES walks to Sara who is lying under the large tree, melting away.</p>
<p class="txt">Sara:&ensp;&nbsp; I am finally free… Lord Sesshomaru… Thank you so much…</p>
<p>SES kneels and picks up Sara's flute.</p>
<p class="txt">Sara:&ensp;&nbsp; I have no regrets… (crying) Because… I can finally tell you… how I feel…</p>
<p>Sara completely disintegrates into a pile of ash. SES looks at it for a moment and sticks the flute into the ash pile. He stands and walks away.</p>
<p class="txt">SES:&emsp;&nbsp; (thinking) Keep playing your flute in the world above…</p>
<p>INU-gang walks to the pile of ash and watches as SES walks away.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Why… She was so pitiful…</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Yes…</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; (kneels and prays) No, this must have been the best way.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; (prays) Will she be redeemed?</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Perhaps so… I can tell by her peaceful face.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Sesshomaru… saved her.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Keh! Sesshomaru wouldn't do that. (keeps TET) He comes and goes like the wind… Let's go.</p>
<p>INU turns around. The rest looks at the pile of ash and flute sadly as the wind starts to blow the ash away.</p>
<br>
<p>Evening in a valley. Rin is lying on A-Un, humming to herself and playing with a branch of flower. She is humming the song she sang in episode 77 about waiting for SES. JAK is circling the ground, worried.</p>
<p class="txt">JAK:&emsp;&ensp; I wonder where he is… Where is he…?</p>
<p>SES appears and walks towards the group.</p>
<p class="txt">Rin:&emsp;&emsp;Lord Sesshomaru!</p>
<p class="txt">JAK:&emsp;&ensp; Where were you, Lord Sesshomaru?</p>
<p class="txt">SES:&emsp;&nbsp; (walks past JAK) Nowhere.</p>
<p class="txt">JAK:&emsp;&ensp; (disappointed) Nowhere? But Lord Sessho-na-maru-na…</p>
<p>A-Un gets up as SES walks past him.</p>
<p class="txt">SES:&emsp;&nbsp; Let's go.</p>
<p class="txt">Rin:&emsp;&emsp;Yes!</p>
<p class="txt">JAK:&emsp;&ensp; I'm sorry, Lord Sesshomaru…!</p>
<p>Pans upwards to evening sky. JAK tries to sing Rin's song about SES.</p>
<p class="txt">JAK:&emsp;&ensp; Sesshomaru sama do…</p>
<p>A loud thump is heard and JAK's cry of pain is heard.</p>

<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; What did you say, Haachi? Monk Mushin is dying?!</p>
<p class="txt">HAA:&emsp;&ensp;Yes, I'm sorry but I saw…</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Monk Mushin? Isn't he the one who raised you, Priest?</p>
