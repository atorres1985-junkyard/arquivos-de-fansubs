<p>Flashback from previous episodes.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(narrating) Naraku is about to complete the Sacred Jewel. We are on a journey to retrieve the remaining fragments.</p>
<p>Cut to episode 85 when INU-gang first met the weird old exorcist who couldn't sense evil aura.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(narrating) I can't believe we'll meet that person again on our journey…!</p>
<p class="txt">Exorcist: (spraying purifying salt) Demon, be gone!</p>
<br>
<p>Nighttime. INU-gang is barbequing tiny fishes over a campfire in a forest.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;This is sort of a simple dinner.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (irritated) That's all the fishes we could get!</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; Kagome, there is no more ninja food left, right?</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Nope.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; Miroku, why didn't you buy any food?</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; (frowns) I don't have money to buy the food.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(shocked) There is no money left?</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Nope… We need to start earning some!</p>
<p>SHI's stomach growls loudly, and everyone looks at him. INU's stomach starts to growl too and he looks away in indignation.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;It's almost done.</p>
<p>SAN picks up two sticks of fish over the fire and hands one to KIR, who mews cheerfully.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; That's great…</p>
<p>MIR and KAG each pick up a stick of fish too. SHI is pleasantly surprised when he notices a stick with two fishes instead of one. He is about to reach for it when INU notices it too and reaches in. There is a moment of tension between SHI and INU, with both of them placing their hands near the stick.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; I'm bigger, so I need more food!</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; (clenches fists) I'm growing, so I need the food!</p>
<p>INU seizes the chance when SHI's clenching his fists to grab the stick.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (smug) Got it!</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; It's mine!</p>
<p>SHI jumps to grab the fish from INU, but INU punches him to the ground. SHI struggles up in pain and fury.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; You thought you could win? (shakes fish jeeringly) Impossible!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Inuyasha.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Huh?</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Sit!</p>
<p>INU crashes to the ground and the stick of fishes fall out of his hand.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; (leaps) It's mine!</p>
<p>SHI is about to grab the stick when INU slaps his head from behind and takes it instead.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; No…! (finishes the fish happily) Thanks for the food!</p>
<p>SHI sits up and wails loudly. KAG hands another stick of fish to SHI.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;You'll be able to eat as much as you want tomorrow.</p>
<p>SHI nods and looks at KAG with tears in his eyes. Cut to SHI a short distance away from the group. He leaps onto a boulder and eats his fish.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; (thinking) Inuyasha, you idiot! I will seek revenge for stealing my food!</p>
<p>SHI turns back and glares at INU.</p>

<p>Nighttime in a large mansion in a town. The old lord of the mansion and his servants bow to the Exorcist.</p>

<p class="ttable">Exorcist abbreviated as EXO from now onwards.</p>

<p class="txt">EXO:&emsp;&ensp;Are you sure? It's just the wind!</p>

<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; That's true.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (runs back to the group) Then what are we going to do?!</p>

<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; A strange technique?</p>
<p class="txt">EXO:&emsp;&ensp;It still gets in even when the house is secured. One can feel its presence, but can't see nothing. That means the culprit can walk through walls and turn invisible.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Must be a ninja!</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;That's impossible, even for a ninja!</p>

<p>KIR mews and follows SAN out of the room.</p>

<p>Cut to busy town square. In an alley, two boys are teasing a girl, tossing her bean bag to each other.</p>
<p class="txt">Boy 1:&nbsp; Here here!</p>

<p>SAN walks towards the boys, and as she's invisible, it seems like KIR is floating towards them.</p>
<p class="txt">Boys:&emsp;(terrified) A cat demon!!</p>
<p>The boys throw away the bean bag and run for their lives, yelling. KIR leaps off SAN and picks up the bean bag. She hands it to the invisible SAN, who hands it to the girl.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Here! Bye!</p>
<p>Suddenly, the Universe of Clouds spell loses its power, and SAN is gradually visible again. The girl smiles and waves to SAN as she walks away.</p>
<p class="txt">Girl:&emsp;&emsp;Thank you, Sister…</p>
<br>
<p>Cut to SAN walking in the town square. The town folk stares at SAN and wondering why she's walking with a talisman and leaf on her forehead. SAN, however, doesn't know she's visible again.</p>
<p class="txt">Woman 1: (background) Stop it, Priest!</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; (background) No, no… I'm serious!</p>

<p class="txt">Woman 2: Really?</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; (cheerful) Really!</p>
<p>MIR turns around and notices SAN, and looks shocked and guilty. SAN glares at him.</p>

<p class="txt">Woman 2: Say it, say it!</p>

<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; (uneasy) B-Because of the attractive hips. Right?</p>
<p>MIR reaches for Woman 1's butt and gets slapped on the hand.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Right?</p>
<p>MIR tries to reach for Woman 2's butt and gets slapped on the hand too.</p>
<p class="txt">Woman 2: You're kidding.</p>
<p class="txt">Woman 1: You're so bad, Priest.</p>
<p>MIR laughs uneasily and looks at SAN, who is walking slowly towards him.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; (thinking) It's strange… Normally, she would have violently attacked me by now. (worried, thinking) Why? Why doesn't she say anything? What does the talisman on her forehead mean? (fearful, thinking) Is it supposed to insinuate me?</p>
<p class="txt">Woman 1: (holding MIR's arm) Priest?</p>
<p class="txt">Woman 2: (holding MIR's other arm) Why did you stop talking suddenly?</p>

<p class="txt">Woman 1 & 2 sit MIR on a bench outside a shop. MIR is now facing SAN.</p>
<p class="txt">Woman 2: The food here is very nice…</p>
<p>SAN walks up to MIR, fuming but not saying a word. MIR can't stand it anymore and falls to his knees.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Please forgive me! Please scold me directly if you want to!</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;(shocked) Y-You can see me?</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; (pointing) And why is the talisman on your head? You're insinuating me, right? (whimpering)</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;(shocked) Erm… Priest… Can you see me?</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; What do you mean "can you see me", Sango?</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;(embarrassed) That's impossible! I…</p>
<p>SAN sobs and runs off hurriedly.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; (arms reaching out) Sango!</p>
<br>
<p>Cut to SHI running across the courtyard of the mansion where INU and KAG are at. The spell gradually loses its power and SHI is visible again, but he doesn't know. He opens the window to one of the huts. KAG is bathing inside. KAG notices SHI, who makes faces and sticks out his tongue at her. KAG wipes her face with a towel. SHI grins and runs off. KAG looks at the window again.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(bewildered) That was Shippo, right?</p>
<br>
<p>Cut to INU napping on the pavilion. SHI runs up to him quietly and drags the bowl of snacks under INU to himself. INU wakes and sees SHI eating the snacks happily. SHI finishes the snacks and INU gasps. SHI, thinking that INU can't see him, sticks two remaining dried fish up INU's nose. INU glares at SHI, who rolls on the ground, laughing quietly to himself. SHI is delirious.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (thinking) What's wrong with him?</p>
<p>SHI sniggers and leaps. He kicks INU on the forehead, leaving a paw print. INU doesn't move. SHI then runs and kicks INU in the face. INU is shocked. SHI lands and giggles quietly to himself. INU's face twitches in anger. SHI then runs back a few steps and runs forward, leaping high up to kick INU's face. INU slaps SHI, sending him flying into the pond in the courtyard.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Shippo! You seem to be enjoying yourself! (cracks knuckles)</p>
<p class="txt">SHI shivers in fear. The talisman and leaf fall off his forehead. SHI grabs the two and runs off, shrieking in fear. KAG walks up to INU.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; That Shippo…! I wonder what's wrong with him! How dare he kicked me for no reason.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;It means that both of you are good friends.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; How?!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;You and Shippo fight a lot because you two are friends… but you should hold back more since he's younger than you.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; That doesn't matter to me! Keh!</p>
<br>
<p>Cut to SHI back in the mansion with EXO. SHI looks at the talisman and the leaf on the floor.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; I was careless. Inuyasha has a good sense of smell… so he must have sniffed me out…</p>
<p class="txt">EXO:&emsp;&ensp;Perhaps the invisible demon doesn't have a good sense of smell.</p>
<p>SAN enters the room.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Erm… Shippo…</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; Yes, Sango?</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;N-Nothing…</p>
<p class="txt">EXO:&emsp;&ensp;It's almost sunset. I was asked to protect the treasures and scrolls of this house.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; Scrolls?</p>
<p class="txt">EXO:&emsp;&ensp;Yes, the invisible demon steals scrolls and rolls of kimono fabric.</p>
<p>SAN looks down worriedly.</p>
<br>
<p>Nighttime. Cut to MIR, KAG and INU walking into the treasure room of the mansion they are guarding.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Okay! Well, we have eaten!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;And we have bathed!</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; All we have to do now is wait for the thief to arrive.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Will it come?</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; What if it doesn't work?</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; I'm not sure.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Are we going to guard the house without sleep?</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; You can go and rest in the next room, Kagome.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;I'll stay awake for as long as I can.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; It might not come here anyway.</p>
<br>
<p>Cut to EXO and SAN patrolling the courtyard of the other mansion.</p>
<p class="txt">EXO:&emsp;&ensp;I wonder which house it will go to.</p>
<p>Something moves past them in the background. SAN swings around.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Did you feel something?</p>
<p class="txt">EXO:&emsp;&ensp;Nothing…</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;(chagrins, thinking) I forgot that she's like this… (speaking) Anyway, where is Shippo?</p>
<p class="txt">EXO:&emsp;&ensp;He made himself invisible and is waiting in the room.</p>
<p>SAN gasps.</p>
<p class="txt">EXO:&emsp;&ensp;Even if the demon arrives, he'll be safe by his invisible mode. (walks away)</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;(looks to the treasure room, worried) Shippo!</p>
<br>
<p>Cut to treasure room, where SHI is guarding alone. SHI is seated in the middle of the room, with the talisman and leaf on his forehead. Suddenly the lamp in the room goes out. SHI starts to perspire worriedly, but tries to upkeep his composure. Suddenly a paper thin man slithers through the gap of the door sideways and flies into the room. He sucks in a lot of air and begins to fatten himself out. He notices the scroll of painting on the wall. Ignoring SHI, he floats towards the painting and rubs his cheeks against it affectionately. SHI starts kicking his butt. The thief ignores SHI as he is almost ten times bigger then him. The thief then gathers a bunch of scrolls and is about to walk off. SHI leaps to kick him, but the thief merely slaps him. SHI is sent crashing through the door. The thief walks out clumsily with the scrolls.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; Oh no, the scrolls… Fox Fire!</p>
<p>SHI leaps and throws a fox fire at the thief, which pops into a puff of smoke. The thief groans. The puff of smoke dissipates to reveal multiple SHI, who are each taking a scroll away from the thief.</p>
<p class="txt">Thief:&emsp;Who are you?</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; You can see me? (takes down the talisman and leaf) That's too bad…</p>
<p>The rest of the Shippos throw smoke bombs and disappear. SHI leaps and lands a distance away.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; Sango! Old hag!</p>
<br>
<p>Cut to SAN and EXO, who hear SHI's cry and run towards the treasure room. KIR, however, doesn't follow them, but changes into her fierce form and flies off.</p>
<br>
<p>Cut to SHI grabbing two scrolls and running away from the thief. The floating thief lands in front of SHI and opens his mouth wide at SHI. SHI is horrified and yells. Suddenly, HIR flies out and hits the thief, who falls to the ground. SAN and EXO arrive at the scene.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;How did he manage to get inside?</p>
<p class="txt">EXO:&emsp;&ensp;He is not invisible either!</p>
<p>The thief struggles up and blows out air. As he blows, he gets thinner and flatter, till he is paper thin.</p>
<p class="txt">Thief:&emsp;Give it to me… Give me the treasures.</p>
<p>When the thief is seen sideway, the paper-thin nature of his body makes him invisible.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;He disappeared!</p>
<p class="txt">EXO:&emsp;&ensp;As I thought, an invisible demon!</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; H-He is not invisible!</p>
<p class="txt">Thief:&emsp;(flies next to SHI) Give it to me…</p>
<p>SHI gasps and backs away in horror.</p>
<p class="txt">EXO:&emsp;&ensp;Demon! Where are you? (throws purifying salt around) Accursed demon! Where are you?</p>
<p>The thief continues to chase SHI.</p>
<p class="txt">Thief:&emsp;Give me the treasures…</p>
<p class="txt">EXO:&emsp;&ensp;Where are you? Are you here?</p>
<p>INU suddenly appears and grabs SHI. He lands on a branch in a tree.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Why are you running?</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; Inuyasha!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; You seem to be protecting the treasures well. (looks to the ground) Let's see…</p>
<p>The paper-thin thief is floating below. When seen from the front, the thief is visible. But when seen from the side, he becomes 'invisible'.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; (pointing) Inuyasha!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (jumps down and lands in front of thief) I found you.</p>
<p>The thief floats away from INU. INU leaps and lands in front of him, blocking his way. The thief whimpers and is about to float away but INU grabs his legs.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; I won't let you go!</p>
<p class="txt">Thief:&emsp;W-Why?</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; You have an unfamiliar smell!</p>
<p>KIR lands with MIR and KAG.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Inuyasha!</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Inuyasha!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; The mission is complete. What should we do with him?</p>
<p class="txt">Thief:&emsp;Please forgive me…!</p>
<p class="txt">EXO:&emsp;&ensp;I think… he should return all the treasures he has stolen!</p>
<p class="txtb">[ End of ACT II: 21min 23sec ]</p>
<br>
<p class="txtb"><a name="AIII"></a>[ ACT III ]</p>
<p>Dawn. INU-gang, EXO and the thief are in a cave in a mountain. INU and SHI are sitting at the cave entrance. The rest are with the fattened thief, who gasps at the large mass of his loot.</p>
<p class="txt">Thief:&emsp;I like these kind of things so I collect them!</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;So many!</p>
<p class="txt">EXO:&emsp;&ensp;Do you want to split them?</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;We should give them back to the owners!</p>
<p class="txt">EXO:&emsp;&ensp;Well, we'll still get some rewards…</p>
<br>
<p>Cut to outside of cave, where SHI and INU are.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; (disappointed) I thought I could use my magic…</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; You have the new demonic magic?!</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; (takes out a lollipop from KAG's bag) But, you saved me in the end… I'll try again next time. (eats lollipop)</p>
<p>INU scoffs and looks away.</p>
<br>
<p>Awhile later. EXO and INU-gang are bidding farewell to the thief.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Leave the place soon since you have learned the lesson.</p>
<p class="txt">Thief:&emsp;Yes. Goodbye…</p>
<p>The thief blows air out and flattens himself. He then floats away.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(awed) It's so thin…!</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;That's why it seemed like he was invisible.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; I thought I could see a real invisible demon…</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Stop being so stupid, Shippo.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; What do you mean stupid?</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; An invisible demon cannot be seen!</p>
<p class="txt">All:	(awed) That's true!</p>
<p>Everyone looks at the thief floating away.</p>
