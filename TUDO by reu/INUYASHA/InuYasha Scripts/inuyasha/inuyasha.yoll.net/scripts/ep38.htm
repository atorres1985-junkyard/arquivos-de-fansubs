<p class="txtb"><a name="_ACT_I_"></a>[ ACT I ]</p>
<p>Morning in present-day Japan. KAG, Sota (KAG’s kid brother Sota), GRA (KAG’s grandpa) and her mom are eating together. KAG is in a bad mood.</p>
<p class="txt">Sota:&emsp;Sis, please pass the soy sauce.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(sternly) Stand up, then reach out and get it yourself.</p>
<p class="txt">Sota:&emsp;Err… I guess I don’t need soy sauce today.</p>
<p class="txt">GRA:&emsp; (sternly) What’s with this prickly mood in here? Kagome, I don’t know what happened over there but it’s been so long since we sat down to breakfast together. So why don’t you cheer up and smile up, (waves bowl and chopsticks around happily) and talk up a storm?</p>
<p class="txt">Sota:&emsp;(horrified, stuttering) Gramps…wrong move.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(slams bowl down and stands up suddenly) Excuse me!</p>
<p>KAG picks up her cutlery and utensils and walks away from the table. Sota and him sighs and bows head in unison.</p>
<p class="txt">GRA:&emsp; Mama, what’s the matter with that girl?</p>
<p class="txt">Mama: (drinks tea) I wouldn’t worry. (holds out tea cup) See…an upright tea stem!</p>

<p>Exterior of KAG’s school.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(walking) It seems so long since I came to school.</p>
<p>KAG’s friends appear behind KAG and runs up to her, calling out her name.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(turns around) Oh! Yuka, Eri, Ayumi! Good morning!</p>
<p class="txt">Eri:&emsp;&emsp;  How can you be so carefree?</p>
<p class="txt">Yuka:&emsp;There’s big trouble!</p>
<p class="txt">Ayumi: While you were absent from school with your economy-class syndrome…</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(slouches over, to herself) Whatever is this “such-and-such syndrome”?! (thinking) Gramps made up another new illness for me!</p><br>
<p>At the bicycle shed in school. Hojo is locking up his bicycle. A girl with big curls and a wide-eyed look jogs towards Hojo excitedly, with a tennis racket in her arms.</p>
<p class="txt">7th Grade Girl: Hojo!</p>
<p class="txt">Hojo:&emsp;(raises his arm) Hi!</p>
<p class="txt">Yuka:&emsp;You see! She’s only a seventh-grader! She’s been following Hojo around lately. And it doesn’t seem as though Hojo minds the attention.</p>
<p>Cut to KAG, Eri, Yuka and Ayumi peeping at Hojo and the seventh grader behind a bush.</p>
<p class="txt">Eri:&emsp;&emsp; What’ll you do, Kagome?</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Why? Nothing wrong with that.</p>
<p class="txt">Eri:&emsp;&emsp; Hey!</p>
<p class="txt">Ayumi: If you ignore her, she’ll steal him away!</p>
<p class="txt">Yuka:&emsp;(sternly) Your rival is a seventh-grader! Her skin is peachy smooth! Dreamy Hojo is easy prey for someone like her!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;But… it’s not like I’m going steady with Hojo.</p>
<p class="txt">Yuka:&emsp;(eyes KAG suspiciously) Kagome… are you…</p>
<p class="txt">Yuka &amp; Eri: (catches up with KAG who has walked off) I knew it! You are seeing someone else!</p>
<p class="txt">Eri:&emsp;&emsp; I’m sure of it!</p>
<p class="txt">Yuka:&emsp;That’s the only reason you can be so nonchalant!</p>
<p class="txt">Eri:&emsp;&emsp; So who is it?</p>
<p class="txt">Yuka:&emsp;Who?</p>
<p class="txt">Yuka &amp; Eri: (stern) Confess!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(mad) Oh, stop! I don’t even want to think about that guy!</p>
<p class="txt">Ayumi: There is someone!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;That’s why…! (saved by the bell) Class is starting! I have to hurry! (runs off)</p>
<p class="txt">Yuka &amp; Eri: (follow) Kagome, wait!</p>
<p class="txt">Ayumi: Hey, wait!</p>
<p>Cut to exterior of school.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(thinking) Oh boy… This is awful!</p>
<p><span class="txtb">Flashback </span>of previous episode, when INU asked what happened between KAG and KOG.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(the background turns into pretty shades, sweetly) Inuyasha! (background turns into fiery orange, yells furiously) Just what are you suspecting me of?! Is that how you’ve been seeing me?!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (taken aback by this outburst and yells loudly back) W-what’re you scolding me for?!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(clenched teeth and yells louder) Because you’ve totally misunderstood!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (clenched teeth and yells back) Shaddup! I don’t wanna see your face anymore! Just go away!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(sternly) I see! Sango!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (scoffs and squints sideways at KAG) Hah! Planning to go to Koga?</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(really really mad) I’m going back home! Stupid! Stupid! (KAG’s voice resounds through the forest)</p><br>
<p><span class="txtb">Back to present.</span> Daytime in the Feudal era, at the Dry Well. SHI and SAN looks into the well.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Hmm…it looks like an ordinary old well. But this connects to Kagome’s world?</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; But the only ones able to cross through the well are Kagome and Inuyasha. Inuyasha’s the only one who can go get Kagome…yet that stubborn dolt! (pissed) Acting so proud! He’s holding it all up!</p><br>
<p>Cut to INU sneezing. He is sitting on a fence in the fields in KAE's village. KAE is sorting some herbs.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (looks around) Damn! Someone out there’s bad-mouthing me!</p>
<p class="txt">KAE:&emsp;&ensp;Inuyasha, of course, people will criticize you. Since you’ve done something really stupid.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; What?! Hey, old hag! What’s stupid about me?!</p>
<p class="txt">KAE:&emsp;&ensp;Stupid is as stupid does! To find the Sacred Jewel fragments, Kagome’s spiritual power is essential. Yet you got her upset and sent her running home.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Shaddup! She chose to go home herself! (makes a girly gesture and tries to mimic KAG’s voice) She said, “I’m going back home, stupid!”</p>
<p class="txt">KAE:&emsp;&ensp;(serious) Inuyasha…</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; What?!</p>
<p class="txt">KAE:&emsp;&ensp;(deadpan tone) Even your imitation of her is stupid.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (falls off the fence) So what?! (indignant)</p><br>
<p>Cut to village square. A line of village girls forms a queue in front of MIR, who is sitting on a rock. They look excited.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; All right, please line up. Oh…this is a fine palm. You’ll live a long life and have many children.</p>
<p class="txt">Woman 1: Is that really true, Master Monk?</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; How about it? Won’t you have one of my children?</p>
<p class="txt">Woman 1: (blushes and slaps MIR’s hand affectionately) Oh, stop! Master Monk!</p>
<p class="txt">Woman 2: (walks up to them, blushing) You just asked me the same question earlier!</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; It’s something I ask every beautiful woman once. However, you seem to be willing. Now then…can I satisfy both of you at the same time?</p>
<p class="txt">Woman 2: Oh dear! Stop, Master Monk!</p>
<p>MIR chuckles merrily. SAN and SHI are behind him, looking on. </p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;What a lecher.</p><br>
<p>MIR, SAN and SHI walking. SHI is on SAN’s shoulder.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; I see… but it’s no use for us to get too worried. Until Inuyasha cools down, nothing will be solved.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; He’s such a fool! I’ve seen how headstrong Inuyasha can be.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; In any case, you two… Don’t go near the well.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; Why not?</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Think of Inuyasha’s personality. If someone is watching, he won’t go to get Kagome even if he wanted to. Underneath that exterior is a cute, gentle side of him. (walks on)</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;(pauses and looks at MIR, thinking) You can’t always tell a person by his looks.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; (thinking) And someone else here is a prime example.</p><br>
<p>Cut to INU running stealthily on the grass, near the dry well. He surveys the area and reaches the well.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Awright… No one’s looking. I can’t forgive that Kagome! No way! (jumps in) I’m gonna make her apologize!</p><br>
<p>KAG at Wacdonald’s with friends.</p>
<p class="txt">Yuka:&emsp;Now then, you’re not getting away today!</p>
<p class="txt">Eri:&emsp;&emsp; Kagome…what kind of guy are you seeing anyway?</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;So…it’s a stupid creep! He’s rough and moody and selfish! And he gets soooo jealous!</p>
<p class="txt">Ayumi: But getting jealous must mean he cares about you!</p>
<p class="txt">Yuka:&emsp;Oh, then everything’s going well with him. Geez, I thought it was going to be juicier than this.</p>
<p class="txt">Eri:&emsp;&emsp; So it’s okay then. He really cares only for you.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;I’d be happy if that were the case. But he hasn’t been able to forget the woman he loved long ago. (thinking) That’s right! Now that I think about it…Inuyasha still cares about Kikyo. So why does he always get jealous over me?</p>
<p class="txt">Ayumi: So Kagome, you’re being chased with wild passion!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(happily agrees) I know! He even tried to kill someone who approached me!</p>
<p class="txt">Eri:&emsp;&emsp; (stands up and slams the table in unison with Yuka) H-hey!</p>
<p class="txt">Yuka:&emsp;What’s with this guy?!</p>
<p class="txt">Eri:&emsp;&emsp; Why are you seeing a fellow like that?!</p>
<p class="txt">Yuka:&emsp;You must leave him! Don’t ever see him again!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Err… but…</p>
<p class="txt">Eri:&emsp;&emsp; Mean and selfish, right?</p>
<p class="txt">Yuka:&emsp;And he gets jealous, right?</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Yes… But he has good qualities. He can be very gentle… and he’s strong and reliable.</p>
<p class="txt">Eri:&emsp;&emsp; Kagome…</p>
<p class="txt">Yuka:&emsp;Do you…love this fellow?</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(thinking) Love? Inuyasha?</p>
<p class="txt">Ayumi: You must love this guy, Kagome. (smiles)</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(thinking) I… I… love Inuyasha?</p><br>
<p>At the Higurashi shrine. A black shadow sweeps out of the well. It leaps stealthily and swiftly across the courtyard to the house. It’s INU. Cut to INU leaping onto outside KAG’s room on the second floor. He opens the window.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (climbing in) What? She’s not here! (sniffs the air) This room… is filled with Kagome’s scent. (turns around and faces the window)</p>
<p class="txt">Sota:&emsp;(opens the door, holding a bag of potato chips) Oh! Inuyasha!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (cringes in terror and turns around) W-what?!</p>
<p class="txt">Sota:&emsp;Do you remember me? I’m Kagome’s kid brother, Sota. (INU calms down) Hey! Did you come to visit?</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (folds arms and murmurs) Well…yeah.</p>
<p class="txt">Sota:&emsp;I’m so glad. You didn’t have a fight then? Sis has been in such a bad mood!</p>
<p>INU squats dejectedly.</p>
<p class="txt">Sota:&emsp;What’s the matter?</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (thinking) So she’s still angry? Man, can she hold a grudge!</p><br>
<p>Cut to KAG walking slowly across the courtyard.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;I’m so tired.</p>
<p>Cut to KAG opening the door.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(listless) I’m home.</p>
<br>
<p>Cut to KAG’s room.</p>
<p class="txt">Sota:&emsp;It’s Sis! (yells) Sis! Inu--!</p>
<p>INU gasps in horror and places a hand over Sota’s mouth.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (grabbing Sota’s shirt and shaking him, fiercely) Listen! Do not tell Kagome that I came!</p>
<p class="txt">Sota:&emsp;(frightened) Uh-huh…!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (hops onto the window ledge) It’s a promise, man to man.</p>
<p class="txt">Sota:&emsp;A man-to-man promise? Awright! (nods determinedly)</p>
<p>INU leaps out of the window just as KAG enters the room. </p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Sota!</p>
<p class="txt">Sota:&emsp;Hello!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;What’re you doing in my room?!</p>
<p class="txt">Sota:&emsp;Oh…well… (jogs out of the room) It’s a man-to-man promise.</p>
<p>KAG looks that Sota, bewildered.</p><br>
<p>Nighttime, KAG is having a shower.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(sits into the tub, thinking) But now that I think about it, Inuyasha had come to save me that time. Yet I took Koga’s side. I guess I’m at fault.</p><br>
<p>In Feudal era, INU sits on the ground with his back on the well.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (indignant) Keh! That Kagome! I’ll never apologize! (squats with hands on the ground, in a childish tone) Damn! (kicks sand at the well) Stupid! (kicks some more sand like a dog…)</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; (peeping at INU behind a trunk with SAN) Why’d he go there anyway?!</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Such a troublesome guy.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN and SHI are shocked when they heard MIR's voice.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;(rushes with SAN to where MIR is) Hey, Miroku! You told us not to go near the well!</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; (holding up a large leaf over his head as camouflage) Oh no…these things can be quite entertaining.</p><br>
<p>Day time in present day Japan. KAG is in the classroom, putting down her bag.</p>
<p class="txt">Hojo:&emsp;Higurashi! (appearing by the classroom door) You’re in school! Are you feeling better?</p>
<p>Cut to Hojo and KAG talking in the corridor.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;A movie?</p>
<p class="txt">Hojo:&emsp;Yes. We haven’t seen each other lately.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(thinking) Oh shucks! I thought I should go over to the other time this weekend.</p>
<p class="txt">Hojo:&emsp;Is Saturday a bad day for you?</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Umm…</p>
<p class="txt">Eri:&emsp;&emsp; (appears suddenly with Yuka and grabs KAG’s arms, one on each side) She’s going, right Kagome?</p>
<p class="txt">Yuka:&emsp;(to Hojo) She wants to go.</p>
<p>KAG looks at them bewildered.</p>
<p class="txt">Hojo:&emsp;Really?</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(stuttering) Hey!</p>
<p class="txt">Hojo:&emsp;(waves while walking off) Then this coming Saturday, okay? (walks off)</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(shrugs off Eri and Yuka, pissed) Hey, why’d you do that?!</p>
<p class="txt">Yuka:&emsp;An average guy like Hojo is just right for you!</p>
<p class="txt">Eri:&emsp;&emsp; (fingers pointing) Yes! Someone stubborn and rough is not someone you should be seeing! Or your future will be ruined!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(thinking) Are they talking about Inuyasha?</p>
<p class="txt">Yuka:&emsp;Now get this! You’re going to the movie!</p>
<p>KAG says ‘umm’ in uncertainty.</p><br>
<p>Cut to Higurashi shrine. KAG opens door to the hidden well. She’s carrying the big yellow haversack she always carries when she goes over to the Feudal era.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(leaning on the well, thinking) Inuyasha is probably still mad at me. He’s the type to hold a grudge.</p>
<p>An image of INU appears, superimposed on the well.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; I never want to see you again! (the image fades away)</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(sighs, thinking) It’s no good. If I go back now, we’ll only fight. (walks away from the well)</p><br>
<p>Fade to Feudal era, INU is slouched over the well, looking in. An image of Sota appears over the well.</p>
<p class="txt">Sota:&emsp;Sis has been in such a bad mood…</p>
<p>INU sighs.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; (appears suddenly and yells) Inuyasha!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (shocked and tumbles over) Don’t pop out at me like that!</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; Just go and get her! Kagome will forgive you!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; What’re you saying?! You sound like it’s all my fault!</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; (slams palm on the edge of the well) It is you fault! Do you still suspect Kagome!?</p>
<p>INU is taken aback. <span class="txtb">Flashback</span> of previous episode where KOG lies in pain in KAG’s lap.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(angry) Settle it once and for all?! This is no time for that! Koga is hurt!</p>
<p><span class="txtb">End of flashback. </span>INU and SHI sit with folded arms by the well.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; (matter-of-factly) Kagome did indeed protect Koga and helped him escape. Koga is your enemy. And she was kidnapped by him and suffered! Yet she helped him! (opens eyes in wonder) That’s right, Kagome’s the one who suffered most at Koga’s hands. So why did she take his side? Inuyasha… Do you think that maybe Kagome really did fall in love with Koga?!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (twitches in anger) Don’t ask me! If you’re gonna try to reason with me, get your facts straight first! (stands up) Why don’t you go someplace far way?! (picks up SHI, swings him in circles and flings him far away)</p><br>
<p>INU walks along a path in the village, SHI following.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; (cajoling) Hey, Inuyasha, I was wrong earlier. And so—</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (turns around and waves a fist at SHI, yelling) Shaddup already! You’re so persistent! I will not go after her! And that’s that! (folds arms)</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; Just hear me out. These complicated things should be discussed with wise old Kaede who has lots of experience with life. That’s what I think.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (scoffs) Keh! None of your business! (walks on)</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; (following) Don’t worry. I won’t say your name. I’ll pretend it’s a friend of mine. Okay?</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (stops and turns around) Oh well…if that’s how you’ll do it…I don’t mind coming along.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; All right! Let’s go! (jumps up, grabs INU’s hand and runs)</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Just for a while. Got that!</p><br>
<p>In KAE’s hut. SHI and KAE are facing each other, while INU sits sideways behind SHI, pretending not to be interested.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; Actually… I want some advice about a dog friend of mine.</p>
<p class="txt">KAE:&emsp;&ensp;Dog?</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (defensively) Not me!</p>
<p class="txt">KAE:&emsp;&ensp;And? What of this dog friend of yours?</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; (serious) Well… This dog… (whispers to KAE while eyeing INU) likes this cat.</p>
<p>Cut to a box of crayons strewn on the ground. SHI holds up a cute drawing of mini versions of KOG (in a wolf suit), KAG (in a pink cat suit) and INU (blue hair in red dog suit)</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; But, a wolf appeared!</p>
<p>Zoom in to drawing. Mini-KOG is has heart-shaped eyes. Mini-KAG and INU (holding hands) look shocked.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; (voice-over) And fell in love at first sight with the cat.</p>
<p>Next drawing: Mini-INU and mini-KOG fighting, mini-KAG looks on, gasping.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; (voice-over) Naturally, the dog and wolf fought each time they met.</p>
<p>Next drawing: Mini-KOG runs away with mini-KOG in his arms, mini-INU runs after him like a dog, with red angry lines emitting from him.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; (voice-over) One day, the wolf stole the cat from under the dog.</p>
<p>Next drawing: Cute version of Bird Brothers trampling on mini-KOG (who is flat on the ground) Mini-KAG looks on in desperation.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; (voice-over) However, demons who hated the wolf appeared. And the wolf was hurt badly.</p>
<p>Next drawing: Mini-INU biting the cute Bird Brothers (who are crying). Mini KOG is still on the ground with swirls in his eyes.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; (voice-over) The dog who came to rescue the cat also defeated all the demons…</p>
<p>Next drawing: Mini-KOG hugs mini-KAG, who is feeling sorry for him. Mini-INU carries a plank in his arms, looking at mini-KOG threateningly.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; (voice-over) The dog wanted to punish the injured wolf, too…</p>
<p>Next drawing: Mini-KOG sprinting away like a wolf, mini-INU chases with smoke emitting out of him. Mini-KAG stands in front of INU, blocking him.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; (voice-over) but the cat protected the wolf and let it escape!</p>
<p>Next drawing: Mini-KAG and mini-INU glares at each other, sparks from each other’s eyes explodes in the middle of the drawing.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; (voice-over) The cat was only trying to help the injured wolf, but the dog suspected that the cat had feelings for the wolf!</p>
<p>Next drawing: Mini-KAG leaping into a well.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; (voice-over) So the cat got very angry and went back to her homeland.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; So that’s the story. How can we get the cat and dog to be friends again?</p>
<p class="txt">KAE:&emsp;&ensp;Hmm… First, the dog must acknowledge his mistake.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (shots up and yells) Why?!</p>
<p class="txt">KAE:&emsp;&ensp;Why are you so upset? Isn’t this about Shippo’s dog friend?</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (stuttering) Err… well… continue. (sits down)</p>
<p class="txt">KAE:&emsp;&ensp;Probably, the cat is longing for the dog to come get her. The dog and cat have misunderstood each other. That’s why nothing can be resolved. First, they have to see each other. Then they must talk it over well. That’s the fastest solution.</p>
<p>INU ponders and leaves the hut without saying a word. SHI and KAE grin at each other.</p><br>
<p>Nighttime in KAG’s room. KAG is doing her homework, Sota is playing with Buyo on her bed.</p>
<p class="txt">Sota:&emsp;Sis, how long are you going to stay?</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Why? Can’t I stay? I’m busy with my studies! I can’t always be going to the Feudal Era.</p>
<p class="txt">Sota:&emsp;But you always do.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;That’s because Inuyasha comes to get me.</p>
<p class="txt">Sota:&emsp;Maybe he won’t come anymore.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(pencil lead snaps upon hearing, turns back and yells) How can you say that?! Get out of here!</p>
<p class="txt">Sota:&emsp;(shocked and runs out of the room, Buyo clinging on him looking terrified) You’re always so angry, that’s why he won’t come! (slams door)</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Because I’m always angry… (ponders for away and goes to her bed, setting her alarm clock) I’ll just get up early and study. I can’t concentrate. (puts clock on nightstand and lies on her bed) The bedding feels so good! I can’t sleep like this over there. (thinking) I sort of can… Inuyasha watches over me. I wonder what’s he’s doing now. (falls asleep)</p>
<p>Fade to several hours later. INU opens the window and gets in softly, thinking)</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (looking at KAG) Shucks. She’s asleep.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(still asleep) Inuyasha…</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (thinking) She’s talking in her sleep. Is she dreaming about me?</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(turns over) Sit!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (falls flat faced onto the floor, gets up and waves a fist, thinking) This woman! What is she dreaming?!</p>
<p>The alarm clock rings, scaring the hell out of IN. He takes it, and tries biting and shaking it, to no avail.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Just remember this!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(reaches for alarm clock and wakes up) My alarm clock is gone. (realizes the window is open) Huh? (thinking) Could it have been Inuyasha…? (sees the footprints on the ground, thinking) He was here.</p><br>
<p>Daytime in KAG’s school. KAG is talking to Hojo in the locker room. </p>
<p class="txt">Hojo:&emsp;Something urgent came up?</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Err…so I won’t be able to go to the movies on Saturday. I’m sorry.</p>
<p class="txt">Hojo:&emsp;I see… (disappointed)</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;But really…don’t mind me. You can take that seventh grader. (upbeat) That girl… I think she likes you!</p>
<p class="txt">Hojo:&emsp;Higurashi! So silly! Is that what you’re worried about?</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Eh?</p>
<p class="txt">Hojo:&emsp;I don’t intend to see anyone else. I see… but I’m kinda happy. (background changes to rosy pink, Hojo looks happy) Higurashi, you were jealous, huh?</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(sweat-drop) Err… no…</p>
<p class="txt">Hojo:&emsp;(walking off) I’ll ask you again! Bye! (leaves the room)</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(thinking) Hojo, you’re so resilient! I wish Inuyasha had your confidence.</p><br>
<p>Feudal Era, INU sits on top of a grass hill, sighing. KAG walks up behind him.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; K-Kagome…</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;I came back. (puts down her haversack and sits next to INU, thinking) Inuyasha won’t apologize. If I say it first, then everything will be all right. (to INU nicely) Say, Inuyasha.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Sorry.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Eh?</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Why’re you looking like that? You’re still angry, right?</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Uh… no… not anymore! I’m sorta glad that you apologized so graciously.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (reaching into his clothes) Oh… you sure? (takes out KAG’s alarm clock)</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;You apologized about breaking this clock?</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (deadpan) What else is there to apologize for? (turns away)</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(gets up raising a fist) You are soo…!</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; (suddenly appears behind some tall grass with SAN and SHI) Kagome!</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; (leaping) Kagome!</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; (grabbing KAG’s arms with SAN, SHI grabbing her calf) Please calm down!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; W-what’re you doing?!</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; Inuyasha is truly repentant!</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;He went to get you twice. And since you left, all he’s done is sigh.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Two times?</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; ‘Nuff already! (gets up) And you guys! How do you know I went over there?!</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Well…</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Look… she came back. Just apologize nicely.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (makes exasperated, angry sounds and yells) Shaddup!</p>
<p>INU chases MIR, SAN and SHI, who let go of KAG and runs off, exiting the screen.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Stop! (chases them with outstretched claws)</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Forgive us, Inuyasha!</p>
<p>Group runs off screen, to the left. KAG remains where she is.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; No way! (chasing)</p>
<p>INU and the three enters the screen from the left, running towards the right.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; We were just worried about you! (four of them exits screen to the right)</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (four of them enters screen, running to the left) None of your business, stupid!</p>
<p>Four of them exit screen. Perspective changes to them running in the foreground.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; We were worried!</p>
<p class="txt">KAE:&emsp;&ensp;Forgive him. (appears next to KAG) He’s so excited. He’s happy that you’ve returned, Kagome.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (in the background) I’m not wrong!</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; This calls for Wind Tunnel!</p>
<p>Cut to the four of them running in the background.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Try to suck me in! (leaps into the air)</p>
