Although Naraku's fourth detachment, Juromaru, gives people an impression of being expressionless and eerie demon, but he is extremely fast! His speed makes it a difficult fight for Inuyasha. This Juromaru even has a brother, Kageromaru. These two are a pair of vicious siblings! But we have Miroku and Sango on our side, and even Koga rushed over to help us! We won't lose to them! Next episode, 'Juromaru and Kageromaru'!</p>
<p class="header"><a name="1"></a>'Adult Swim' Synopsis</p>
<p>Kagome senses a shard of the Shikon Jewel approaching. It is none other than Koga, who wants to know the location of Naraku's castle. When Inuyasha doesn't have the answer, Koga leaves and meets the demon Juromaru, who has another demon named Kageromaru living inside him. The gang must work together with Koga to defeat this new menace.</p>

<p>INU-gang is walking through a rocky path with flowers. Butterflies flutter around and tweeting of birds are heard in the background.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; It's so peaceful.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;I'll say… All the battles we go through seem like a dream. (gasps) Huh? I sense the Sacred Jewel.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; What?!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;And it's getting closer!</p>
<p>Something flashes by them and causes a torrent of wind. It stops in front of them, revealing KOG.</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; (raising a hand) Yo!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Koga!</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; (walks towards KAG) I caught your scent, Kagome, and came to see you. How've you been?</p>
<p>While KOG is walking towards KAG, INU moves in front of KAG, blocking his path.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Whaddya want, wolf cub?</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; Hah?!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Inuyasha, don't pick a fight.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Shaddup…depending on the way it goes, it'll kill ‘im!</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; Hah! You haven't changed a bit, mutt. (turns sideways and dig his ear with his pinky) Every time I see you, you're always so angry and arrogant. Kagome, don't you get tired with a guy like him?</p>
<p>SHI leaps onto INU's shoulder.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Hey…</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Why you…</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; (butting in) Hey, Koga! Don't be rude! Inuyasha is just nervous, thinking you'll steal Kagome away from him. (clenches a fist) If you think he's always like this, you're wrong—</p>
<p>INU thumps SHI on the head angrily.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(thinking) Shippo. Wrong thing to say.</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; You're really wound up tight, huh?</p><br>
<p class="txtb">[ Title screen: Juromaru and Kageromaru ]</p><br>
<p>A while later, INU-gang, KOG, HAK, GIN and a few wolves sit around.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Tell you where Naraku's castle is?! Stupid! If we knew that, we wouldn't be in this bind!</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; Don't you know then?</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (sighs) Naraku has a barrier around his castle. Why don't you let us avenge your comrades' deaths and hand over the Sacred Jewel fragments you have in both your legs (unsheathes TET) and just go back to your nest! (swings it downwards on KOG violently)</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; (leaps and lands) What's the matter, dogface? You seem awfully clumsy in handling your sword.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Damn!</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; The Tetsusaiga is still too heavy for him.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Well, it won't become light so quickly.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Don't run away!</p>
<p>KOG walks off, and the rest of his clique run off, in front of him.</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; Sorry, but I have no time to spar with you now.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (yells) Hey! Come back here!</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; (running) Dogface! I'll leave Kagome in your care until I kill that Naraku! Don't you dare lay one finger on her!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; W-what?!</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Even when he runs away, he's so confident.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(chiding) Inuyasha! Don't get so riled up.</p>
<p>INU glances sideways at KAG, his ears twitching.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (walks in front of KAG) When did I get riled up?!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(sighs and turns away, thinking) I'm happy that he's jealous but he could at least be a little more kind. (walks off, speaking in a bored tone) This is so tiring.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (taken aback and stutters) W-wha--! Does being with me really tire you out?</p>
<p>KAG makes a ‘Hmph?' sound. Cut to INU sitting on all fours on the ground, looking disenchanted.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(kneels next to INU) Why are you so depressed? (holds INU's arms) Don't worry about what Koga said.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; He's worried about what you said, Kagome.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;(nods) Uh-huh…</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Huh?</p><br>
<p class="txtb">[ End of ACT I: 2min 40sec ]</p><br>
<p class="txtb"><a name="_ACT_II_"></a>[ ACT II ]</p>
<p>Night time on a cliff. KOG and his clique notices NAR's poison insects flying towards them.</p>
<p class="txt">HAK:&emsp;&ensp;Huh? What's that?</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; Insects?</p>
<p>Cut to KOG sprinting down the cliff face, chasing the insects.</p>
<p class="txt">GIN:&emsp;&nbsp; K-Koga!</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; This is the smell! The same smell as Kagura! No mistake about it!</p><br>
<p>In a forest. NAR, in his baboon suit, rides on a skeletal horse. It is pulling a carriage with a cloth covering its contents. KOG reaches the scene.</p>
<p class="txt">NAR:&emsp;&ensp;(stops) Oh… (gets off the horse) The young leader of the Wolf-Demon Tribe. You followed my scent before Inuyasha could.</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; You…are Naraku?!</p>
<p><span class="txtb">Flashback </span>from episode 39, when KGR laid a trap for KOG and INU, and killed KOG's comrades.</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; (voice-over) The same smell as that woman Kagura. He must be Naraku! I'll never forget… the wrath of my comrades who were killed by you. I'll avenge them right here!</p>
<p class="txtb">Back to present. </p>
<p class="txt">NAR:&emsp;&ensp;(laughs) Too bad…but you can be fodder for my new incarnation.</p>
<p>The wind blows slightly, and the cloth over the carriage flutters a little, revealing a cage underneath. A glimpse of an eye can be seen before the cloth falls back into position.</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; A cage? Ha! I don't know what you hauled over but you couldn't have timed it better. I'll get revenge for my comrades!</p>
<p class="txt">NAR:&emsp;&ensp;(laughs) Koga…he will be your opponent. (pulls off the cloth on the cage) Come on out, Juromaru.</p>
<p class="ttable">* Juromaru abbreviated as JMR from now onwards *</p>
<p>JMR, a young man with pink hair walks out of the cage. He has shackles on his wrists and ankles. He looks up at KOG, revealing a mask over his lower face.</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; (gasps, thinking) W-what is he…? (to NAR) Humph, so be it! I'll take him first! I'll beat the hell out of both of you! Naraku, what's wrong? Hurry up and take off his shackles!</p>
<p class="txt">NAR:&emsp;&ensp;For you, he's fine just as he is.</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; Well then…here I come! (sprints towards JMR) Take that! (pivots himself with his hand on the ground and kick)</p>
<p>JMR dodges and grabs KOG's neck swiftly. He pushes KOG onto the ground. KOG kicks him off, and JMR loses his grip on KOG's neck. JMR lands a distance away, on all fours.</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; (gets up and breathes heavily) Why you…! (thinking) He's fast… I'm afraid he might be faster than I am. No…but what's this chill in the air? Huh? The bit in his mouth…</p>
<p>Some gas emits from the bit/mask over JMR's mouth. KOG glares uneasily at JMR.</p><br>
<p>Cut to INU sprinting in a forest. The group is lagging behind. SAN, SHI and KAG sit on KIR, while MIR runs.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; It's Naraku's smell!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Wait, Inuyasha!</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Don't go off on your own! Good grief! You can't even wield the Tetsusaiga sufficiently!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (sprinting, yells) Shaddup! (thinking) It's not only Naraku I smell! I catch the smell of that pesky Koga as well! (clutches TET) I'm the one who's gonna destroy Naraku! I won't let Koga get ahead of me!</p>
<p>KOG suddenly appears and sprints in front of INU.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Koga! What're you doing?!</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; Shaddup! I'm busy right now!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; What?!</p>
<p>JMR comes crashing through the trees behind KOG and INU.</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; He's caught up with me!</p>
<p>JMR catches up with INU and look sideways at him for a moment. He then claws at INU, who dodges.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (landing) Koga! You're running away!</p>
<p>KOG, in a mini whirlwind form, sprints into the bushes ahead and disappears.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Damn, he's gone!</p>
<p>JMR punches INU, who leaps away.</p>
<p class="txt">NAR:&emsp;&ensp;So you've finally come, Inuyasha. (fades in behind JMR)</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Naraku!</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; (reaching with the rest of the gang) Naraku!</p>
<p class="txt">NAR:&emsp;&ensp;Koga realized he couldn't win and ran off. He's smarter than I thought.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Keh! Don't put me in the same class as that cowardly wolf!</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; That is another one of Naraku's incarnations.</p>
<p class="txt">NAR:&emsp;&ensp;Juromaru, I'll remove your seal. Fight to your heart's content.</p>
<p>The bit on JMR's face shatters and falls off. The shackles around JMR's limbs also shatters. JMR, freed, suddenly turns back at slashes NAR, who breaks into two.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Huh?!</p>
<p class="txt">SAN &amp; MIR: Huh?</p>
<p>Around JMR's tiny mouth, gas emits and glows.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (shocked, thinking) Just what is he…?</p>
<p class="txt">NAR:&emsp;&ensp;(laughing) Once the bit is removed, Juromaru is unstoppable…until he kills every living thing around him.</p>
<p>The baboon suit glows in pink and disappears.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (thinking) W-what is this Juromaru? He gives me the creeps!</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; It's probably just a demon puppet, but he just slashed the head of Naraku who's supposed to be an ally.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Can't he tell the difference?</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;That's why he was shackled and bridled.</p>
<p>JMR attacks INU, who leaps and dodges. INU punches JMR in the face and JMR falls backwards. He doesn't move.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Why you--! (thinking) What's with him? He's taking my blows straight on. Is this a trap? (JMR gets up slowly) No… No matter how I look at it, he's not capable of thinking up sly tricks to fight. (flexes his claws) If that's the case, I'll just deliver a finishing blow! (leaps at JMR) Iron-Reaver, Soul-Stealer!</p>
<p>JMR blocks INU's attack with a flash of light.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; They're evenly matched!</p>
<p>A flash of light appears around JMR and punches INU.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Inuyasha!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (wipes his face, thinking) What was that just now?! He elongated his arms! He can transform his body?!</p><br>
<p>Under the cliff where the rest of the wolf pack was.</p>
<p class="txt">HAK:&emsp;&ensp;Did you find Naraku?</p>
<p class="txt">GIN:&emsp;&nbsp; Why did you return?</p>
<p class="txt">HAK:&emsp;&ensp;Or did you run away?</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; Just my instinct. Naraku is one thing but that thing he brought along looked so dumb. I got a really bad feeling about him. I trust my instincts. Hah! But that Inuyasha is so stupid. He's probably being beaten to a pulp by that Juromaru.</p>
<p class="txt">HAK:&emsp;&ensp;You saw Inuyasha?</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; Well yeah…</p>
<p>HAK and GIN look at each other, then at KOG.</p>
<p class="txt">HAK:&emsp;&ensp;Umm…Koga…we may be out of line about this…</p>
<p class="txt">GIN:&emsp;&nbsp; But doesn't it mean that Kagome who's with Inuyasha is in danger?</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; (gasps) Huh?! (punches them violently) Stupid! Why didn't you say so earlier?! (sprints off)</p>
<p class="txt">HAK &amp; GIN: (with bumps over their faces, yelling) You should've realized it yourself!!</p><br>
<p>Back with INU in the forest. JMR is attacking INU. A flash of light appears around JMR and attacks INU.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Why you…! (unsheathes TET quickly)</p>
<p>INU cuts the flash of light, which separates from JMR and fly into the bushes.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;He did it!</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; (on KAG's shoulder) He cut off the arm!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (looks around nervously, thinking) What's going on?! I didn't feel the arm sever! It just sort of separated from Juromaru…</p>
<p>JMR runs towards INU and attacks. INU dodges. Cut to close up of JMR emitting some gas around his mouth. His hands are bruised.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; The arm's intact!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (thinking) I knew it! That wasn't his arm that got cut off!</p>
<p>The ground behind INU suddenly loosen a little and a flash of light shoots up and cuts through INU's belly. INU lets out a yell of pain.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Huh?! The ground…!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Inuyasha!</p>
<p>The flash of light flies towards JMR and stops beside him. INU falls on his knees. The flash of light becomes clearer and reveals a scorpion-like demon, with a head exactly like JMR, except smaller. Slurping sounds are heard.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; W-what's that thing?!</p>
<p class="txt">Scorpion-Demon: The fellow's guts tasted pretty good, Juromaru.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Damn! So there's another one! J-just what are you?!</p>
<p class="txt">Scorpion-Demon: (laughs) I am Kageromaru. I was fast asleep inside Juromaru's belly.</p>
<p class="ttable">* Kageromaru abbreviated as KMR from now onwards *</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Inside Juromaru's belly? Then…!</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; So the bit was to prevent you from coming out!</p>
<p class="txt">KMR:&emsp;&ensp;Juromaru only listens to me. Even if the opponent was Naraku…</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;What?!</p>
<p class="txt">KMR:&emsp;&ensp;Now then, let's feast on the rest of them, Juromaru. It's all-you-can-eat!</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; (releases the prayer beads around his hand) Wind Tunnel!</p>
<p>KMR flies towards MIR and cuts his wrist. MIR winces in pain.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Monk!</p>
<p>JMR runs towards them. SAN throws HIR at JMR.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Hiraikotsu!</p>
<p>JMR punches HIR and it falls to the ground. SAN goes to pick up her boomerang. Above her, KMR flies downwards at her.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; (runs towards SAN) Sango!</p>
<p>MIR raises an arm and shields KMR's attack from SAN. MIR's back is slashed by KMR. KMR lands and laughs.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; (points his hand at KMR) Wind Tunnel!</p>
<p>MIR sucks in the ground around KMR.</p>
<p class="txt">KMR:&emsp;&ensp;Just what are you sucking up?</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; (points his hand in the trees) Are you above me?</p>
<p class="txt">KMR:&emsp;&ensp;Too late. And you think you can defeat us with that speed?</p>
<p>JMR attacks MIR and pins him on the ground.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Miroku! rushes forward and raise TET) Why you…!</p>
<p>INU slashes at JMR who notices and leaps away from MIR. The heavy TET barely misses MIR. JMR lands a little further.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Miroku, are you all right?!</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; (gasping for air) I was more afraid of your sword!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Then just pull over the covers and sleep it off! (turns to JMR) I'm coming!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(runs towards INU with SHI on her shoulder) Inuyasha, you mustn't move!</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; You have a hole in your belly!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Shaddup! This is nothing unusual—(turns to look at KAG and gasps)</p>
<p class="txt">KMR looms behind KAG and SHI.</p>
<p class="txt">KMR:&emsp;&ensp;(brandishes his claws, thinking) I'm taking this girl's life.</p>
<p>KMR turns into a flash of light and circles KAG.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (yells) Kagome!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Huh?!</p>
<p>KAG doesn't realize. KOG suddenly appears and kicks KMR away from KAG. KMR lands and leaps away. INU gasps and stutters.</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; Are you all right, Kagome?</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;K-Koga…?</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; Dogface! What's going on?! How dare you put Kagome in danger!? (walks towards INU)</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Shaddup! You ran off with your tail between your legs! But I'll thank you for just now! Stupid!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(to SHI) Was I in danger just now?</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; Looks like it.</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; (looks at KMR) So what is that stupid looking demon?</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; He came out of Juromaru's gut.</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; (thinking) No wonder… The cold I sensed coming from Juromaru… It was him.</p>
<p>Cut to MIR holding his Wind Tunnel hand which was slashed. SAN holds him up.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; That Kageromaru is so swift, we can't keep up.</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; (scoffs) Just who do you think I am? There's no one who can outrun these legs.</p>
<p class="txt">KMR:&emsp;&ensp;(laughs) It seems talk is all you have.</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; Well, that does it! I'll twist your head off!</p>
<p>KOG sprints towards KMR and punches him. KMR dodges and KOG punches the ground instead.</p>
<p class="txt">KMR:&emsp;&ensp;(sniggles) You're not worth your talk. Is that as fast as you can go?</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; Damn!</p>
<p>JMR rushes out of the bushes behind KOG and flies towards KOG.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (sprints towards JMR) Juromaru! I'm your opponent!</p>
<p>JMR notices and dodges before INU swings his TET downwards. JMR lands on TET's blade and leaps towards INU, grabbing his face.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Inuyasha!</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; Shame on you, dogface! A stupid demon like that should be an easy prey!</p>
<p>JMR pins INU on the ground.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; What?! (punches JMR away) You! (gets up and runs next to KOG, back facing him) What about you? Haven't caught Kageromaru yet?</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; (scoffs) Don't compare me to you!</p>
<p>Something flashes above KOG.</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; (runs towards KMR on the ground) Whoa! (swings his fist) I can see you now!</p>
<p>KMR dodges and runs away, leaving KOG to punch the ground. KOG chases and catches up with KMR.</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; Right here!</p>
<p>KOG blocks KMR path and he stops.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; He's anticipating Kageromaru's moves.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Amazing!</p>
<p>KMR leaps at KOG, who punches in his direction. KMR dodges the punch but KOG raises his foot and kick KMR as he tries to escape. KMR falls onto the ground.</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; (raising a fist in KMR's direction) Finishing blow!</p>
<p>KOG hits the ground where KMR is and the ground explodes.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;He did it!</p>
<p>The dust settles, revealing an empty hole where KOG punched.</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; (gasps) Gone! He escaped!</p>
<p>Cut to INU facing off with JMR. The ground suddenly rumbles. KOG turns around. KMR leaps from the ground and cuts INU's arm.</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; (turning around) W-what! From beneath the soil!</p>
<p>JMR takes the chance and punches INU, who crashes into a tree behind him. INU gasps in pain.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Inuyasha!</p>
<p>KOG chases KMR and punches, but KMR goes into the ground again, making KOG punch the ground instead.</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; Damn! He went under again!</p>
<p>KMR leaps out from the ground and slashes KOG's left thigh.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; No! With his legs injured, there's no way he can win!</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;(turns to look at INU) Inuyasha is still unconscious.</p>
<p>KOG lays on the ground, gripping onto his thigh and trembling in pain. KMR is beside him.</p>
<p class="txt">KMR:&emsp;&ensp;(laughs and turns around) Now then…I think I'll have that girl's liver.</p>
<p>KAG and SHI gasp.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (wakes) W-what?!</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; (struggling) Kageromaru, don't you dare touch Kagome--!</p>
<p class="txt">KMR:&emsp;&ensp;(flies towards KAG) I'll eat her bones and all!</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; (sprints towards KAG) No way!</p>
<p>JMR suddenly appears and attacks KOG. Cut to KAG and SHI. KMR suddenly appears in front of them.</p>
<p class="txt">KMR:&emsp;&ensp;Too late! (brings his claw down at KAG and SHI)</p>
<p>The screen fades to white and cutting sounds are heard. The screen reverts to normal. INU leaps through the air and just cut off one of KMR's claws.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Inuyasha!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Why you--! (swings TET downwards at KMR who dodges)</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Inuyasha…did the sword become light? He's wielding the Tetsusaiga with one hand.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; He's so simple-minded. He got so mad, he forgot how heavy it is.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Hah! Who's simple-minded?</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; He heard me?</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Did he go under again?</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(runs to INU) Inuyasha! (puts a hand on INU's chest)</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Kagome, are you all right?</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Yes…but look at your wound, it looks so terrible.</p>
<p>Cut to KOG dodging JMR's attacks.</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; Dogface, he's still alive?</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; Koga's leg has been injured.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (waves away KAG's hand and walks forward) Tsk! That guy is so useless! Just watch me, wolf cub! I shall defeat Juromaru—(swings TET over his shoulder and gasps as he falls backwards at the weight)</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Did it get heavy again?</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Earlier, he was so focused on protecting Kagome, but now…</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; What?!</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; Coward…lost your nerve, huh?!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; What?! Shaddup! (stands properly and chases JMR) I'll finish you off, too—</p>
<p>INU is stopped short as KMR suddenly leaps at him. He then attacks KOG who dodges. JMR then attacks KOG, who dodges again. JMR continues his leap and flies towards INU.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Why you--! (swings TET)</p>
<p>JMR leaps above the sword. KMR suddenly appears from the ground beneath and flies at INU, who dodges and falls to the ground. KMR then returns into the ground. JMR tries to attack INU again.</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; (kicks JMR away from INU) Take this!</p>
<p>JMR lands in front of INU.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (gets up) I won't thank you!</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; (stops in front of INU) I demand a thank-you! (runs off)</p>
<p>JMR attacks INU who dodges. JMR rebounds off a tree and chases INU.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;If this fight continues, even Inuyasha can't hold up.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; There's no way of knowing where underground Kageromaru will attack.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;I know…! If at least Kageromaru can be restrained… (reaches into her shoulder cap) Miroku, give me your staff.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; (hands SAN his staff) Do you have a plan?</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;(opens a clam with purple powder and puts the base of MIR's staff into the powder) This poison won't work too long…but it should force Kageromaru out into the open. (stands up and throws the staff)</p>
<p>MIR's staff hits the ground. The ground around the base slowly turns red and spreads outwards.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;The soil is turning red!</p>
<p>The ground rumbles and KMR bursts out, gasping for air.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; You did it!</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Capture Kageromaru! The poison must have slowed him down!</p>
<p class="txt">KMR:&emsp;&ensp;(lands on a branch) Why you…!</p>
<p>KOG appears behind KMR and swings a fist towards KMR, who leaps off. INU chases and blocks KMR's path. JMR appears and punches INU in the back. INU flies towards the tree and crashes into KOG, who was chasing KMR. They crash onto the trunk and falls onto the ground. INU lands on his side while KOG on his feet.</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; (scoffs) Shame on you, dogface! You gonna die this time?</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(running) Inuyasha! (holds up INU) Hang on!</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; Don't panic, Kagome. I can handle the rest all by myself.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; W-what…!</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; Without Kageromaru's tricks, this stupid demon is easy to handle. (sprints towards JMR) I can destroy one of his kind!</p>
<p>JMR waits for KOG, without moving an inch.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (looks around nervously, thinking) I don't sense Kageromaru's presence. Has he hidden himself in the shadows? (gasps and look in JMR's direction) Or…could he be…?!</p>
<p>Cut to close up of JMR's face, who smirks slightly. Some light is seen in his mouth.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (yelling) Fool! Koga, come back!</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; (still running) Stay back, dogface!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Inuyasha, not in your condition--</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (picks up TET and runs) Move, Koga! (jumps above KOG's back) If you don't move, I'll kill you, too!</p>
<p>JMR opens his mouth and KMR rushes out at KOG.</p>
<p class="txt">KMR:&emsp;&ensp;Got you!</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; (shocked) What?!</p>
<p class="txt">KMR:&emsp;&ensp;(raises his right claw) It's too late for you to notice.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Shaddup!</p>
<p>INU swings TET downwards at the oncoming JMR and KMR. KOG dodges the blade in time and runs away. The sword cuts both JMR and KMR and surrounds them in a blaze of flames. Yells are heard as they disintegrates.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; Smithereens.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; He did it.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (looks up) It's over. You got in my way!</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; (punches INU's head from behind and INU falls over) Why you…! You meant to kill me, too, didn't you?!</p>
<p>INU straightens himself and sheathes TET. He glares at KOG sideways.</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; (clenching his fists) So you were serious!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (deadpan) Who knows?</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; I'll kill you!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(runs between KOG and INU and separates them) W-wait!</p>
<p>INU looks away defiantly.</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; You don't even give a damn… You just fling down your sword!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Well, he knew that with your speed, you'd get out of the way in time. (turns to INU) Right, Inuyasha?</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Damn! He's just a pesky wolf cub! (glares at KOG threateningly) Listen up! If you get in the way again, I'll really kill you!</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; Fine! Just try it! You stupid mutt!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; W-what?!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(firm) Inuyasha, sit!</p>
<p>INU crashes flat-faced on the ground.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(pleading) Koga, please just go today.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Why'd you do that, Kagome?!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(fierce) You're badly injured! If you fight any more, what do you think will happen?! (clasps her hands across her chest and say gently) Koga, thank you for today. You really saved us. We're so grateful.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; I don't think Koga will back off.</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; Kagome… (holds KAG's clasped hands)</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(stares at KOG's hands) Huh?</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; You're my woman. I can't leave you in the hands of that incompetent dogface.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(looks up to KOG) Huh…?</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (clenching his teeth, thinking) Damn, how dare he…!</p>
<p class="txt">KOG:&emsp; Whenever you're in danger, I will come to the rescue. See ya! (turns around and walks away)</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Huh?</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;He left.</p>
<p>KOG turns into a whirlwind and fades out into the bushes. KAG waves goodbye.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (struggling up) You wait…!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Sit!</p>
<p>INU falls flat-faced on the ground again.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; You let Koga get away again!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(kneels in front of INU) Well, Inuyasha, in your condition…</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Do you think I'd lose to that scrawny wolf cub?!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Look, let's just treat your injury.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (squirms away from KAG and buries his face in his arms) Never mind! And what's with that attitude of yours? Trying to make you feel good and flirting with him! It was so disgusting, I couldn't watch! Besides, you're—(gasps and looks up)</p>
<p>KAG looks very irritated and mad.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (sits up suddenly) W-why're you looking at me like that?</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;I'm going home.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Huh?</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(puts her hands on the ground and pivots forward, in very fierce tone) I'm going home!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Oh, go home! I won't stop you!</p>
<p>Cut to MIR and SAN looking bored.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; (sighs) Oh dear… Now that that's settled, shall we go?</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;We must tend to your wounds, too, Miroku. (puts a hand on MIR's back)</p>
<p>The two turns around and walks off.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG &amp; INU: Huh?</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; (appears from inside KAG's hair and jumps off) You two have to grow up like them. (follows MIR and SAN)</p>
<p>INU and KAG look at each other. They pause a moment and look away in indignation, making ‘Hmph!!' sounds.</p>

<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Naraku, who set a trap for Kikyo and Inuyasha fifty years ago, has set another to get rid of Kikyo. This is because the Onigumo part in Naraku still loves her and he detests it. Kikyo is in trouble!
