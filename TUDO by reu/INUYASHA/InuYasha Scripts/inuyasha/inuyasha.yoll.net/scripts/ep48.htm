Inuyasha decided to protect Kikyo… I can't stay be his side anymore… so I returned to my own time. But the jewel fragments are still with me… I should return them. But if I returned them, would everything end just like that…? I stood in front of the Sacred Tree where we first met… Next episode, 'Return to the Place Where We First Met'!</p>
<p class="header"><a name="1"></a>'Adult Swim' Synopsis</p>
<p>When Kagome witnesses Inuyasha embracing Kikyo, she flees back to her own time. Even though she decides it is better never to return to the feudal era, Kagome realizes that she still has shards of the Shikon Jewel in her possession. While she struggles with the decision, she begins to come to terms with her own feelings for Inuyasha.</p>

<p>Recap from previous episode. KAG peeps out from behind a tree to find INU and KIK hugging.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(thinking) Inuyasha and Kikyo? Why? What's going on?</p>
<p>The soul catchers surround KIK and lift her off the ground.</p>

<p>KIK is lifted high up in the sky.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (yells) Kikyo!</p>
<p>Cut to INU turning around and noticing KAG. She comes out from behind the tree and looks at him. INU looks back.</p>

<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(thinking) How? How can he not avert his eyes?</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (pauses and speaks softly) Kagome.</p>
<p>KAG steps backwards, looking confused. She turns around and runs off hurriedly, occasionally tripping. INU remains standing by the tree where he was sealed fifty years ago.</p><br>
<p>Daytime in KAE's hut. KAG is taking out things from her bag and placing them on the floor. MIR and SAN look at her in silence. SHI is sleeping.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Let's see… This is the antibiotic and this one's an ointment for pain. And…I brought lots of gauze and bandages. (stands up) Okay! I'll be off then.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Huh? Kagome!</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Are you going back?</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(waving her hand and smiling) Well…I just came to bring some medicine.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;At least make up with Inuyasha. It was a silly argument.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(thinking) Oh right, I had a fight with Inuyasha.</p>
<p>Flashback from previous episode, when INU was speaking to KIK.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; I don't care how you feel about me! (walks towards KIK) I won't let Naraku have you! (grabs KIK's shoulders) Only I can protect you from Naraku! (hugs KIK tightly)</p>
<p>KAG gasps as she witness the scene from behind a tree.</p>
<p>Cut to present, where KAG is falling in the Dry Well.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(thinking) I had forgotten all about the argument we had.</p>
<p>Cut to SAN looking into the well. MIR sit on the mouth on the well.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Miroku, Kagome seemed very depressed.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Yes. Well, I can guess why she's feeling that way.</p>
<p>SAN looks up at MIR.</p>
<p>Flashback of previous episode when KAE and MIR saw souls floating in the night sky.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Those lights!</p>
<p>Back to present. MIR is deep in thoughts. Footsteps are heard and MIR looks up. INU walks towards them slowly.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Inuyasha!</p>
<p>MIR stands up. INU stops.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Inuyasha, Kagome went back to her home again.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (lowers his head) I see…</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Inuyasha, you were seeing Kikyo, weren't you?</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Huh?</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; And Kagome saw the two of you. Isn't that so?</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (nods slightly) Yeah, she saw us.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;(angry) How could you sneak around like that?!</p>
<p>MIR gasps and walks towards INU. He looks amazed as he examines INU's face up-close.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Inuyasha! Your face looks like the Buddha!</p>
<p>Close-up of INU's expressionless face, with light sparkling off it.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; (amazed) Why're your face looking so calm and divine?</p>
<p>INU looks down and walks away. MIR and SAN look at his back as INU walks slowly away from them.</p><br>
<p>Daytime in KAG's room. She is sitting on her bed, looking depressed.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(thinking) That moment, Inuyasha didn't try to avert his eyes from me.</p>
<p>Cut-scene of INU looking at KAG in the forest in the previous night.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(voice-over, thinking) Inuyasha tried to tell me something but I was afraid to listen and ran away.</p>

<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(looks out of the window, thinking) Inuyasha had already decided.</p>
<p>Cut-scene from episode 1 where KIK fired an arrow at INU.</p>
<p class="txt">KIK:&emsp;&ensp; (drawing an arrow) Inuyasha! (shoots)</p>
<p>INU is pinned onto a tree by the arrow as the Sacred Jewel necklace falls out of his hands.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(voice over, thinking) Inuyasha and Kikyo hated each other because of Naraku's deception.</p>

<p>Back to present. KAG plops herself on her bed.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(thinking) There's no place for me between them! (buries her face into her pillow)</p><br>
<p>Evening in KAE's village. INU stands on a knoll overlooking the village, where INU and KIK used to sit.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (thinking) I can't forget Kikyo, after all. So, Kagome… (lowers his head and closes his eyes) I can't see you anymore. I mustn't.</p><br>
<p>Back with KAG on her bed.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(thinking) Kikyo gave her very life for Inuyasha's sake. (closes her eyes) I can't compete with that. (clutches at her pillow) I can't return to Inuyasha.</p>

<p>Morning in KAG's room. KAG wakes from her sleep. Cut to the clock on her bed stand. Her alarm is set for 7am, but it is only almost 6am. KAG stands up, opens her window and looks out. Downstairs, GRA is sweeping the courtyard.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(thinking) Inuyasha won't come for me anymore. (turns her head) But what'll I do? I brought the Sacred Jewel fragments back with me.</p>
<p>Cut to a container which two Sacred Jewel fragments.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(thinking) I should return them. (picks up the container and squeezes it tightly) Yes, after I return them, it'll be the end of it all.</p>
<p>Cut to KAG packing her bag. Cut to KAG combing her hair and looking into the mirror.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(thinking) I'll return to my normal existence.</p><br>
<p>At the breakfast table, the Higurashi family eats in silence.</p>
<p class="txt">Sota:&emsp;(to GRA) She returned so soon and she hasn't spoken at all since she returned… I wonder if something happened to Sis?</p>
<p class="txt">GRA:&emsp; (puts down his bowl) This is the cause. (holds out a thumb at SOT)</p>
<p class="txt">Sota:&emsp;(bewildered) A thumb?</p>
<p class="txt">GRA:&emsp; Fool! A man!</p>
<p class="txt">Sota:&emsp;Ah… Could she have had an argument with Inuyasha?</p>
<p class="txt">GRA:&emsp; (puts his hand to his mouth and coughs) Ahem, Kagome…</p>
<p class="txt">Mama: (cuts short GRA and offers him her plate happily) Grandpa! Would you like my egg?</p>
<p class="txt">GRA:&emsp; Oh, thanks.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;May I be excused? (stands up and puts her bowl into the sink)</p>
<p class="txt">Sota:&emsp;Sis…</p>
<p class="txt">Mama: (cuts short SOT and offers him another plate happily) Sota! These pickles are nice and crunchy. Try some.</p>
<p class="txt">Sota:&emsp;Uh-huh… (picks up a pickle with his chopsticks and eats it)</p>
<p class="txt">Mama: Kagome, no need to wash your dishes. I'll do them all together later.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Thanks. (turns off the tap)</p>
<p>KAG turns around and squats, patting Buyo who is eating on the floor. Buyo purrs.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(picks up her bag) I'm off.</p>
<p>The rest of the family, even Buyo, look as KAG walks out.</p>
<p class="txt">Sota:&emsp;Sis…</p>
<p class="txt">GRA:&emsp; Kago…</p>
<p>MOM quickly puts a hand over SOT's and GRA's mouths each, cutting them short. They struggle to break free.</p>
<p class="txt">Mama: (happily) Have a nice day!</p>
<p>A moment later, MOM lets go. SOT and GRA gasp for air.</p>
<p class="txt">GRA:&emsp; What are you doing?!</p>
<p class="txt">Sota:&emsp;Yeah! Aren't you worried about Sis at all?</p>
<p class="txt">Mama: (takes a pickle and throws it into her mouth) These pickles are really good!</p>
<p>SOT and GRA bend over and sigh.</p><br>
<p>On the streets, students are making their way to school. KAG lets out a long sigh as she walks along.</p>
<p class="txt">Eri:&emsp;&emsp; Kagome!</p>
<p>KAG turns around to find Eri, Yuka and Ayumi. They catch up with her, looking worried.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;'Morning!</p>
<p class="txt">YUK:&emsp;&ensp;You're out of the hospital?</p>
<p class="txt">AYU:&emsp;&ensp;You had some kind of mysterious rash all over your body?</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(thinking) I guess we're running out of feigned illnesses.</p>
<p>KAG and the trio walk along.</p>
<p class="txt">Eri:&emsp;&emsp; Say, never mind that. Whatever happened?</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Huh?</p>
<p class="txt">YUK:&emsp;&ensp;Don't act innocent. You know, the jealous, rude and spoiled guy of yours!</p>
<p class="txt">AYU:&emsp;&ensp;Did you split up?</p>
<p>KAG stops in her tracks.</p>
<p class="txt">YUK:&emsp;&ensp;Huh?</p>
<p class="txt">Eri:&emsp;&emsp; Kagome?</p>
<p class="txt">YUK:&emsp;&ensp;(whispering to the rest) Did I say something I shouldn't?</p>
<p>KAG walks in front of them, sighs and turns around.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(smiling brightly with light radiating from her face) He dropped me flat!</p>
<p>The trio gasps.</p>
<p class="txt">YUK:&emsp;&ensp;(thinking) Kagome isn't the one that dumped him?!</p>
<p class="txt">AYU:&emsp;&ensp;(thinking) Does that mean…?</p>
<p class="txt">Eri:&emsp;&emsp; (thinking) That she still loves him?!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(waving her hand) But I'm really fine.</p>
<p class="txt">Eri:&emsp;&emsp; You've gotten over him?</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(nods) Yes! So…don't bring him up again, okay? I'm fine.</p>
<p>The trio huddle together, trembling and smiling uncomfortably.</p>
<p class="txt">YUK:&emsp;&ensp;She doesn't want to be reminded 'cuz it hurts…</p>
<p class="txt">AYU:&emsp;&ensp;She's scary.</p>
<p class="txt">Eri:&emsp;&emsp; Her fake smile is scary.</p><br>
<p>In KAE's hut. SAN is tending to MIR's wound. INU sits on a ledge with arms folded. SHI and cute KIR look at INU.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; (clenching his fists angrily) Inuyasha! How could you?! (points an accusing finger at INU and jumps up and down) You were so upset because Kagome got friendly with Koga, yet now, you want to think only about Kikyo?!</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;How shallow your feelings were!</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Inuyasha, go see Kagome.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (irritated) Stop it, will ya?! I've decided not to see her again!</p>
<p>MIR gets up and thrust his foot on INU's face.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; (sternly) Stop misunderstanding me! Kagome took Sacred Jewel fragments with her! I'm telling you to go get them! Only you can pass through the well!</p>
<p>INU gasps and looks at MIR.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Just the Sacred Jewel fragments?</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; Don't you care about Kagome?!</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; It can't be helped. Inuyasha picked Kikyo. It's cruel to ask Kagome to come back.</p>
<p>INU looks down, deep in thought.</p><br>
<p>In the village, KAE is picking up some plants and putting them in a basket. INU sits on a fence near KAE.</p>
<p class="txt">KAE:&emsp;&ensp;Inuyasha… Are you really sure about this?</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; What, Kaede?! Not you, too!</p>
<p class="txt">KAE:&emsp;&ensp;The present Kikyo is made from earth and bones. She's not of this world.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (thinking) But Kikyo's spirit still remains.</p>
<p class="txt">KAE:&emsp;&ensp;Do you understand?! You two can never be together in this world! Sister Kikyo's wish is for the two of you to die together.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Fine…I'll got to hell with Kikyo, as she wishes. (thinking) If that's my destiny with Kikyo. (looks at the sky)</p><br>
<p>In the Dry Well structure in Higurashi shrine. KAG stands in front of the well, looking at the container of Sacred Jewel fragments in her hand.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(thinking) I must go to return the Sacred Jewel fragments. (climbs onto the mouth of the well and pauses) But I don't want to. I'm afraid! (gets off the well) Once I give this back, I won't be able to see Inuyasha again!</p>
<p>Cut-scene of KAG imagining INU talking to her.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Sorry, Kagome. I'm going to Kikyo.</p>
<p>Back to present.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(shakes her head, thinking) Don't tell me! That's…! (closes her head and lowers her head)</p>
<p>Flashback from previous episode when KIK and INU hugged, while KAG looks on from behind a tree.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Kikyo…</p>
<p>Back to present.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(clenches her fists, thinking) I wish Kikyo would just disappear!</p>
<p>KAG gasps and pauses.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(putting a hand on her face, thinking) Have… Have I turned into such a horrible woman? (lowers her head)</p>
<p>KAG walks out of the Dry Well structure into the courtyard.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(thinking) I… I probably have a horrible look on my face right now. (closes the door to the structure) I can't see Inuyasha looking like this.</p>
<p>KAG walks along the courtyard. She suddenly stops and gasps. She holds up the container of Sacred Jewel fragments, which are glowing gently.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(thinking) The fragments… (looks up and notices the tree where INU was sealed, thinking) The sacred tree… Yes… This tree… This is the tree on which Inuyasha was sealed. Five hundred years ago, this is where I first met Inuyasha.</p>
<p>Flashback from episode 1, when KAG met INU in the forest.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (pinned on the tree) What's that confused look on your face, Kikyo? So, are you satisfied, Miss Kikyo? Do it with one shot, will ya? Like the time you killed me!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Say, you keep calling me Kikyo, Kikyo! Let me tell you, my name is…!</p>
<p>Cut to KAG's memories of INU from episode 10, when he came to rescue her from the Thunder Brothers, and him yelling when he thought SHI and her had died.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(voice-over) Inuyasha!</p>
<p>Cut to KAG's memories of a human INU sleeping on her lap in episode 13, telling her that she smells nice.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(voice-over) Inuyasha!</p>
<p>Cut to KAG's memories of INU when they first embraced in episode 19.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(voice-over) Inuyasha…</p>
<p>Cut to KAG's memories from last episode, when INU saw her after KIK left.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Kagome…</p>
<p>Back to present. KAG gazes at the Sacred tree. Cut to KAG kneeling on the ground, with her head lowered.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(thinking) Why did I ever meet him? If it were going to hurt this much, I wish I had never met him! (a tear drop falls onto her thigh) But I want to see him! (looks up to reveal tears in her eyes, thinking) I want to see Inuyasha once more! (gets up and wipes away her tears, thinking) I…I'm in love with Inuyasha! Before I knew it, I had grown to love him so much!</p>
<p>MOM walks past with a bag of groceries. She stops and looks at KAG.</p>
<p class="txt">Mama: Kagome!</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(turns around and call softly) Mom… (pauses and runs to MOM) Mom!</p>
<p>KAG hugs MOM, who drops her groceries and holds her. KAG cries sadly. MOM looks at her gently.</p><br>
<p>Cut to KAG and MOM sitting on a bench under the Sacred tree. KAG wipes away her tears with her handkerchief.</p>
<p class="txt">Mama: Kagome…</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Huh?</p>
<p class="txt">Mama: (looks up at the tree) When you're close to this sacred tree don't you feel a strange power? As though you feel more true to yourself, like your heart feels much more pure? (KAG nods) This is where your father proposed to me.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Eh?</p>
<p class="txt">Mama: Of course, I loved him. But the day before, we had argued over something silly. I wasn't sure if we could make a go of it together. The moment I walked under this tree I felt things clearing up inside me and I accepted his proposal. And because I did, I was able to have you and Sota. I'm grateful to this tree.</p>
<p>MOM looks at KAG. She puts a hand on KAG's shoulder and gently pulls KAG towards her. KAG rests her head on MOM's shoulder.</p>
<p class="txt">Mama: I won't ask what's troubling you. But I have faith in you, Kagome. That you are a child who will choose the path that you believe in.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(smiles and says softly) Thanks, Mom.</p><br>
<p>In the feudal era. INU sits under the Sacred tree and SHI glares angrily while sitting on his knee.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; Inuyasha!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Shut up! I know!</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; I haven't said a word yet.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; You're gonna tell me to go see Kagome.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; If you know that, hurry!</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (thinking) But that'll mean saying goodbye to Kagome. Saying something I couldn't say the last time…I'll have to this time.</p>
<p>MIR, KIR and SAN appear and walk towards INU and SHI.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; You're not the one who's having a hard time. It's Kagome.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;Miroku is absolutely right. You've already made up your mind, so fine. But Kagome is probably so confused right now.</p>
<p>SHI leaps off INU's knee.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; If you're a man, you'll go to see Kagome and make a nice, clean break.</p>
<p>INU stands up and closes his eyes, looking frustrated.</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;I'll say…instead of dallying around forever.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (eyebrow twitching) Do you want me to split up with Kagome that much?!</p>
<p class="txt">MIR &amp; SAN: Don't you want to split up?</p>
<p>The four of them stare at INU.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (looks away) Who… Who said that?! I decided to protect Kikyo. So how can I ask Kagome to come back— (looks up to find everyone gone) Where is everybody?!</p>
<p class="txt">The four of them are walking away from INU.</p>
<p class="txt">MIR:&emsp;&nbsp; Boy, what a poor sport!</p>
<p class="txt">SAN:&emsp;&ensp;We'll call him &quot;Two-Faced&quot; from now on.</p>
<p class="txt">SHI:&emsp;&nbsp; Gotta keep things together.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (clenching his fists) Why you--!</p>
<p class="txtb">[ End of ACT II: 16min 21sec ]</p><br>
<p class="txtb"><a name="_ACT_III_"></a>[ ACT III ]</p>
<p>INU walks in the forest, towards the Dry Well.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (thinking) Nope… I can't ask her to come back. Kagome knows that. I must go. I must see her and bid her farewell. Otherwise I can't go on…</p>
<p>INU walks out of the forest, into the open field. The sun blinds him momentarily. Cut to KAG sitting on the Dry Well.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (thinking) Kagome…</p>
<p>KAG looks up at INU. They look at each other in silence.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(stands up) While I was back over there, I gave it a lot of thought. About you and Kikyo and…me.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Kagome, I…</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;I understand. I understand how you feel. So I thought I couldn't stay here with you.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Kagome… Until I met you, I never trusted a soul. But…you cried for my sake. You always stayed by my side. When I'm with you, I'm happy. You soothe my soul. But… I'm not supposed to be happy and have fun! Kikyo… Kikyo followed me in death. I must repay her with my death.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;I know. I can't compete with Kikyo. Because…I'm still alive. (sits on the well and looks into the distance) I've thought a lot about Kikyo, too. Kikyo and I are so different. Even the talk that I'm a reincarnation of Kikyo… But I'm not Kikyo. My heart belongs to me. But I've come to understand one thing about how Kikyo feels. Something she and I share. (looks at INU) The desire to see you again.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Huh?</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(looks down) When I realized that Kikyo and I felt the same thing, I felt a bit better. The desire to see you is the same. That's why I conjured up the courage to come and see you.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (thinking) Kagome…I've wanted to see you, too. But…</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;I want to stay with you, Inuyasha. I can't forget you.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (thinking) Kagome… How am I to answer you?</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;Inuyasha… Can I ask you one thing? (stands and walks up to INU) Will you let me stay?</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Stay… with me?</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(nods and smiles) Uh-huh. (thinking) I can never break the bond between Inuyasha and Kikyo. I understand that. But Inuyasha…I realized this. My meeting with you was no coincidence. I want you to live, Inuyasha.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; Kagome…</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(holds INU's hand) Let's go, Inuyasha.</p>
<p class="txt">INU:&emsp;&nbsp; (surprised) Yeah…</p>
<p>INU and KAG start to walk.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(thinking) I want you to be happy. I want you to laugh a lot.</p>
<p>Cut to close up INU's hand holding KAG's hand back. They stop and look at each other, smiling gently.</p>
<p class="txt">KAG:&emsp;&ensp;(thinking) I don't know what I'll be able to do for you…but I'll always stay by your side.</p>
