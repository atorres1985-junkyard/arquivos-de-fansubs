Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

<Myouga:    e~i,>
Myouga: Aww,
<Myouga:    KOMAkai koto o Guchiguchi to...>
Myouga: You're grumbling about such a minor thing...

(    Inuyasha does not in any way mention the readers, but I translated like
this to try and keep the spontaneous humour in the original. Inuyasha uses
a style used in comedy acts to point out comedic errors in another person,
and is also often used by fans to point out plot errors, inconsistencies
and the like.)

Inuyasha: .oO(It seems that he really has taken his younger brother's spiritual power, doesn't it.).

3
[Inuyasha speaks to Kagome behind him, without looking back, and Kagome
looks rather shocked.]
