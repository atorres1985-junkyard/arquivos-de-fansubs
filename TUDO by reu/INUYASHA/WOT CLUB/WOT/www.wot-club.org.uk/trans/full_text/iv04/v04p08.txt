Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

[Kagome is sitting on the ridge of the Bone Gobbling Well in the Sengoku
Jidai, with Shippou sitting next to her. Kagome has her right arm raised to
her face and Myouga is perched on her hand. Kagome has several small
plasters over her body.]
<Kagome:    Tatari Mokke... tte iu no? ano YOUKAI.>
Kagome: That Youkai's... is called the 'Tatari Mokke'?
<Myouga:    umu,>
Myouga: Yeah,
<Myouga:    kagome no KUNI ni mo oru no ka.>

[Closeup of Myouga.]
<Myouga:    HONRAI wa KOdomo no REI o nagusameru YOUKAI de na,>

4
[Closeup side view of Kagome.]

[Closeup of Myouga on Kagome's finger while she looks on in concern.]
<Myouga:    AKURYOU ni narikiru MAE ni...>

<Myouga:    Tatari Mokke ga JIGOKU ni TSUrete iku n-ja.>
Myouga: the Tatari Mokke takes them to Hell.

(    The Centipede Jourou from right at the beginning was refered to as a 'Mono
no Ke' ('evil spirit'), and this is quite an old word. 'Akuryou', which I'm
translating as 'Poltergeist' (even though it doesn't literally mean this)
is nastier than a 'Mono no Ke'.)

6
[Black frame.]
<Kagome:    sore ja, ano ME ga HIRAkikitte shimattara...>

[Closeup of Inuyasha as he turns to look at Kagome.]
<Inuyasha:    tata_KItte dou naru tte mon ja nee n-da.
