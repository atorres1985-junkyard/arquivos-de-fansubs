Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

Shippou: My Otou was also...
<Shippou:    kore de yarareta.>
Shippou: taken out by this.

(    Considering what this blast does, it's a wonder that any of Shippou's dad
remained to make a pelt from, although since he had a Shikon no Tama
fragment, he might have regenerated a bit, before the fragment was taken
from him in his weakened state.)
