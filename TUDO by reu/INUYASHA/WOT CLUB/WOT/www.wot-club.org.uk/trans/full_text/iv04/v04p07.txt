Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

[Houjou is standing in the cobbled yard in his school clothes holding a
small wrapped up package, standing in front of Kagome's grandfather who has
a broom, and is standing near the small shrine which contains the Bone

- it is used like a name. It is playing a pipe called a ocarina, and it
plays a low, continuous tone.)
