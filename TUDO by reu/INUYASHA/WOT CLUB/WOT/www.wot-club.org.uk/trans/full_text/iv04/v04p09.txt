Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

(    'Jugyou Sankanbi' (Inspection Day) is an event in primary schools in Japan.
A special day is arranged for the pupil's parents, and they visit the
school and are allowed to watch one class, standing at the rear of the
classroom. This is a chance for school to show their jobs to the parents,
and for parents to see how their children are doing in class, and for
children, this is a particular event to show their parents how hard they
are studying.)
