Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

Hiten: you better not be lying.
<Kagome:    fu_...>
Kagome: Heh...

4
[Closeup of Kagome looking to the side, against a bubbly background, with
her hand to her cheek as if embarrassed.]
<Kagome:    INUYASHA wa ne,>
Kagome: The thing is, Inuyasha's...
<Kagome:    WATASHI ni HOreteru no.>
Kagome: in love with me.

5
[Kagome is in daydream mode, speaking with her back turned on the other two
(who look a little surprised), clutching her hands together and looking up
into the heavens against a flowery background.]
<Kagome:    WATASHI to KOUKAN tte Ieba,

to Inuyasha while he leaps over the ground.]

<Shippou:    ora wa otou no KATAKI o Utsu n-jai.>
Shippou: I'm gonna get revenge on Otou's enemy.



Page 8
1
[Sitting in the basket, Shippou talks down to Inuyasha, who looks rather amused.]
<Shippou:    omae koso HONTOU ni TSUyoi jarou na_.>
Shippou: Then what about you - are you really strong, huh?
<Shippou:    RAIJUU domo wa SHIKON no kakera de YOURYOKU o TAKAmeteru n-ja zo.>

[Closeup side view of Inuyasha looking to the side at Myouga sitting on the
rosary, sweating a little.]
Fx Myouga: *sigh...* <fu--->
<Myouga:    sore yori kagome no MI ga SHINPAI ja..>
Myouga: Besides that, I'm worried about Kagome's safety...
<Inuyasha:    n?>
Inuyasha: Hn?

3
[Closeup of Inuyasha looking as if he doesn't care.]
<Inuyasha:    ke_ ano ONNA wa DAIJOUBU daro.>

seriously worried.]

<Shippou:    ho, HONTOU ka!?>
Shippou: Re, really!?

6
[Closeup of Shippou looking quite worried.]
Fx Shippou: *panic panic* <oro oro>
<Shippou:    do, dou shyou.>

[Inuyasha speaks angrily at Shippou, who responds angrily.]
<Inuyasha:    ba-ka,>
Inuyasha: _Idiot_,
<Inuyasha:    kagome no doko ga ii ONNA da yo_.>
Inuyasha: Where do you see a pretty lady in Kagome!
<Shippou:    nanii!? omae no ME wa FUSHIANA ka_.>
Shippou: _What!?_ Are your eyes useless holes!?

(    The Japanese from which "pretty lady" comes, "ii onna", is associated with
women older and more mature than Kagome, so Inuyasha is correct to some
extent. However, Inuyasha would probably not agree that Kagome is
"bishoujo" (pretty girl) either.)

2
[Inuyasha turns, looking worried at Myouga on his shoulder, while Shippou
looks panic stricken and is shaking his head back and forth.]
<Myouga:    umu,>
Myouga: Well,
<Myouga:    washi mo ii ONNA da to OMOi masu zo.>
Myouga: I too think she's a pretty lady.
<Shippou:    aa~~~_,>

small wheels with spectral flames, and holding his long spear, while

Shippou: He, hey! What has happened to Kagome!
<Hiten:    fu_.>
Hiten: Heh.
