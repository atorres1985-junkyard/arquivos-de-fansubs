Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

<Kagome:    anta no Pe-su ni Awasetetara SHInjau wa yo.>
Kagome: If I tried to follow your pace, I'd die.

(    Kagome uses a foreign loan-word for 'pace' - which the others probably
wouldn't understand. (unless they're picking up Japlish from Kagome))

4
[Miroku gives a little speech which seems to surprise Inuyasha.]
<Miroku:    SUKOshi wa KI o TSUKAtte oagenasai.>

Myouga: Inuyasha-sama! When did you say that!?
<Inuyasha:    yakamashii_!>
Inuyasha: Shut up!

(    I'm not really sure what Miroku's saying above, or why Kagome's clapping -
attempting a "time out" or something...?)

6
[In Kagome's arms, Kirara suddenly perks up.]
