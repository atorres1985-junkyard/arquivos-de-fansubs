Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

Naraku in the background.]
<Title:    KATAKI>
Title: Nemesis

(    'Nemesis' is the best translation I could think of for 'kataki', which is
often translated as just 'enemy'. However, the word is often used in
association with avenging someone's death. Naraku has also been described
as being Kikyou's 'kataki'.)
