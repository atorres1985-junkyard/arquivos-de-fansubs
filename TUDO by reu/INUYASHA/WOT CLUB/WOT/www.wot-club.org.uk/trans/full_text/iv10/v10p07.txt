Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

[There is a procession of guards, 12 of which are carrying a carriage, and
one is holding out a flag in front, with a man banging a drum (or some kind
of percussion instrument) just behind him. Near to them are some villagers,
who appear to be sorting through some wreckage of trees and houses.]
Fx drum: clang <Ka---n>
<villager#1:    aa...>

>
villager#4: Everything is at last being taken to nanushi-sama's place, as indicated by Suijin-sama's arrow.

(    'nanushi' means 'village head'. 'Suijin' means 'water god', though this is
not necessarily <i>the</i> 'water god', probably just a local water god -
which are quite common in Japan.)

<villager:    sonna koto dekiru da ka ne HOUSHI-sama.>
villager: can you do that, houshi-sama?

6
[The village head looks angry.]
<village-head:    MINA no SHUU MADOwasareru na,>
village-head: Don't make the populace confused!
<village-head:    Inchiki ni KImattoru!>

[Scene of a village ruined by flood.]

<village-head:    sore koso MURA wa HORObosarete shimau zo.>
village-head: and then the village will be completely destroyed.

[The village head grips his hands, and has tears running down his cheeks.]
<village-head:    sou denakutomo washi no KO no BAN ni KAGItte, oHARAi ni sugaru nado...
**

village-head: If it wasn't for that, now that it's my own child's turn, all I will be able to do is pray...
<village-head:    IMA made IKENIE ni natta MURA no KODOMO-tachi ni Awasu KAO ga nai wa_!>
