Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

shallowly filled with soil, inside some room. There is a crack across it.]

<Inuyasha:    do-natte n-da yo, ano SANGO tte ONNA.>
Inuyasha: What's with that 'Sango' girl.

3
[Inuyasha turns to look at Miroku who's made a fire.]
<Inuyasha:    SHIRO no BASHO mo, AYAshige na WAKA-DONO no Tsura mo OMOiDAsene- nante yo.>
Inuyasha: She couldn't even remember what this suspicious 'young-master' at the castle looked like.
<Miroku:    gatagata Ittenai de KATAZUkenasai.>

<Miroku:    yoshinba OBOete ita to shitemo ano Kega desu.>
Miroku: Even if she remembers, she also has those wounds.
<Miroku:    IMA, SANGO o UGOkasu no wa MURI.>
Miroku: For the moment, Sango shouldn't be moving about.

2
[Inuyasha comes over to Miroku, pointing at himself, while Miroku gives him
a flat look.]
<Inuyasha:    tte mou, TOOKA mo NEKOnde yagaru ja nee ka.>
Inuyasha: Whatever, but you're not going to let her stay in bed for 10 fucking days are you?
<Inuyasha:    ore nara anna KIZU MIKKA de NAOru zo.>

[Kagome comes running up, looking a bit flustered, and Sango turns slightly
to the side.]
<Kagome:    SANGO-san, mada NEtenakucha...>
Kagome: Sango-san, you gotta sleep some more...

5
[Closeup of Sango.]
<Sango:    oHAKA...>
Sango: The graves...

6
[Kagome looks a bit surprised.]
<Kagome:    e...>
Kagome: Eh...



Page 16
1
[Kagome comes to stand beside Sango.]
<Sango:    minna no oHAKA TSUKUtte kureta n-da.>
Sango: You made graves for everyone.
<Kagome:    a...>
Kagome: Ah...
<Kagome:    un.>
Kagome: Yeah.

2
[Kagome crouches beside Sango, who looks depressed.]
Kagome: .......

3
[Kagome looks rather uncertain.]
<Kagome:    a, ano ne,>
Kagome: Um, um well,
<Kagome:    nante Itte ii ka wakannai kedo...>
Kagome: I don't really know what to say...

[Closeup of Kagome thinking.]

<Kagome:    kono KO, hitori bocchi ni nachatta wake da shi...>
Kagome: .oO(Because this girl has been left all alone...).

5
[Kagome seems to hit on something, though Sango doesn't respond.]
<Kagome:    a_ sou da.>
Kagome: Oh, that's right.
<Kagome:    KARADA NAOttara ISSHO ni Iko?>
Kagome: When you're healed, why don't we go together?

6
[Kagome continues, looking positive, though Shippou seems a bit surprised.]
<Kagome:    INUYASHA mo MIROKU-sama mo, suggoku ii HITO nanda yo KIHONTEKI ni wa.>
Kagome: Inuyasha and Miroku-sama are both really nice people, on a fundamental level.
<Shippou:    KIHON...?>
Shippou: Fundamental...?



Page 17
1
[Sango seems to change the subject.]
<Sango:    anta... SHIKON no kakera MOtteta yo ne.>
Sango: You... have the Shikon fragment, don't you.
<Kagome:    e...>
Kagome: Eh...

2
[Kagome takes out the glowing fragment.]
<Kagome:    un...>
Kagome: Yeah...
<Kagome:    nantoka Nise NARAKU kara toriMODOseta kedo...>
Kagome: Anyhow, we got it back from the fake Naraku, though...

3
[Closeup side view of Sango.]
<Sango:    sore ja NARAKU wa...>
Sango: Meaning Naraku will...
<Sango:    mata sore o NERAtte KUru ne...>
Sango: come after that again, right...

4
[Sango turns to Kagome.]
<Sango:    ii yo.>
Sango: Fine.
<Sango:    ISSHO ni Itte yattemo.
** yaru gives 'going to do' type sense, but 'yattemo'?
>
Sango: I will go with you.

5
[Closeup of Kagome.]
<Kagome:    SANGO-san...>
Kagome: Sango-san...
<Kagome:    minna no KATAKI o torutsumori na no ne.>
Kagome: You're planning to avenge everyone aren't you.

6
[Closeup of Sango.]
<Sango:    maa ne.>
Sango: Well yeah.
<Sango:    soreni SHIKON no TAMA wa...>
Sango: Besides, the Shikon no Tama...

7
[Closeup of Kagome.]
<Kagome:    kono SATO de Umareta no yo ne?>
Kagome: was born in this town, wasn't it?



Page 18
1
[Closeup side view of Kagome.]
<Kagome:    atashi-tachi sore ga KIkitakute,
                                 kiita kite?
>
Kagome: We heard about that,
<Kagome:    KIta n-dakedo...>
Kagome: but when we came...

2
[Kagome turns to see Sango walking off.]
<Kagome:    SANGO-san...?>
Kagome: Sango-san...?
Fx Sango: *stagger...* <Yoro...>
<Sango:    SANGO de ii yo.>
Sango: Just Sango is fine.

(    Since Kagome is a pretty proper girl, she has been saying 'Sango-san' -
Sango isn't obviously 'higher' or 'lower' than Kagome, and she is pretty
much a stranger, so '-san' is the only choice. Since Sango said she'll be
going with Kagome (and the others), they won't exactly be strangers
anymore, which is probably why Sango has chosen now to tell Kagome she can
just use 'Sango'.<br>
On a side note, it could be argued that Kagome saying 'Miroku-sama' is more
polite than she really needs to be. Though it probably don't seem like it
most of the time, Kagome does seem to realise Miroku's real nature (and not
the nice face he puts on), and has pretty much since they met - hence 'nice
on a fundamental level'. She could be using '-sama' to put a bit of
distance between her and Miroku. Miroku probably says 'Kagome-sama' partly
because he's always trying to chat up girls, and because Kagome is a bit
beyond a normal girl. Subtle, isn't it.)

3
[View from behind of Sango.]
<Sango:    minna no oTOMUrai mo shite moratta shi sa...>
Sango: Since you even held a funeral for everyone...

4
[Sango turns around to face Kagome.]
<Sango:    OSHIete ageru yo...>
Sango: I'll tell you about it...
<Sango:    SHIKON no TAMA ga Umareta WAKE...>
Sango: The reason why the Shikon no Tama was born...

5
[Kagome looks a bit surprised.]
<Kagome:    e...>
Kagome: Eh...
