Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

[Sango continues.]
<Sango:    mada KIZOKU ga YO no NAKA o OSAmete ita KORO--->
Sango: It was a time when the nobility were still in control of Japan.

(    Several hundred years before the then 'Sengoku Jidai' (Age of Wars), there
was a strong central government in Japan. However, for various reasons, the
government weakened and lost control, and all the local lords started
fighting with each other for control, thus beginning the Sengoku Jidai.)

EndFlashBack]

(    'Midoriko' (midori-ko) means 'green child' (sort of), and is a girl's name.

[FlashBack Midoriko faces a group of large Youkai, but masses of energy crackles from the end of her sword and stabs into the Youkai.

[Kagome and Shippou's eyes are spinning.]
<Shippou:    ora sappari wakaran.>
Shippou: I didn't get a thing.
<Kagome:    nanka... ICHIDO ni Iwaretemo...>
Kagome: It's like... even if he repeated it, [I still wouldn't understand]...

4
[Inuyasha, sweating somewhat, goes to Miroku.]
<Inuyasha:    ... sorede?>
Inuyasha: ... And then?
<Miroku:    AKUGYOU o OKONAeba SHIKON no HATARAki wa JAAKU ni KORObi,>
Miroku: If you do evil, the Shikon's actions fall down into evil,
<Miroku:    ICHIREI wa MAGATSUHI to nari HITO wa MICHI o AYAMAri masu.

[FlashBack Midoriko walks down some steps and in the trees and forest are Youkai
<Sango:    tonikaku, MIDORIKO to iu MIKO wa SHIKON o JUUKAshi,
**
>
Sango: Anyway, the Miko called Midoriko exorcised Shikon,
<Sango:    YOUKAI o MURYOUKU KAsuru JUUTSU o KOKOROEte ita.
**
>
Sango: and had much experience in using the spell to transform Youkai's power to nothing.

2
[Continuation of above frame.]
<Sango:    dakara YOUKAI-domo wa MIDORIKO o OSOre,>
Sango: That's why the Youkai were afraid of Midoriko,
<Sango:    INOCHI o NERAi hajimeta.>
Sango: and started trying to take her life.

3
[Black frame.]
<Sango:    dakedo yamikumo ni OSOtte mo JOUKAsarete shimau.>
Sango: But even if they attacked her suddenly, they were all exorcised.

4
[Swirling black frame.]
<Sango:    dakara MIDORIKO no REIRYOKU ni UchiKAtsu, KYOUDAI de JAAKU na TAMASHII o MOtsu HITSUYOU ga atta.>
Sango: Which is why, to overcome Midoriko's spiritual powers, a soul with massive evil was needed.
EndFlashBack]

<Sango:    YOUKAI-tachi wa sono OTOKO no KOKORO no SUKI ni tsukekonde,>
Sango: {voice over} The Youkai took advantage of the man's weakness,
<Sango:    TOriTSUita.>

5
[FlashBack A host of Youkai eat into Onigumo.
<Miroku:    YATOU ONIGUMO ga YOUKAI-domo ni KARADA o sashiDAshi,>
Miroku: {voice over} Isn't it the same as when wild-thief Onigumo submitted his body to the Youkai,
<Miroku:    NARAKU ni Umarekawatta nariyuki to ONAji dewa nai ka.>
Miroku: and was reborn as Naraku as the outcome?

2
[Midoriko punches into the main head with some force.]
<Sango:    sono TOKI MIDORIKO wa, SAIGO no CHIKARA de YOUKAI no TAMASHII o UBAiTotte,>
Sango: At that moment Midoriko, with the last of her power, seized the Youkai's soul,
<Sango:    JIBUN no TAMASHII ni toriKOmi...>
Sango: and her own soul was taken in...

3
[A blast of power comes out of Midoriko's back.]

Sango: In truth, depending upon the soul of the person who holds the Shikon no Tama,
<Sango:    YOkumo WARUkumo naru rashii.>
Sango: they become better or worse, it seems.

4
[Misty frame.]
<Sango:    YOUKAI ya AKUNIN ga MOteba KEGAre ga MAshi...>
Sango: If a Youkai or evil person holds it, their corruption increases...

Sango: In the hundreds of years since, various Youkai and humans have gotten hold of the Shikon no Tama on occasion,
<Sango:    atashi no jii-san no DAI ni, kono SATO ni MODtte kita.>
Sango: and in my grandfather's time, he brought it back to this town.

2
[Kagome and Sango look at the pile of Youkai.]
<Kagome:    MODOtte...?>
Kagome: Brought back...?
<Sango:    TAIJIshita YOUKAI no KARADA kara DEte kita n-da yo.>
Sango: He got it from a Youkai he exterminated.
<Sango:    jii-san mo sono TOKI no KIZU ga MOTO de, mamonaku SHInda kedo...>
Sango: Soon afterwards grandfather also died from the wounds he got at the time...

3
[Black frame with the Shikon no Tama.]

Sango: But by that time, the Shikon no Tama had already been,
<Sango:    hidoku KEGArete ite...>
Sango: dirtied badly...

<Inuyasha:    sorede...>
Inuyasha: .oO(Then...).
<Inuyasha:    KIKYOU no TE ni YUDAnerareta no ka.>

3
[View of Naraku, with his miasma swirling around him.]
<Miroku:    KIKYOU-sama no KOKORO o NIKUshimi de KEGAshi,>
Miroku: If he could dirty Kikyou-sama's heart with hatred,
<Miroku:    SHIKON no TAMA ni URAmi no CHI o SUwaseyou to...>
Miroku: and suck up malicious blood with the Shikon no Tama...

4
[Closeup of Sango.]
<Sango:    TAMA ga...>
Sango: the Jewel...
<Sango:    KUri KAEsasete iru n-da.>
