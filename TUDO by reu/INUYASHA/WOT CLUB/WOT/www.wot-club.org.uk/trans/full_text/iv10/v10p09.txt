Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

<Miroku:    shikkari nasai.>

Miroku: Aren't you worried?
<Miroku:    MItatokoro anata-gata mo SUIJIN no KENZOKU no you da ga...
** kenzoku = ?
>
Miroku: Aren't you involved with the Suijin...

[Closeup of the two fish, with tears running down their faces.]
<fish#1:    ano SUIJIN wa...>
fish#1: That suijin...
<fish#2:    Nise MONO de gozaimasu.>

[View of Miroku and Sango.]
<Miroku:    Nise MONO... to ii masu to?>

<Sango:    YOUKAI datte iu no?>
Sango: Meaning it's a Youkai?

2
[Drawing of the fake suijin.]
<Miroku:    nanka... CHIGAu KANji datta kedo,>
Miroku: Somehow... I get the feeling that's not the case,
<Miroku:    soreni ano nantoka iu JINGI...>
Miroku: and also this is that holy weapon, whatever it was called...

3
[The fish explain some more.]
<fish#1:    ano MONO wa motomoto wa, WATASHI-domo to ONAji kono MIZUUMI ni SUmu SEIREI.>
fish#1: That person originally used to be a spirit residing in this lake, like us.
<fish#2:    HONTOU no SUIJIN-SAMA ni TSUKAeru MI de gozaimashita.>
fish#2: He served the real suijin-sama.

4
[Miroku and Sango turn to look at a large mount of rock in the mists behind them.]
<fish:    sorega... SUIJIN-SAMA o damashite ano IWA ni YUUHEIshi,>
fish: {off} However... he tricked suijin-sama who was then imprisoned in that stone,
<fish:    JINGI "AMAKOI no HOKO" o UBAtte,>
fish: and he stole the holy weapon, "Halberd of Amakoi",
<fish:    SUIJIN-SAMA ni narikawatte shimatta no desu.>
fish: and took the place of suijin-sama.

(    'Amakoi' is a rare kanji, and apparantly means something like "sacrifice
for the rain god".)



Page 17
1
[Miroku looks at the fish.]
<fish#1:    SEIREI to wa ie, JINGI o MOtte shimattara CHIKARA wa KAMI to ONAji.>
fish#1: Even though he was just a spirit, now that he has taken the holy weapon, his powers are the same as a god.
<fish#2:    DAREmo sakaraezu...>
fish#2: And nobody can oppose him...
Fx fish: *sob sob* <shiku shiku shiku shiku>
<Miroku:    naruhodo.>
Miroku: I see.

2
[Closeup of Miroku.]
<Miroku:    wakarimashita.>
Miroku: I understand.
<Miroku:    HONMONO no SUIJIN-SAMA o oSUKUi shimashou.>
Miroku: Let's rescue the real suijin-sama.

3
[Miroku turns at a voice behind him.]
<Inuyasha:    nani... YUUCHOU na koto Itte yagaru...>
Inuyasha: {off} Sheesh... that's so fucking boring...

4
[Miroku turns to look at Inuyasha, who is starting to stand up.]
<Miroku:    INUYASHA Okita no ka.>
Miroku: Inuyasha, you're awake huh.
<Inuyasha:    ore wa... YASHIRO ni HIkiKAEsu.>
Inuyasha: I am... going back to the shrine.

5
[Miroku looks at Inuyasha, who shouts back.]
<Miroku:    MAchinasai,>
Miroku: Wait,
<Miroku:    SUIJIN-SAMA o TASUkeDAshite, CHIE o KAriru no ga HAYA-MICHI...>
Miroku: rescuing suijin-sama and using his wisdom would be the fastest way...
<Inuyasha:    kagome o TASUkeru no ga SAKI da_!>
Inuyasha: I'm saving Kagome first!



Page 18

[Inuyasha rushes off, looking angry.]
Fx Inuyasha: whoosh <Go_>
<Inuyasha:    kagome! BUJI de iro!!>
Inuyasha: Kagome! Stay safe!!

2
[The fake suijin is walking along a corridor, looking dark and menacing, the
holy weapon leaving a glowing trail of power.]
Fx suijin: *slide...* <Zu...>
<suijin:    KOMUSUME ga...>
suijin: I'm going to...
<suijin:    KUSHIZAshi ni shite kureru...>
suijin: skewer that wench...
