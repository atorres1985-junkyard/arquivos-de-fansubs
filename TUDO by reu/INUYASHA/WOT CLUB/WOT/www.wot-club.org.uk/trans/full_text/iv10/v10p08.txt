Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

suijin: Did you think a mere Youkai weapon could face my holy weapon - "Halberd of Amakoi"?

(    Not sure what 'amakoi' means (amagoi means 'praying for rain' incidentaly)
as I couldn't find it in any dictionary. A halberd is a spear like weapon -
a long shaft with a double-edged blade on the end.)

<Kagome:    JINGI o MOtteru tte koto wa...>
Kagome: Since he's holding a holy weapon...

6
[View of the suijin.]
<Kagome:    YOUKAI ja nakute, HONTOU no KAMI-SAMA tte koto...?>
Kagome: {off} it means he's not a Youkai, but a real kami-sama...?

(    'kami-sama' is Shinto for a god.)



Page 18
1
[Closeup of Inuyasha.]
<Inuyasha:    ke_,>
Inuyasha: Bah!
<Inuyasha:    koko made KIte nani bibitte yagaru!>
Inuyasha: We came all this way and now you're chickening out!
<Inuyasha:    koitsu yatteru koto wa, YOUKAI to ONAji ja nee ka.>
Inuyasha: Going by what this guy did, he's the same as a Youkai, isn't he.

2

Fx sound: rumble... <Go--->
