Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

left shoulder, as he speeds through the air. He's carrying Sango's
boomerang as well, and Shippou is sitting on one end with Sango's mask over
his head.]

[Sango looks hard at Inuyasha in front of her, and looks shocked. Inuyasha
turns partly back to look at her.]
<Sango:    omae...>
Sango: You...
<Inuyasha:    KI ga tsuita ka.>

2
[Sango speaks angrily to Inuyasha.]
<Sango:    Orose!>

<Sango:    atashi o dou suru KI da.>
Sango: What are you intending to do to me?
<Inuyasha:    nani~
** don't get this
>
Inuyasha: Wha~at!?

3
[Kagome suddenly appears - she's just pushed aside Inuyasha's hair, and
she's on the right hand side. Kagome looks calm but Sango still looks
rather shocked.]
Fx Kagome: *part hair* <Hyoi>
<Kagome:    NARAKU o Otte-ru no yo.>

<Inuyasha:    temee, kore IJOU udaudanukasu to SUtete-ku zo.

[Sango looks angry, while Kagome frowns at Inuyasha.]
<Sango:    na_...>
Sango: Wha...
<Kagome:    mo~ INUYASHA,>
Kagome: Sheesh, Inuyasha,
<Kagome:    anta so- yu- IiKATAsuru kara GOKAIsaren no yo.>
Kagome: if you put it like that, she'll misunderstand.

6
[Kagome puts a hand on top of Inuyasha's head, and speaks to Sango, while
Inuyasha gives a menacing look.]
<Kagome:    gomen ne, KUCHI to MEtsuki wa WARUi kedo,>
Kagome: Sorry about him - his speech and his expressions are bad, but,
<Kagome:    HONTOU wa yasashii toko mo aru no yo.>
Kagome: there is actually a nice side to him.
<Inuyasha:    omae na-.>
Inuyasha: Why you.

7
[Sango turns to the side to see Myouga sitting on her shoulder.]
<Myouga:    SANGO,>
Myouga: Sango,
<Myouga:    INUYASHA-sama-tachi wa, TEKIZU o otta omae o hotteoke nakatta n-ja.
** hotte okenakatta = couldn't leave (you) alone?
** seem to be missing what Myouga's hinting at
>
Myouga: you're injured, and Inuyasha-sama and the others could have just left you alone.
<Sango:    MYOUGA-jii...>
Sango: Myouga-jii...

(    Obviously Sango knows Myouga - 'jii' is short for 'jii-san' -
grandfather/old man.)
