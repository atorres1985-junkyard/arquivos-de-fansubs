Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

Miroku: Considering the elder princess, I'm sure the younger is beautiful too...
<Miroku:    iya iya.>
Miroku: Well, whatever.

(    Miroku's second comment is to camouflage his first comment, to hide his
real intention/hope - that the younger princess is beautiful, and so...)
