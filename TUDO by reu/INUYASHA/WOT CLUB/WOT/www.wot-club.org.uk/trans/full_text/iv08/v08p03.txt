Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

[Kikyou and Inuyasha sit in a bed of flowers, a few feet from each other,
and are not paying attention to each other.]
<Title:    NARAKU>
Title: Naraku


(    A reminder, 'naraku' means 'hell', 'hades', 'the abyss'.)

[Inuyasha and Miroku have Naraku cornered (sort of) in a small clearing in a
forest, and Naraku is wearing the same baboon pelt as always. A bit off,
Kikyou and Kagome look on.]
Fx leaves: rustle... <Zawa...>
<Inuyasha:    toutou Oitsumeta...>
Inuyasha: .oO(I've cornered him at long last...).

[Closeup of Inuyasha gritting his teeth in anger.]
<Inuyasha:    NARAKU...>
Inuyasha: .oO(Naraku...).

[Closeup side view of Naraku.]
<Naraku:    kukuku INUYASHA....>
Naraku: Kukuku. Inuyasha...
<Naraku:    naze JIBUN ga NIKUmarete iru no ka...>
Naraku: You want to know the reason why you are hated, huh...
<Naraku:    WAKE mo wakaranu dewa SHIndemo SHI ni kire n-darou na.
'wake' has kanji for 'riyuu' (reason)
>
Naraku: Can't you die or go to death without understanding the reason.

(    'kukuku' is an evil, mocking laugh.)

2
[Closeup of Inuyasha looking slightly confused.]
Inuyasha: ............
<Inuyasha:    temee ittai nan n-da?>
Inuyasha: What the hell do you mean, bastard?

3
[Closeup of Naraku smiling.]
<Naraku:    kukuku...>
Naraku: Kukuku...

4
[Naraku turns to look back at Kaede, with Kagome beside her, and Shippou
clinging onto Kagome.]
<Naraku:    KAEDE...>
Naraku: Kaede...
<Naraku:    sukkari TOSHIOita na.>
Naraku: You've really aged, haven't you.
Kaede: !

5
[Kaede looks rather angry.]
<Kaede:    washi o SHItte oru no ka.>
Kaede: Do you know me?
<Kaede:    kisama yahari...>
Kaede: Arsehole, you really are...

[Drawing of Onigumo lying on a grass mat, with a drawing of Inuyasha overlaid.]
<Inuyasha:    ONIGUMO na no ka!>
Inuyasha: Onigumo, aren't you!

2
[Drawing of Kikyou tending to Onigumo's wounds in the cave.]
<Inuyasha:    KIKYOU ga kakumatte ita to iu TEOi no YATOU...>
Inuyasha: .oO(The wounded wild-thief, who Kikyou is said to have sheltered...).

3
[Closeup of Naraku.]
<Naraku:    kukuku TASHIka ni...>
Naraku: Kukuku. It certainly is the case that...
<Naraku:    kono NARAKU wa GOJUU NEN MAE, ONIGUMO no DOUKETSU de Umareta.>
Naraku: 50 years ago, I, Naraku, was born in Onigumo's cave.

4
[Kagome looks slightly surprised.]
Kagome: ...?

5
[Drawing of Kikyou with her bow.]
<Naraku:    soreto iu no mo KIKYOU ga...>
Naraku: {voice over} Or it could be said that [I was born there because] Kikyou...



Page 5
1
[Drawing of Kikyou walking calmly in a forest, surrounded by many evil
looking creatures.]
<Naraku:    KIKYOU no REIRYOKU ga HIgoto ni YOWAmari,>
Naraku: {voice over} Kikyou's holy powers weakened daily,
<Naraku:    kono CHI no YOUKAI-tachi o FUUji kirenaku natte ita kara...>
Naraku: and stopped being able to hold back the Youkai of this world...

2
[Miroku, Kikyou, Shippou and Kaede ponder this.]
Kaede: ............

3
[Naraku turns to face Inuyasha.]
<Naraku:    naze da ka wakaru ka INUYASHA...>
Naraku: And why do you think that is, Inuyasha...



Page 6
1
[Kikyou walks under a cherry tree in full bloom, in which Inuyasha is
sitting looking down at her. Naraku is drawn over, looking slightly annoyed.]
<Naraku:    KIKYOU ga tsumaran HANYOU ni HOrete,>
Naraku: It's because Kikyou fell in love with a worthless Half-Youkai,
<Naraku:    tada no MURYOKU na ONNA ni narisagatta sei da.>
Naraku: and degraded herself into just a powerless woman.

(    This stresses more that it was Kikyou's fault, rather than Inuyasha's.)

2
[Inuyasha looks somewhat pained at this.]

3
[Kikyou prepares some medicine for Onigumo.]
<Naraku:    soshite ONIGUMO... ano JAKI no KATAmari no you na OTOKO wa,>
Naraku: {voice over} And Onigumo... that man packed with evil,
<Naraku:    KIKYOU ni asamashii OMOi o IDAite ita.>
Naraku: harboured despicable desires for Kikyou.

[Many different types of monsters surround Onigumo as he lies, immobile, on
the ground.]
<Naraku:    UGOkenu ONIGUMO no susamajiki JANEN wa DOUKETSU no NAKA ni KOmori,
                               susamajii
>
Naraku: {voice over} Unable to move, Onigumo's dreadfully evil thoughts filled up inside the cave,
<Naraku:    sono JAKI ga YOUKAI o YObiATSUme...>
Naraku: and that evil called in Youkai...

2
[FlashBack Closeup of Onigumo lying on the mat.
<Onigumo:    koko kara DErareru nara kisamara ni TAMASHII demo kurete yaru.
'koko' is highlighted.
>
Onigumo: I'll even give you my soul if I can get from _here_.
<Onigumo:    sono kawari ore ni JIYUU na KARADA o...>
Onigumo: In exchange, [give me] a body with which I can move freely...

3
[The monsters charge forwards.]
Fx monsters: rustle <Zazazaza>
<Onigumo:    SHIKON no TAMA o UBAi,>
Onigumo: Snatch the Shikon no Tama,
<Onigumo:    KIKYOU o ore no ONNA ni suru CHIKARA o yokose...>
Onigumo: and send me the power to make Kikyou my woman...

4
[The monsters tear into Onigumo.]
Fx Onigumo: (being eaten) crunch crunch <Baki Baki>
EndFlashBack]

1
[Everyone in the group is looking at Naraku.]
Fx leaves: rustle... <Zawa...>
<Naraku:    sou shite YOriATSUmatta YOUKAI ga hitotsu ni nari Umareta no ga,>
Naraku: And then, the Youkai bound together, and one was born,

2
[Closeup of Naraku.]
<Naraku:    kono NARAKU yo.>
Naraku: I, Naraku.

3
[Kagome looks at Kaede, who's asking a serious question.]
<Kaede:    dewa ONIGUMO wa...>
Kaede: Then, Onigumo was...

4
[Naraku turns to look at Inuyasha.]
<Naraku:    kuku_,>
Naraku: Kuku.
<Naraku:    YOGOreta TAMASHII mo TADADA mo... ano BA de KUraitsuku shite kureta wa.>
Naraku: Both his soiled soul and his body... were both eaten up on the spot, and he passed on.

5
[Miroku looks on.]
<Naraku:    YOiKOyashi gawari ni wa natta ga na.
                       substitute
>
Naraku: That piece of shit gave me a good bargain.

(    Naraku is showing his contempt for Onigumo, which I guess shows that he
does _not_ have Onigumo's personality or mind.)

6
[Closeup of Inuyasha looking quite angry.]
<Inuyasha:    ... naze ore to KIKYOU o WANA ni kaketa.>
Inuyasha: ... Why lay a trap for Kikyou and I?



Page 9
1
[FlashBack Naraku, as Inuyasha, attacks, and fells Kikyou, taking the Shikon no Tama.
<Naraku:    KImatte iru...>
Naraku: {voice over} It's obvious...
<Naraku:    KIKYOU no KOKORO o NIKUshimi de KEGAshi,>
Naraku: To soil Kikyou's heart with hatred,

2
[View of the whole Shikon no Tama with blood splattered around it.]
<Naraku:    SHIKON no TAMA ni URAmi no CHI o SUwaseru tama yo.>
Naraku: {voice over} and let the Shikon no Tama suck up malicious blood.

3
[Kikyou pins Inuyasha to the tree with an arrow.]
<Naraku:    SHINji atta MONO DOUSHI ga NIKUmiAi KOROshi au.>
Naraku: {voice over} The ones who trusted each other killed each other...
<Naraku:    kore hodo SUKUiGATAi koto ga aru ka.>
Naraku: Is there anything as appallingly tragic as this?

4
[Closeup of Kikyou just after firing the arrow at Inuyasha.]
<Naraku:    soshite OMOi ga TSUYOkereba TSUYOi hodo...>
Naraku: {voice over} And the more the feelings are strengthened...
<Naraku:    NIKUshimi wa MAshi TAMA wa KEGAreru.>
Naraku: the more hatred increases, and the Jewel is corrupted.
EndFlashBack]

5
[Naraku smirks at Inuyasha, who looks quite angry.]
<Naraku:    INUYASHA... omae to te KIKYOU o NIKUnda hazu da.>
Naraku: Inuyasha... you should have hated Kikyou, [as well as she hating you].
<Naraku:    kukuku...>
Naraku: Kukuku...

Inuyasha: Grr...



Page 10

[FlashBack View of the tree Inuyasha is pinned to.
<Naraku:    ato wa KIKYOU ga, WAgaMI kawaisa ni...>
Naraku: {voice over} The rest would have gone fine...
<Naraku:    SHIKON no TAMA ni GAN o kakereba YOkatta no da.>
Naraku: if Kikyou just made a vow to the Shikon no Tama to save herself.

2
[Kikyou holds the Shikon no Tama in her hands, while in the background
Inuyasha is pinned to the tree.]
<Naraku:    JIBUN dake wa Ikinagaraetai to...>
Naraku: {voice over} She should have shamefully pledged to god...
<Naraku:    asamashii GAN o kakereba YOkatta no da.>
Naraku: that she wished to survive by herself.
EndFlashBack]

3
[Closeup side view of Naraku.]
<Naraku:    sore o MAtte KIKYOU o YAtsuZAki ni shi,>
Naraku: I waited for that, and to tear Kikyou limb from limb,
<Naraku:    KEGAre kitta TAMA o itadaku hazu datta.>
Naraku: and I should have been able to claim the Jewel after it was dirtied.

4
[Drawing of Kikyou being cremated while holding the Jewel.]
<Naraku:    tokoroga ano ONNA...>
Naraku: However, that woman...
<Naraku:    SHIKON no TAMA o kakaekonde SHI ni otta.>
Naraku: died with the Shikon no Tama in her arms.
