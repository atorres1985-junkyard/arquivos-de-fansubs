Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

[Rouyakan looms over the ground.]
Fx Rouyakan: (walking) thud... <Zun...>
Fx Rouyakan: hssst... <Shu--...>
<Miroku:    osoraku ROUYAKAN wa, SHIKON no kakera no YOURYOKU o KArite imasu.>
Miroku: Perhaps Rouyakan is borrowing power from a Shikon fragment.
<Inuyasha:    nanii!>
Inuyasha: What!?



Page 9
1
[Inuyasha and Miroku face Rouyakan, standing near each other.]
<Miroku:    sono BASHO o SEIKAKU ni TSUkeba TAOseru hazu.>
Miroku: If we could strike it's location precisely, we should be able to destroy him.
<Inuyasha:    doko da!?>
Inuyasha: Where is it!?

2
[Miroku looks on at Rouyakan.]
<Miroku:    ainiku WATASHI no GANRIKI dewa...>

[Front closeup of Kagome, with a drink (like you get in a fast-food store)
in front of her.]
<Kagome:    atashi ga Tetsto ya HOUSHUU de MODOtteru TOKI nanka...>
Kagome: .oO(Back when I returned for my tests and supplementary lessons...).
<Kagome:    MITSUKA ni ICHIDO wa JAMAshi ni KIteta kuse ni...>
Kagome: .oO(he came over to disturb me at least every 3 days, [but this time]...).

(    Kagome is presumably referring back to volume 3, when she went back for a
while, and had to retake maths, and missed a date with Houjou.)

2
[White frame.]
<Kagome:    mou ISSHUKAN mo...>
Kagome: .oO(It's already been a week...).
<Kagome:    RENRAKU kurai shirottsu- no yo.
                          shiro to iu no yo

<Kagome:    e".>
Kagome: _Eh_.
<mother:    doushita no? Bo~tto shite.>
mother: What's up? You're all spaced out.

4

Houjou: ............

5
[Closeup side view of Houjou.]
Fx Houjou: *stare* <ji_>
<Houjou:    HIGURASHI...>
Houjou: Higurashi...
<Houjou:    MURI shite nai?>
Houjou: Aren't you overdoing it?

6
[Kagome looks a bit taken aback.]
Fx Kagome: *gulp...* <Doki...>
<Kagome:    e_...>
Kagome: Eh...



Page 11
1
[Behind Kagome is a drawing of Inuyasha, while Kagome looks somewhere
between surprised and pretending to be unconcerned.]
<Kagome:    ya, yada na- sonna koto...>
Kagome: Oh, oh no, it's not that bad...
<Kagome:    konna TOKI ni, nade ano Baka no koto bakkari KANGAete n-no yo.>
Kagome: .oO(At a time like this, why am I only thinking about that idiot.).

2
[Houjou continues to]
Fx Houjou: *stare...* <ji--...>
<Houjou:    ore ni wa nanto naku wakaru n-da yo ne...>

<Houjou:    HIGURASHI, HONTOU wa...>
Houjou: Higurashi, you really are...

3
[Kagome looks a bit embarrassed, sorry, and surprised. (argh, it's hard to
describe some of her expressions well)]
<Kagome:    HOUJOU-kun,>
Kagome: Houjou-kun,
<Kagome:    WATASHI BETSU ni...>
Kagome: I'm not really...
<Kagome:    anna yatsu no koto...>
Kagome: .oO([concerned] about a guy like that...).

(    Since Kagome doesn't finish the sentance she thinks to herself, we don't
really know what she's denying, though it could be anything from being
worried about Inuyasha, to being in love with him ^-^)

4
[Closeup of Houjou making a emphatic statement.]
Fx Houjou: *speaking forcefully* <Gu_>
<Houjou:    KARADA no GUAI ga WARUi no ni MURI shite DEtekita n-daro!?>
Houjou: Despite being in poor condition, you forced yourself to come out, didn't you!?

5
[Kagome falls off her chair.]

6
[Closeup of Kagome looking surprised.]

[Closeup of Kagome as she gets back onto her seat, with a drawing of
Inuyasha, badly injured, behind her.]

Kagome: .oO(Could it be... that his wounds haven't healed yet...).
<Kagome:    sore dokoro ka...>
Kagome: .oO(Not only was he wounded, but possibly...?).

(    Ah, Kagome... Houjou was talking about _your_ body... (he still thinks
you're having all these illnesses...))

2
[Closeup side view of Kagome looking almost ill.]
Fx Kagome: (heart) *thump thump thump* <Doki Doki Doki>
<Kagome:    masaka...>
Kagome: .oO(He couldn't have...).
<Kagome:    INUYASHA ga SHIne wake... nai kedo...>
Kagome: .oO(There's no way Inuyasha... would die, but...).

3
[Kagome looks up at Houjou with a sorry expression on her face.]
<Kagome:    HOUJOU-kun gomen...>
Kagome: Houjou-kun, I'm sorry...
<Kagome:    MUNE ga KURUshiku natte kita.>
Kagome: I've gotten this pain in my chest.
<Houjou:    yappari...>
Houjou: I knew it...

(    Kagome's probably intends to refer to her feelings when saying her chest
hurts - because she's concerned about Inuyasha, not that she's physically ill.)

4
[Kagome stands up and Houjou comes to stand next to her.]
Fx chair: clatter <Gatata>
<Houjou:    IE made Okuru yo.>
Houjou: I'll see you to your house.
<Kagome:    DAIJOUBU yo.>
Kagome: It's okay.

<Houjou:    HIGURASHI...>
Houjou: Higurashi...

3
[Closeup of Houjou.]
<Houjou:    KURUshii no ni ore to Au tame ni MURIshite...>
Houjou: .oO(Even though it was unreasonable with the pain, for the sake of meeting with me she...).

4
[View of Kagome running off into the distance from Houjou's point of view.]
Fx Kagome: (running) vroom... <pyu----...>

lying on his back beside the glowing fragment.]

[Shippou looks up to see the wolves looking down at him.]
Fx wolves: *growl* <Gau Gau>

grasp, in front of a shocked Shippou.]
Fx Kagome: vzzt <Za_>
<Kagome:    SHIKON no kakera!?>
Kagome: .oO(The Shikon fragment!?).
<Shippou:    e...>
Shippou: Eh...



Page 18

[Shippou jumps to Kagome.]
<Shippou:    kagome...>
Shippou: Kagome...
<Kagome:    SHIPPOU-chan.>
Kagome: Shippou-chan.

2
[Closeup side view of Kagome.]
