Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

with no walls, just some richly decorated pillars holding up a roof. Mist
surrounds the whole place, and nothing can be seen beyond the temple.]

Bankotsu: This is...?

[Miroku has made a predictable move on Sango, who has turned Hiraikotsu
slightly to knock his head.]
<Miroku:    susuga no WATASHI mo, koko kara SAKI wa, SANGO no SHIRI o naderu YOYUU wa ari masen shi.>
