Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

<Kikyou:    SEIJOU sugiru...>
Kikyou: abnormally pure...

2
[View of Sango and Miroku.]
<Sango:    dou suru? HOUSHI-sama.>
Sango: What should we do, houshi-sama?
<Miroku:    Itte mi-mashou.>
Miroku: Let's go check it out.
<Miroku:    KI ni nari masu.>
Miroku: I feel uneasy about it.

[View of Inuyasha and Kikyou.]
<Inuyasha:    KIKYOU, omae wa...>
Inuyasha: Kikyou, you...
Kikyou: ......

[Inuyasha notices that village kids arriving a short distance behind him.]
Fx kids: *feet over ground...* <Saku...>
Inuyasha: !

5
[View of the kids, who look sad and desolate.]
<boy:    KIKYOU-sama...>

<Kikyou:    shibaraku ano KO-tachi no soba ni ite yaritai.>
Kikyou: I want to be with those children for a while.
<Kikyou:    soreni...>

<Kikyou:    Ikenai no da.>
Kikyou: I can't.

[Closeup side view of Inuyasha.]
<Inuyasha:    KIKYOU...?>
Inuyasha: Kikyou...?

[Flashback drawing of the Shinidama-chuu vanishing.]
<Kikyou:    INUYASHA... MIta darou,>
Kikyou: {off} Inuyasha... you saw it didn't you,
<Kikyou:    WATASHI no SHINIDAMA-CHUU ga kono CHI no KI ni KOBAmareru no o.>
Kikyou: that my Shinidama-chuu were rejected by the energy in this area.

5
[View of Kikyou.]
<Kikyou:    WATASHI JISHIN mo FUMOTO ni TAtsu no ga yatto datta.>
Kikyou: I myself can just about manage to stand on my feet.

(    It seems that evil humans can get to the mountain, but the Shichinin-tai
are affected, except Suikotsu the doctor with his pure heart. The
Shichinin-tai have human bodies, but only due to the Shikon fragments.
However, Kikyou with a body that's basically an evil construct is affected
- I guess it would not be possible to "purify" Kikyou's body without
destroying it.)

[Miroku (with Shippou on his shoulder) and Inuyasha are rushing along on the ground.]
Fx Miroku: swish swish <Za_ Za_>
<Inuyasha:    oi.>
Inuyasha: Hey.
<Inuyasha:    nande kagome ga KIRARA ni NOtte n-da?>
Inuyasha: Why is Kagome riding with Kirara?
<Miroku:    sorya- omae ni NOritakunai kara darou.>
Miroku: Well, probably because she didn't want to ride with you.



Page 8
1
[Inuyasha looks quizzically at Miroku - Miroku and Shippou both give
Inuyasha a "knowing" expression.]
<Inuyasha:    ore ga nani o shita.>
Inuyasha: What did I do?
<Miroku:    nanimo sezutomo,>
Miroku: Though you did nothing,
<Miroku:    omae to KIKYOU-sama no FUNIKI ga ayashi sugiru.>

<Miroku:    kagome-sama wa, omae no KOKORA ga KIKYOU-sama ni NOKOtte iru to SASsuru, KIZUtsuite iru no da.>
Miroku: While Kagome-sama senses that you still have feelings for Kikyou-sama, she's hurt by it.

[Side view of Miroku, looking away from Inuyasha.]
<Miroku:    shibaraku sottoshite oku koto da na.>
Miroku: You should leave her alone for a while.
<Miroku:    kagome-sama no ATAMA ga HIete kara, KIGEN o toru no ga RIKOU...
** hmm. I don't understand this "kara" here. "made" would make much more sense.
>
Miroku: Until Kagome-sama cools down, not provoking her would be the wise...

4
[Miroku looks up in shock to see Inuyasha has run ahead and is shouting at
Kagome, who is faced away from him.]
Fx Inuyasha: swish <Za_>
<Inuyasha:    kuora, kagome__.>
Inuyasha: Hey you, Kagome!!
<Miroku:    tte, oi_.>
Miroku: Hey, just a sec!
<Shippou:    KIitoran.>

<Inuyasha:    nani Shikato-shite n-da temee_.>
Inuyasha: What're you ignoring me for bitch!

annoyed expressions again.]

<Kagome:    nani yo.>
Kagome: What.

[Kagome calmly watches as Inuyasha is suddenly dived back behind Miroku.]
Fx Inuyasha: whizz <gyun>
Fx Inuyasha: *hide* <koso_>

[Scene change. A bit later, Kagome and Inuyasha are sitting on the ground
together, a short distance apart but both looking ahead. Inuyasha looks
angry and Kagome has an annoyed "here we go again" expression. A distance
behind them, but in ear-shot are Kirara, Sango, Miroku and Shippou.]
<Inuyasha:    Iitai koto ga aru nara, Hakkiri Ie.>
Inuyasha: If you want to say something, then just say it.
<Kagome:    BETSU ni.>
Kagome: Nothing in particular.

[Inuyasha looks at Kagome in annoyance, who is turned away from him.]
<Inuyasha:    OKOtte n-ja nee ka yo.>
Inuyasha: You're angry, aren't you.
<Kagome:    OKOttenai wa yo.>
Kagome: I'm not angry.

2
[Closeup of Inuyasha.]
<Inuyasha:    tonikaku IMA wa Kenka-shite-ru BAAI ja ne- n-da.>
Inuyasha: Anyway, this isn't the time to have a fight.
<Inuyasha:    wakatte n-daro?>

Kagome: I know there's a bond between you and Kikyou.
<Kagome:    dakara KIKYOU o WASUrete nante Ienai.>
Kagome: So I can't ask you to just forget about Kikyou.

3
[Closeup of Kagome with a sad expression.]
<Kagome:    soredemo INUYASHA to ISSHO ni iru tte...>
Kagome: Still Inuyasha, being together with you...
<Kagome:    KImeta no wa, atashi nan dakara.>
Kagome: was my decision.

4
[Inuyasha looks at Kagome.]
<Inuyasha:    kagome...>

5
[Kagome looks up towards the sky, with a sort of sad hopeful smile.]
<Kagome:    dakara sakki no koto da tte,>
Kagome: So about what happened earlier,
<Kagome:    KI ni shinai tsumori...>
Kagome: I was trying not to mind it...

<Kagome:    nande HOttoite kurenai no yo!>

<Kagome:    zutto GAMANshite-ta no ni!!>

nervously and fearfully edging away.]

<Shippou:    INUYASHA ga CHIIsaku MIeru nou.>

[View of Miroku, with Shippou on his shoulder, and Kagome a short distance behind.]

<Miroku:    KIKYOU-sama no Itte ita toori da.>
Miroku: It's just as Kikyou-sama said.



Page 14

[View of the talk rocky mountain, covered with trees.]
Fx birds: *flap wings* <Patata...>

2
[Closeup of Kagome looking up at the mountain.]

Kagome: .oO(It sure is. This Mt Hakurei place...).
<Kagome:    sugoku SUmikitte iru...>
Kagome: .oO(is really serene...).

3
[Sango looks at Kirara in surprise, who seems to be shivering.]
Fx Kirara: *tremble* <Buru_>
<Sango:    dou shita KIRARA.>
Sango: What's up Kirara.

4
[Sango looks on in surprise as Kirara untransforms.]
Fx Kirara: fwoosh... <Shu--->
Fx Kirara: mew... <mi---...>
<Sango:    KIRARA?>
Sango: Kirara?



Page 15

[On Miroku's shoulder, Shippou is unconscious.]

<Miroku:    SHIPPOU...>

[Sango, who is holding Kirara now, looks at Miroku.]
<Sango:    HOUSHI-sama, kore wa...>
Sango: Houshi-sama, this is...
<Miroku:    YAMA no KI ni Aterareta n-deshou.>
Miroku: They're being affected by the mountain.
<Miroku:    TOKU ni SHIPPOU to KIRARA wa HONMONO no YOUKAI desu kara...>
Miroku: In particular, Shippou and Kirara are real Youkai, however...
<Miroku:    kore wa HANYOU no INUYASHA to te...>
Miroku: an Half-Youkai like Inuyasha...

3
[The others watch as Inuyasha purposefully walks forwards.]
Fx Inuyasha: shh <Za_>
Inuyasha: ......
<Kagome:    INUYASHA...>
Kagome: Inuyasha...

4
[Inuyasha walks into a crackling barrier though it doesn't seem to do any
real harm.]
Fx barrier: crackle crackle <Pachi Pachi>
<Inuyasha:    ku_...>
Inuyasha: Ugh...



Page 16
1
[Inuyasha looks at the faintly crackling barrier.]
Fx Inuyasha: shh... <Za...>
<Inuyasha:    korya KEKKAI ja nee ka?>
Inuyasha: This is a barrier isn't it?
<Miroku:    OSOraku...>
Miroku: Most likely...
<Miroku:    SEIIKI o MAMOru tame HArareta mono darou.>
Miroku: Probably put up to protect the sacred precincts.

2
[View of the mountain.]
<Miroku:    soremo YOKOSHIMA mono ya YOUKI o, KATApPASHI kara JOUKAsuru hodo KYOURYOKU na KEKKAI da.
** not quite sure how to translate "katappashi kara" here. "One after the other" doesn't sound right - "in quick succession" sounds ok, but still seems a bit odd.
>
Miroku: {off} Furthermore, this barrier is strong enough to purify evil beings and _youki_ in quick succession.

3
[View of Miroku looking up at the mountain, with Sango and Kagome looking at
him in surprise.]
<Miroku:    NINGEN de aru WATASHI de sura, kono HAGEshii KIYOrakasa wa IGOKOCHI ga WARUi.>
Miroku: Even for a human like me, this intense purity is uncomfortable.
<Sango and Kagome:    e.>
Sango and Kagome: Eh.

4
[Sango turns to Kagome.]
<Sango:    atashi-tachi HEIKI da yo nee.>
Sango: We're okay, aren't we.
<Kagome:    un.>
Kagome: Yeah.

5
[Inuyasha gives Miroku a "look".]
<Inuyasha:    omae, HONTOU ni kegarete n-da naa.>
Inuyasha: You're actually are impure aren't you.
<Miroku:    IMA wa sonna koto Itte iru BAAI dewa nai.>
Miroku: This isn't the time to be talking about that.



Page 17
1
[View of the mountain.]
<Miroku:    arui wa kono SEIIKI no KEKKAI o RIYOUshite,>
Miroku: It might be possible, using the barrier around the sacred precincts,

2
[View of Miroku lookup up at the mountain.]
<Miroku:    NARAKU ga MI o KAKUshite iru kamo shiren to OMOtta ga...>
Miroku: for Naraku to hide himself, is what I had been thinking, but...

3
[Closeup of Inuyasha with a drawing of Naraku behind him.]
<Inuyasha:    aa, MURI da na.>
Inuyasha: Yeah, it's impossible.

4
[Continuation of above frame.]
<Inuyasha:    NARAKU mitee na JAKI no KATAMARI...>
Inuyasha: If a clump of evil like Naraku...
<Inuyasha:    YAMA ni IPPO demo FUmikondara, a_ to iu MA ni JOUKAsare chimau ze.>
Inuyasha: even put a foot onto the mountain, he'd be purified in an instant.

5
[Misty frame.]
<Inuyasha:    NARAKU wa koko ni wa inai.>
Inuyasha: .oO(Naraku isn't here.).

[Scene change. View of the Shichinin-tai on their tank, on a somewhat barren
land. Suikotsu can't been seen, though Renkotsu and Jakotsu can - as well
as Ginkotsu, in the tank.]
Fx tank: clatter clatter <Gata Gata Gata>
<Jakotsu:    yo-- RENKOTSU no ANIKI, doko Iku n-da yo.>
Jakotsu: He-e-ey. Renkotsu no aniki, where are we going.

2
[View of Kohaku ahead.]
Fx Kohaku: *feet over ground* <Saku...>

3
[Jakotsu sites up. Renkotsu calmly looks down at Kohaku.]
<Jakotsu:    n?>
Jakotsu: Hm?
<Jakotsu:    KOHAKU ja nee ka.>
Jakotsu: It's Kohaku isn't it.
<Ginkotsu:    gishi_.>
Ginkotsu: Ge-sh.
<Renkotsu:    oMUKAe da.>
Renkotsu: We're here.

4
[View of Renkotsu looking off into the distance.]
<Renkotsu:    saa, OO-ANIKI to goTAIMEN da ze.>
Renkotsu: Now, we're to meet with Oo-aniki.
<Renkotsu:    kore de SHICHININ-TAI SEIzoroi tte wake da.>
