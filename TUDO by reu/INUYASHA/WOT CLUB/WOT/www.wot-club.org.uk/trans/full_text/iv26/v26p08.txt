Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

[The boy and Kagome come over to look at the object that was the center of
the barrier.]

4
[Shintarou looks down at the object.]
<Shintarou:    oDOU ni OSAmerarete ita DOKKO...>
Shintarou: It's the _dokko_ that was installed in the shrine...

(    Not really possible to translate "dokko" but it's an iron tool used in
Buddhism, sometimes for combat.)

5
[View of Kagome and Miroku.]
<Shintarou:    HAKUSHIN-SHOUNIN-sama ga SEIZEN, TSUKAtte orareta BUTSUGU da.>
Shintarou: When Hakushin-shounin-sama was alive, it's the _butsugu_ he used.

(    "Butsugu" is "Buddhist altar equipment", according to my dictionary.
Basically a tool to help concentrate one's power, probably.)

3
[Closeup of Bankotsu smiling nastily.]
<Bankotsu:    WARUi kedo na, ore mo CHOUSHI YOku natte kita ze.>
Bankotsu: Sorry but, I'm also feeling better.
<Bankotsu:    KEKKAI to yara ga YABUreta okage de na.>
Bankotsu: Thanks to that barrier thing being busted.

4
[Closeup of Inuyasha looking determined, but also a bit worried.]

Fx Inuyasha: *stir of power...* <Zawa...>
