Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

<Title:    BANKOTSU>
Title: Bankotsu
 
(    "Ban kotsu" would translate as "barbarian bones", though as single word it
means "brute courage" or "recklessness".)

[Long distance view of what appears to be a young man in fairly rich looking
clothes, though suitable for combat. He has a long braid of hair reaching
down to his waist. He's holding a piece of paper in front of him with a
writing brush, and has several crumpled up pieces of paper on the ground in
front of him. He's sitting on a grassy hill ledge, faces towards a castle
on the other side of the valley.]
<Bankotsu:    u~~~~n.>
Bankotsu: U~n~n~n.

[Closeup of some ink stained hands crumpling up the paper.]
<Bankotsu:    a---_.>
Bankotsu: Ahhh!
<Bankotsu:    Dame da!>
Bankotsu: No damn good!
Fx paper: *crush* <Gusha>

[View of Bankotsu from the front, covering his face in despair. Behind him
is Kohaku.]

Bankotsu: Huh?

[The Shichinin-tai tank is coming up the hill.]

on board.]

Bankotsu: "We'll be coming to repay that old debt...

(    Statements like "repay a debt" ("return with interest" kind of thing) are
often used when plotting revenge. So, an alternative translation would be
"We'll be coming to get revenge for what happend long ago".)

face a bit.]
<Bankotsu:    KUBIARAtte MAtte yagare.>

(    "Wash your necks" basically means "prepare to be beheaded".)
