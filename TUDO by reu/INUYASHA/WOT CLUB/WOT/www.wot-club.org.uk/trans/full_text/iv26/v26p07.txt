Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

[Inuyasha is beside a river, looking at it. Miroku, Kagome and Shippou are
standing a bit behind him.]
<Miroku:    dou da INUYASHA.>
Miroku: Well, Inuyasha?
Inuyasha: ......

[Closeup of Inuyasha.]
<Inuyasha:    CHIGAu na.>
Inuyasha: It's different.
<Inuyasha:    konna... NUMA no NIOi ja nakatta.>

[Inuyasha thinks back on the recent Naraku-puppet.]
<Inuyasha:    NARAKU no KUGUTSU ga HASshite ita...>
Inuyasha: .oO(The Naraku _kugutsu_ gave out...).
<Inuyasha:    MIZU to... HANA no NIOi.>

[Sango arrives on Kirara, coming down from the sky.]
Fx Kirara: swish <Za_>
<Sango:    minna...>
Sango: Hey...

3
[Miroku and Kagome look up.]
<Miroku:    SANGO...>
Miroku: Sango...
<Kagome:    dou datta? SANGO-chan.>
Kagome: How was it, Sango-chan?

4
[Sango is now on the ground.]
<Sango:    Dame da. HAKUREI-ZAN no KEKKAI...>
Sango: It's no good. The barrier around Mt Hakurei...
<Sango:    IZEN yori TSUYOku natte-ru.>
Sango: has gotten stronger than before.
<Miroku:    yahari... FUmiKOmu no wa MURI ka.>
Miroku: So... it'll be impossible to break in after all, huh.

[View of Inuyasha, moving to leave.]
<Inuyasha:    naninishitatte, NARAKU no CHIKAku made KIta koto wa MACHIGAinee n-da.>
Inuyasha: Anyway, there's no mistaking that Naraku has been near here.
<Inuyasha:    YAMA no MAWAri no MIZUBE o KATApPASHIkara ataru zo.>
Inuyasha: Let's try every single place beside water around the mountain.
Fx Inuyasha: shh <Za_>

[Scene change. Misty frame.]

[View of a small fishing village beside a lake.]
Fx water: slish... <Za...>

4
[Misty frame.]
<boy:    TANOmu_, FUNE o...>
boy: {off} Please! [Lend me] a boat...
<villager:    Dame da DAsenee yo.>
villager: {off} No way I'm handing it over.

5
[A small boy (10 at most) is standing on the shore around the talk,
addressing 3 men, who are working on some fishing nets.]
<boy:    demo, mou HANTSUKI mo oyaji ga KAEran no da.>
boy: But, it's already been half a month since dad left.
<boy:    HIJIRI-JIMA de nanika atta n-da.>
boy: Something happened at Hijiri Island.
<villager:    shikashi naa.>
villager: But, you know...

[View of two villagers discussing it.]
<villager#1:    HIJIRI-JIMA wa SEIIKI da.>
villager#1: Hijiri Island is sacred ground.
<villager#1:    washi-ra ga Itta n-ja Bachi ga Ataru zo.>
villager#1: If we went, we'd be cursed.
<villager#2:    naa.>
villager#2: Yeah.

2
[Closeup of the boy.]
<boy:    dakara FUNE dake KAshite kurereba ii.>
boy: You just have to lend me a boat.
<boy:    ore hitori de Iku kara...>
boy: I'll go alone, so...

3
[The villagers look off at something.]
<Inuyasha:    ou, IMA SEIIKI to ka Itta na.>
Inuyasha: {off} Hey, you just said something about sacred grounds didn't you.

4
[Inuyasha and the others are there.]
<Miroku:    HANASHI o KIkasete morae masen ka.>
Miroku: Could you let us hear your story please.



Page 6
1
[Scene change. View of an island in the middle of the lake, surrounded by mist.]
<boy:    kono MIZUUMI no NAKA hodo ni SHIMA ga aru.>
boy: {off} Near the middle of this lake is an island.
<boy:    ZOKUJIN ga TAchiIru koto wa dekinai.>
boy: Ordinary people cannot enter.

2
[The boy is seated in the middle of a large room, with 3 girls behind him
(his sisters) talking to Miroku and Inuyasha in front of him. Kagome and
Sango are near the entrance to the room.]
<boy:    EN ga atte, kono IE no DANSHI dake ga HIJIRI-JIMA ni WATAri,
** not quite sure how to translate "en ga aru". Guessing.
>
boy: By chance, the males of this family alone are allowed to cross to Hijiri Island,
<boy:    HAKUSHIN SHOUNIN-sama no oSEWA o suru koto o YURUsarete iru.>
boy: to take care of Hakushin Shounin-sama.
<Miroku:    HAKUSHIN SHOUNIN-sama...?>
Miroku: Hakushin-shounin-sama...?

(    "Hakushin" means "white heart" and "shounin" is a title for a holy priest
or saint type person.)

3
[View of the boy, and Inuyasha and Miroku.]
<boy:    mou HYAKUNEN mo MAE no ERAi oBOU-sama de,>
boy: A great priest from over 100 years ago,
<boy:    IkiBOTOKE-sama to nararete, SHIMA no oDOU ni MAtsurarete iru no da.>
boy: who, becoming a living Buddha, was enshrined in the small temple on the island.
<Inuyasha:    IkiBOTOKE...>
Inuyasha: Living Buddha...?
<Miroku:    SOKUSHINBUTSU no koto deshou ka.>
Miroku: Most likely talking about a "Sokushinbutsu".

4
[Closeup of Miroku.]
<Miroku:    TOKU no TAKAi SOURYO ga SEIZEN kara KOKUMOTSU o TAchi,>
Miroku: A saint-like priest, who while still alive, abstains all food,
<Miroku:    NIKUTAI o MIIRA-KA sase-nagara NYUUMETSUsuru to iu...>
Miroku: and enters nirvana while their flesh mummifies...

(    The Miroku "Sokushinbutsu" is describing, is sometimes called a "living
Buddha" (someone who is considered to have attained Buddhahood while still
alive), of which there are quite a number around Japan.)

[View of Miroku and Inuyasha.]
<Inuyasha:    HAYAi HANASHI ga BOUZU no HIMONO ka yo.>
Inuyasha: In other words, you get a raisin-priest, eh.
<Miroku:    omae, Bachi ga Ataru zo.>
Miroku: You'll be cursed.

(    Inuyasha says "bouzu no himono", where "bouzu" is crude slang for a priest,
and "himono" is "dried food". No wonder Miroku thinks Inuyasha'll get some
divine punishment...)

2
[View of Kagome and the boy.]
<Kagome:    nee, sakki otou-san ga KAEtte konai tte.>
Kagome: Say, earlier you said that your father hadn't come back.

3
[View of the boy, looking a bit depressed.]
<boy:    un,>
boy: Yeah,
<boy:    mou HANTSUKI ni naru.>
boy: it's been half a month.
<boy:    YOUSU o MI ni Ikitai no daga...>
boy: I want to check up on him, but...

4
[The boy's sisters talk to him.]
<sister#1:    SHINTAROU, omae hitori dewa MURI desu.>
sister#1: Shintarou, it's impossible by yourself.
<Shintarou:    ANE-UE-tachi...>
Shintarou: Elder sisters...

5
[View of the sisters talking together, looking a bit worried.]
<sister#1:    demo, otou-sama ga SHINPAI da wa.>
sister#1: But, I'm worried about otou-sama.
<sister#2:    MURA no HITO wa TATAri o OSOrete iru shi...>
sister#2: And the villagers are worried about the curse...
<sister#3:    KOMAtta wa nee.>
sister#3: It's a real problem, isn't it.

6
[Kagome talks to Inuyasha.]
<Kagome:    Itte miyou? INUYASHA.>
Kagome: Shall we go, Inuyasha?
<Inuyasha:    aa,>
Inuyasha: Yeah,
<Inuyasha:    SEIIKI tte no ga dounimo hikkakaru shi na.
** "hikkakaru" not quite sure what Inuyasha means here 
>
Inuyasha: there's gotta be something about this sacred grounds.

[Closeup of the boy.]
<Shintarou:    ore ga MIZUSAKIANNAI o shou.>
Shintarou: I'll be the pilot.
<Shintarou:    HIJIRI-JIMA no mawari wa itsumo KIRI ga tachikomete ite KIKEN na no da.>
Shintarou: It's dangerous as there's always a fog hanging over Hijiri Island.

2
[The three pretty sisters look imploringly at Miroku (and the others).]
<sister#1:    OTOUTO o yoroshiku oNEGAi itashi masu.>
sister#1: Please take good care of our brother.
<sister#2:    SHINTAROU wa kono IE de tatta hitori no OTOKO no KO na no desu.>
sister#2: Shintarou is the only son in this family.
<Miroku:    sore wa KOKOROBOSOi koto desu na.>
Miroku: That must be lonely.

3
[Miroku clasps the hand of one of the sisters, and the background has gone romantic.]
<Miroku:    WATASHI de yokereba,>
Miroku: If you don't mind,
<Miroku:    ANEUE-sama-tachi ni DANSHI o Umasete sashi age mashou.>
Miroku: I shall let you sisters bear some sons.
Fx Miroku: (hand) *squeeze* <gyu_>

4
[Sango has whacked Miroku on the head, while Kagome and Inuyasha leave with
expressions clearly indicating they expected nothing else, but are rather
annoyed still.]
Fx Miroku: clunk... <mishi...>
<sister:    ano~>
sister: Umm...
<sister:    HONTOU ni OTOUTO o omakaseshite, DAIJOUBU na no deshou ka.>
sister: Is it really okay to leave our brother in your care?

[Scene change. View of some mist.]

2
[Shippou, Miroku, Inuyasha, Shintarou and Kagome are in a small boat. Sango
is following on Kirara.]
Fx water: slish... <Za...>
<Shintarou:    HAKUSHIN SHOUNIN-sama wa, SEIZEN kara, TAIHEN na HOURIKI o MOtte orarete,>
Shintarou: While Hakushin-shounin-sama was still alive, he had very strong _houriki_ (Buddhist powers),
<Shintarou:    kono TOCHI no SHUU o SUKUtte ita sou nan da.>
Shintarou: and saved a great many people in this area, it's said.
<Miroku:    haa.>
Miroku: I see.

3
[View of Mt Hakurei in the distance.]
<Shintarou:    hora, asoko ni MIeru HAKUREI-ZAN...>
Shintarou: Look, you can see Mt Hakurei-san over there...
<Shintarou:    asoko FUMOTO ni oKIYOmeDOKORO to iu no ga aru.>
Shintarou: At the base of the mountain is the purification place.

4
[Kagome talks to the boy.]
<Kagome:    oKIYOmeDOKORO tte...>
Kagome: "Purification place"...?
<Shintarou:    SHOUNIN-sama ga HIRAita oTERA de...>
Shintarou: It's where the shounin-sama opened a temple...

5
[View of Kagome.]
<Shintarou:    soko ni MOUdereba, donna TSUMI mo KIYOmerareru to iu BASHO nan-da.>
Shintarou: It's the place where if you pray there, any sins can be purified.

Sango: Yeah...
<Sango:    IMA, KEKKAI o HAtte iru NANIMONOka ga iru tte koto da yo ne.>
Sango: Right now, there is someone holding up that barrier.
<Sango:    dakedo...>
Sango: However...



Page 11

[Closeup of Sango.]
<Sango:    SUKUnakutomo, NARAKU no HAtta MONO ja nai.>
Sango: at least it's not something Naraku put up.
<Sango:    ano KEKKAI wa marude GYAKU no...>
Sango: That barrier is like the opposite [of what he'd do]...

2
[Closeup side view of Kagome thinking.]
<Kagome:    sou, are wa...>
Kagome: .oO(Yes, it's...).
<Kagome:    marude SEIJIN ga HAtte iru... mitai na...>
Kagome: .oO(as if a holy person put it up... it seems...).
<Kagome:    demo, nan no tame ni...>
Kagome: .oO(But, for what purpose...).

Shintarou: If the boat scrapes against a rock...
Fx sound: {comically} *scrape* <gori_>
