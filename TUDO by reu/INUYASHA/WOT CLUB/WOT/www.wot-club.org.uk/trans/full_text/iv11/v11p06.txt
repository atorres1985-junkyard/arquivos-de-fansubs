Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

<Myouga:    OSHOU wa are ni KOKORO o AYATSUrarete oru.>
Myouga: The oshou is being mind-controlled with them.

(    'kokochuu' is not a word in the dictionary, that I can find. The word is
comprised of 3 kanji which literally read as "ring worm", "tsubo pot" and
"insect". The ring worms are probably the "hairs" that occationaly come out
of Mushin's mouth. Another meaning of "tsubo pot" is a pressure point, or a
focus point. I don't understand the meaning of the "insect" part.)

Myouga: If we steal the tsubo pot from that person, and point it at Mushin-oshou...

2
[Kagome looks at Myouga.]
<Myouga:    KOKOCHUU wa KARADA o HANAre TSUBO ni MODOru hazu.>
Myouga: the Kokochuu should leave his body and return to the tsubo pot.

[Closeup of Miroku.]

4
[Kagome gets up to move off, carrying her bow.]
<Kagome:    wakatta! TSUBO TSUKAi o SAGAshi ni Iku wa yo, MYOUGA-jii-chan.>
Kagome: I got it! Myouga-jii-chan, let's go find that tsubo pot user.
