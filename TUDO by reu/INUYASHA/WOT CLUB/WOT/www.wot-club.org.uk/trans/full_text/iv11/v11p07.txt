Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

<Shippou:    KEshiTOnda.>

[Misty frame.]

<Sango:    AMATA Utte KISETSU shite-ru dake daro.>

<Shippou:    OSOi nou.>
Shippou: It's been a while.
<Kagome:    KIZU o NUu tte Itte-ta kara,>
Kagome: He said he's going to sew the wound,
<Kagome:    JIKAN kakaru no yo.>

Page 13

[Mushin slides open a door, holding a jar.]
Fx door: *slide...* <Kara...>
<Mushin:    _taku  MUCHA shio-tte...>
Mushin: Sheesh, he's so reckless...

2
[Closeup of Kagome and Inuyasha.]
Inuyasha: !
<Kagome:    OSHOU-san.>
Kagome: Oshou-san.

3
[Kagome, with Shippou on her shoulder, come over to talk to the priest.]
<Kagome:    MIROKU-sama wa!?>
Kagome: Hows Miroku-sama!?
<Mushin:    NEto-ru.>
Mushin: He's asleep.

4
[Closeup of Mushin, looking serious.]
<Mushin:    INUYASHA... to ka Iu-ta na.>
Mushin: You're... Inuyasha, aren't you.
<Mushin:    chotto KOi.>
Mushin: Follow me for a bit.

5
[Inuyasha looks serious.]

6
[Inuyasha and Mushin, who's taking a drink from the jar are now alone.]
<Inuyasha:    ou BOUZU, KAZAANA no KIZU chanto NAOshita n-darou na.>
Inuyasha: Hey priest, you have treated the cut in the Air Rip properly, haven't you?
Mushin: ......



Page 14

[Closeup of Mushin turning around to look at Inuyasha.]
<Mushin:    NARAKU o TAOse.>
Mushin: Destroy Naraku.
<Mushin:    IKKOKU mo HAYAku.>

<Inuyasha:    dou iu koto dei.>
Inuyasha: Whadda you mean?

3
[Side view of Mushin, sighing.]
<Mushin:    DEKIru-dake no TEAte wa shita ga na,>
Mushin: I did treat him as best I could,
<Mushin:    sude ni... KAZAANA wa HIROgatto-tta.>
Mushin: but... the Air Rip has already widened.

4
[Inuyasha takes this in.]

5
[Closeup of Inuyasha looking somewhat sad.]
<Inuyasha:    JUMYOU ga CHIJImatta... tte koto ka?>
Inuyasha: So you're saying that... his life span has shortened?

6
[Inside, Kagome and Sango are sitting on either side of Miroku, with Shippou
and the tanuki around too. Miroku is asleep on a futon (pallet).]
<Kagome:    MIROKU-sama...>
Kagome: Miroku-sama...



Page 15
1
[Closeup of Sango looking a bit sad.]
<Sango:    HOUSHI-sama... KOKORO ga TSUYOi HITO nan-da ne.>
Sango: Houshi-sama... is strong in the mind, isn't he.

(    Sango just says "houshi-sama", where houshi is Miroku's title as a
low-level Buddhist priest. Considering they're a group, Sango is being
overly formal, and is addressing him like he was a stranger. This perhaps
suggests that Sango does not trust Miroku that much. It could also be
argued that Kagome is being a bit more formal than she could saying
"Miroku-sama", and that this puts a bit of "distance" between them,
indicating that she doesn't quite entirely trust Miroku either.)

2
[Closeup of Miroku.]
<Sango:    nande itsumo...>
Sango: All the time...
<Sango:    annan ni AKAruku shiterareru n-darou.>
Sango: he kept up a cheerful expression.

[Closeup of Kagome.]

[Long view of the ground around Miroku.]
<Kagome:    MAIICHI... FUAN de tamaranai n-da wa...>
Kagome: .oO(everyday... hopelessly depressing...).

5
[Misty frame.]

6
[Inuyasha is looking at Mushin, who has his back to Inuyasha.]
<Inuyasha:    ato NANNEN...>
Inuyasha: For how many years...
<Inuyasha:    MIROKU wa Ikirareru?>
Inuyasha: will Miroku live?
<Mushin:    wakaran.>
Mushin: No idea.
<Mushin:    tonikaku...>
Mushin: Anyhow...



Page 15
1
[Mushin turns to look at Inuyasha, and behind him is a drawing of Naraku.]
<Mushin:    MIROKU no TE no KAZAANA wa...>
Mushin: The Air Rip in Miroku's hand...
<Mushin:    YOUKAI NARAKU no NOROi de UKAtareta mono.
** ukatareta = ??
>
Mushin: is a due to the Youkai Naraku's curse.

2
[Continuation of above frame.]
<Mushin:    sunawachi NARAKU sae TAOseba...>
Mushin: In other words, if you can destroy Naraku...

Kagome: Miroku-sama!

[Closeup of Miroku.]
<Miroku:    WATASHI wa...>
Miroku: I'm...
<Miroku:    Ikite iru no ka.>
Miroku: still alive, huh.

4
[Closeup of Kagome, who has pools of tears in her eyes.]
<Kagome:    mou DAIJOUBU yo.>
Kagome: You're fine now.
<Kagome:    OSHOU-san ga NAOsite kureta wa.>
Kagome: The Oshou-san treated you.

5
[Miroku holds up his sealed right hand, and looks at it.]
<Miroku:    sou... desu ka...>
Miroku: I... see...

6
[Miroku suddenly looks surprised.]
<Miroku:    a...>
Miroku: Ah...!

7
[Miroku moves his arm over towards Kagome, and Sango leans over Miroku to
take a look.]

<Kagome:    TE ga douka shita!?>
Kagome: What's with the hand!?

[Miroku has a sort of peaceful look on his face as his other hand has
reached over and is feeling Sango's behind. Everyone else has a sort-of
surprised look.]
Fx Sango: *snap* <pishi_>
Fx Miroku: (Sango) caress-caress <nade nade>



Page 17

[Sango has clobbered Miroku on the head with a bowl, and Miroku is rather
frozen in position. Kagome has a sort of annoyed, sort of unsurprised
expression. Inuyasha and Mushin has also just entered.]
<tanuki:    MIROKU no danna...>
tanuki: Master Miroku...
Fx tanuki: sigh <fu->
Fx Sango: *strained breathing* <ha~ ha~>
Fx Miroku: clunk... <mishi...>
<Kagome:    konna TOKI made Sekuhara o...>
Kagome: Sexual harassment even at a time like this..
<Inuyasha:    shibaraku SHInanee to OMOu n-da ga...>
Inuyasha: I thought he wouldn't die quietly, but...
<Mushin:    umu.>
Mushin: Hmm.

2
[Misty frame.]
Fx sound: rustle... <Sawa...>

3
[A Saimyoushou insect flies along, looking like it's about to land.]
Fx saimyoushou: buzz-buzz... <Bubu...>

4
[The insect lands on Naraku's outstretched hand - he is still disguised as
the young master of that castle.]
<Naraku:    MODOtta no wa IPPIKI dake...>
Naraku: Only one of you came back...
<Naraku:    HOKA wa SHInda ka...>
Naraku: The rest are dead huh...

5
[Naraku looks at the insect.]

2
[Closeup side view of Naraku looking quite troubled.]
<Naraku:    ...tonareba HYAPPIKI no YOUKAI o sashimukeru yori...
** Is Naraku saying he wouldn't be able to pursuade hoards of youkai to attack Inuyasha anymore, or that he can't send more at once, or what?
>
Naraku: .oO(...In which case, demanding to send more than 100 Youkai...).
<Naraku:    KOROsenu IPPIKI o HANAtsu no ga TOKUSOKU...>
Naraku: .oO(when only one came back alive...).

3
[Naraku looks over to the side, where there is a translucent screen, through
which the shadow of somebody can be seen.]
shadow: ......
<Naraku:    kisama o TSUKAu TOKI ga kita.>
Naraku: The time's come to use you.
<Naraku:    mou KARADA wa OMOi doori ni UGOku darou na.>
Naraku: Do you remember how to move your body again?

4
[Closeup of the shadow, which looks like that of a young boy's...]
<shadow:    hai...>
shadow: Yes...
<shadow:    NARAKU-sama...>
shadow: Naraku-sama...
