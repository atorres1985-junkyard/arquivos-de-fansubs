Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

[Inuyasha and Miroku continue their talk, with Miroku looking at his hand.]
<Inuyasha:    omae no KAZAANA o FUUjiru koto ni wa, mamma to SEIKOUshite-tte wake da.
** this is the only thing I could think of that seemed sensible, though Miroku's next line doesn't seem to quite follow on.
>
Inuyasha: Because I forcibly sealed your Air Rip, it turned out reasonably successful.
Miroku: ......

2
[Closeup of Miroku.]
<Miroku:    kono KI ni mata nanika SHIKAkete kuru deshou na.>
Miroku: He'll probably use this chance to set some more traps.

3
[Kagome and Sango (in her casual clothes) are standing near an Onsen (hot
springs), and nearby Shippou is looking off at something (the campfire from
the glow) off-screen. Kagome is moving to take off her top.]
<Shippou:    nanka Majime ni HANAshi atto-ru zo.>
Shippou: They seem to be having a serious conversation.
<Kagome:    soo?>
Kagome: Really?
<Kagome:    ja IMA no uchi ni ONSEN ni...>
Kagome: Then, while they're at it, let's get in the Onsen...
Fx Kagome: (clothes) rustle <sa sa_>
<Sango:    HOUSHI-sama wa tomokaku...
** hmm, does this tomokaku mean something like Sango thinks/expects that Miroku might try?
>
Sango: That the houshi-sama would, is to be expected...
<Sango:    INUYASHA mo nozoki to ka sun-no?>
Sango: but does Inuyasha peep too?

[Kagome is now in the water, while Sango is moving to undress and get in,
while looking at Kagome.]

<Kagome:    Kakko-tsukete-ru kara.>
Kagome: He acts like he doesn't care.
<Sango:    MIraretai no ka.>
Sango: .oO(Do you want him to look?).

(    Sango uses 'houshi-sama' to refer to Miroku. Back in volume 6.2, when
Kagome was in the Onsen, Inuyasha said he had no interest in peeking.
Kagome was annoyed because he thinks that, even though he thinks Kikyou is
beautiful and that Kagome looks like Kikyou.)
