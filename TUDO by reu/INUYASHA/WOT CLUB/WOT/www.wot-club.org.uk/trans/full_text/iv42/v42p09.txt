Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

quietly as Inuyasha's predictable reaction.]

<Inuyasha:    daitai, itsu datte ore wa ZENZEN WARUkunee zo!>

<Sango:    IMAGORO, SESSHOUMARU ga Kushamari-shite-ru n-ja nai?>
Sango: Maybe right now, Sesshoumaru is sneezing?

(    It's a saying that you sneeze when people talk about you behind your back.)

5
[Closeup of Jaken, glancing off at Sesshoumaru.]
<Jaken:    nanka SESSHOUMARU-sama ga shitasou datta kara,>

Jaken: I got them instead.
Fx Jaken: *glance* <chira_>

6
