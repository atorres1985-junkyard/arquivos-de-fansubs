Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

<Jaken:    KATANA no YOUKI ni hikarete DEteKIta ka.>

<Toutousai:    MEIDOU ga HIRAita no sa.>
Toutousai: The Meidou has opened.
<Jaken:    MEIDOU!?>
Jaken: Meidou!?

(    Meidou basically means "the path to the realm of the dead", though
literally translates as "dark path".)

2

slicing it in two.]
Fx Oni: fwip <Ba_>

<Toutousai:    ONI no KARADA ga ano YO ni MOtte kareta no sa.>
Toutousai: Part of the Oni's body was taken to the next world.
<Jaken:    ano YO?>
Jaken: The next world?

(    "The next world" basically means "afterlife" or "realm of the dead".)

3
[View of the Oni's body.]
<Toutousai:    mada MIKKAZUKI TEIDO no SAkeME daga na.>
Toutousai: That rent was only at the level of a crescent moon though.
<Toutousai:    UDE ga agaru dake EN ni CHIKAzuite...>
Toutousai: As you improve, it'll become closer to a circle...
<Toutousai:    izure wa TEKI no KARADA o marugoto ano YO ni OKUreru zo.>
Toutousai: and eventually, will be able to send the entire body of the enemy to the next world.

4
[Side view of Sesshoumaru.]
<Sesshoumaru:    MEIDOU o KIriHIRAku WAZA... ka.>
Sesshoumaru: The ability to cut open the path to the next world... huh.

5
[Closeup of Toutousai.]
<Toutousai:    TENSEIGA wa motomoto...>
Toutousai: After all, Tenseiga is originally...
<Toutousai:    ano YO to kono YO o tsunagu KATANA dakara na.>
Toutousai: a sword that connects the next world, with this one.



Page 14
1
[Drawing of the "pall-bearers" who come when someone dies.]
<Toutousai:    dakara koso TENSEIGA o MOtsu MONO ni wa ano YO no TSUKAi ga MIe,>
Toutousai: That is exactly why the one who holds Tenseiga can see the pall-bearers from the next world,
<Toutousai:    sore o KIru koto de, SHISHA o kono YO ni YObiMODOsu koto mo KANOU.>
Toutousai: and by cutting them, it is possible for the dead to be brought back from the next world.

2
[View of Rin, with Jaken looking at her.]
<Rin:    hee~>
Rin: Wow...
<Jaken:    tte...>
Jaken: .oO(Hey...).
<Jaken:    omae ga YOMIGAEri DAIICHIGOU daro- ga_!>
Jaken: .oO(You were the first one brought back though!).

3
[Flashback of the dark arc.]
<Toutousai:    GYAKU ni, ano YO e no MICHI... MEIDOU o KIri,>
Toutousai: {voice over} Conversely, by cutting the path to the next world... the Meidou,
<Toutousai:    soko kara MOJIdoori TEKI o MEIKAI ni OKUru...>
Toutousai: from there, enemies are literally sent to the next world...

4
[View of Toutousai looking at Sesshoumaru.]
<Toutousai:    sore ga TENSEIGA no TATAKAi KATA da.>
Toutousai: That is how to use Tenseiga for battle.
<Toutousai:    soshite omee ga sakki TSUKAtta no ga...>
Toutousai: And what you used earlier was...



Page 15
1
[Closeup side view of Toutousai.]
<Toutousai:    MEIDOU ZANGETSU HA...>
Toutousai: the Meidou Zangetsu Ha.

(    Meidou is "path to the next world" as before. Zangetsu here means "morning
moon" (a moon visible in the morning), though with different kanji
"zangetsu" can be "cutting moon". I don't know if there is any special
meaning to "morning moon" here - maybe it's just supposed to be a poetic
use of moon. Finally, "ha" is the same "ha" in Bakuryuuha, namely
"destruction" and often used in "special moves".)

2
[View of Sesshoumaru.]



Page 16
1
[View of Toutousai looking annoyed.]
<Toutousai:    ...nishitemo SESSHOUMARU no YAROU...>
Toutousai: .oO(...Still, that damn Sesshoumaru...).
<Toutousai:    ikinari TSUKAkonashi yagatte.>
Toutousai: .oO(mastered it instantly.).
<Toutousai:    aikawarazu KAWAIGE ga nai tte ka...>
Toutousai: .oO(As always, he doesn't have a naieve side...).

(    This may seem strange, but I think what Toutousai means here is Sesshoumaru
didn't have to struggle - he seemingly did it all effortlessly, and doesn't
need to ask for help. Unlike Inuyasha for example.)

2
[View of Sesshoumaru.]
<Toutousai:    ma, TENSEIGA ga MITOmete n-dakara shouganee kedo na...>
Toutousai: .oO(Well, since Tenseiga had acknowledged him, it can't be helped...).

3
[Closeup of Sesshoumaru.]

4
[FlashBack Flashback to Mouryoumaru.
<Mouryoumaru:    ano Baka na ONNA...>
Mouryoumaru: That foolish woman...
<Mouryoumaru:    mattaku no MUDAJI ni datta to iu koto da.>
Mouryoumaru: had a completely wasted death.
EndFlashBack]

[Flashback drawing of when Sesshoumaru saw Kagura die.]



Page 17

[Closeup side view of Sesshoumaru.]
<Sesshoumaru:    MUDAJI ni ka dou ka wa...>
Sesshoumaru: .oO(Whether it was wasted or not...).
<Sesshoumaru:    WATASHI ga KImeru KOTO da.>
Sesshoumaru: .oO(will be decided by me.).

2
[Sesshoumaru glances back at Toutousai.]
<Sesshoumaru:    TOUTOUSAI.>
Sesshoumaru: Toutousai.
<Toutousai:    a?>
Toutousai: Yeah?

3
[View of Sesshoumaru.]
<Sesshoumaru:    TATAKAi no TENSEIGA...>
Sesshoumaru: I definitely accept...
<Sesshoumaru:    TASHIka ni MORAi Uketa.>
Sesshoumaru: Tenseiga's battleworthyness.



Page 18

[A sudden gust of wind blows from behind Sesshoumaru.]
Fx air: swish <Zaa...>

[Jaken and Rin look around.]
<Rin:    KAZE...>
Rin: Wind...

[White frame.]
<Sesshoumaru:    Iku zo.>
Sesshoumaru: {off} Let's go.
