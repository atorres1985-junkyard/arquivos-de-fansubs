Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

[Dark frame.]
<Miroku:    HITOBAN de YAMA ga KAreta?>
Miroku: {off} In one night the mountain withered?

2
[Miroku, Sango, Inuyasha and Kagome are talking to some villagers.]
<villager:    aa, ano toori...>
villager: Yeah, as you can see...

3
[View of a mountain valley, but the forest on both sides has gone brown.]
<villager:    YOUKAI no DOKU ni yarareta n-da.>
villager: {off} It was from the Youkai's poison.

4
[View of some villagers.]
<villager:    NIKOSEN no shiwaza ni CHIGAinee.>
villager: It's gotta be Nikosen's work.

5
[View of Inuyasha and Kagome.]
<Kagome:    NIKOSEN...?>
Kagome: Nikosen...?

(    Nikosen roughly translates as "doubly withered hermit".)

Kagome with Inuyasha in human form.]

[Scene change. View of Kagome walking over some dried branches.]
Fx branch: snap <Paki_>

2
[Miroku, Sango, Kagome and Shippou are looking around the devestated area.
There is no greenery at all and the remains of trees have fallen apart.]
Fx branch: snap <Paki>
<Kagome:    kore, KI...?>
Kagome: These are trees...?
<Sango:    Boroboro da.>
Sango: They're in ruins.
<Miroku:    SATO no MONO no HANASHI dewa...>
Miroku: According to what the villagers said...

3
[Closeup of Miroku.]
<Miroku:    NIKOSEN to iu YOUKAI wa JUMOKU no SEIKI o KUu n-da sou desu.>
Miroku: it seems that this Youkai called Nikosen eats the life energy of plants.
<Miroku:    nandemo OOMUKASHI wa SENNIN datta to ka...>
Miroku: Anyway, he was originally a sennin from a long time ago, apparantly...

4
[View of Kagome and Sango.]
<Kagome:    moto SENNIN...>
Kagome: Originally a sennin...
<Sango:    sou iu YOUKAI mo iru n-da yo.>
Sango: There are Youkai like that too.

(    A "sennin" is basically a wise mountain hermit. I guess one could turn into
a Youkai by going to the "dark side" and consuming enough energy,
especially evil energy.)

5
[Closeup of Kagome suddenly looking shocked.]
Fx Kagome: *stir of energy* <Zawa...>
Kagome: !

[View of Kagome looking to the side, and Inuyasha looking at her in surprise.]

Inuyasha: Wha-at!?

[View of Sango and Miroku.]
<Miroku:    NARAKU ga KAKAwatte-ru tte koto!?>
Miroku: Meaning Naraku is involved!?
<Sango:    INUYASHA, NARAKU no NIOi wa!?>
Sango: Inuyasha, what about Naraku's scent!?

3
[View of Inuyasha.]
Inuyasha: ......
<Inuyasha:    kagome, KEHAI no HOU ni ANNAIshi na.>
Inuyasha: Kagome, show me which direction the fragment is in.

4
[Kagome talks to Inuyasha.]
<Kagome:    Dame yo, HANArenakya.>
Kagome: No way, we gotta stay together.
<Inuyasha:    aa!?>
Inuyasha: Haah!?

5
[Closeup of Kagome.]
<Kagome:    HI ga Ochiru MAE ni YAMA o DEnai to.>
Kagome: We've got to get down from the mountain by the end of the day.
<Kagome:    kyou wa SAKU no HI desho?>
Kagome: Today's a new moon, right?

[View of Sango and Miroku.]

Miroku: The night Inuyasha becomes human huh.
<Miroku:    sore dewa SHIKATA ari masen na.>
Miroku: I guess it can't be helped.

2
[Shippou has come over and pinched Inuyasha's nose.]
<Shippou:    sate wa INUYASHA,>
Shippou: So then Inuyasha,
<Shippou:    sude ni HANA ga KIkanaku natto-ru na_.>

Miroku: Let's come back tomorrow, Inuyasha.

4
[Scene change. View of a river gorge as the sky starts to darken.]
<Inuyasha:    _taku.>
Inuyasha: {off} Sheesh.

5
[The group is walking beside a river in a deep gorge.]
Fx water: shh... <Za...>
<Inuyasha:    YOUKAI ga NIgechimattara dou sun da yo.>
Inuyasha: What'll we do if the Youkai gets away?
<Shippou:    omae no tame jaro ga.>
Shippou: Isn't this for your sake?



Page 6

[View of Sango and Miroku.]
<Sango:    dakedo NARAKU wa nani o TAKURAnde iru n-darou?>
Sango: Still, I wonder what Naraku is planning?
<Miroku:    aa.>
Miroku: Yeah.

2
[View of Shippou on Inuyasha's shoulder.]
<Shippou:    KIGI o KArashite HITOBITO o KOMAraseyou to shitoru no dewa nai ka?>
Shippou: Isn't he trying to make life difficult for villagers by withering the trees?
<Inuyasha:    nnawake nee daro.>
Inuyasha: You gotta be kidding.

3
[Closeup of Miroku looking serious.]
<Miroku:    wazawaza SHIKON no kakera o ATAete...>

<Miroku:    ...to iu TOKORO ga TASHIka ni hikkakari masu.>
