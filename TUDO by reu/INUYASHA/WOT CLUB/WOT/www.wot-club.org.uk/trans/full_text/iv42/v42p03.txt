Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

2
[Closeup of Sango.]
<Sango:    HOUSHI-sama...>
Sango: Houshi-sama...
<Sango:    YARAshii ne.>

[View of the two from behind, and in a strange role-reversal, Sango's hand

Fx Sango: *pat pat* <nade nade>

<Kagome:    KUSURI NUrenai desho-!>
Kagome: I won't be able to apply the cream!

2
[In Kagome's room, Kagome and Inuyasha are sitting on her bed. Nearby is a
medicine box, and Kagome is holding Inuyasha's hand while applying some cream.]
<Kagome:    HOUTAI mo MAku kara ne.>
Kagome: I'm going to bandage it too, okay.
<Inuyasha:    ke_.>
Inuyasha: Bah.
<Inuyasha:    hottkya NAOru tte no ni.>

[Inuyasha looks happy for some reason, while walking with Kagome through the house.]
<Inuyasha:    yoshi_, Iku ka.>
Inuyasha: Right, let's go.
Fx Inuyasha: *stomp stomp* <dosu dosu>
<Kagome:    ittsumo Itte-ru kedo...>
Kagome: I'm _always_ saying this to you, but...

2
[Closeup of Kagome.]
<Kagome:    atashi ga GAKKOU Itte-ru AIDA,>
Kagome: while I'm at school,
<Kagome:    uchi de otonashiku YASUnde te.>
Kagome: rest quietly at home, okay.

3
[Inuyasha turns to Kagome.]
<Inuyasha:    ore wa ZENZEN TSUKAretenee.>
Inuyasha: I'm not tired at all.
<Kagome:    osuwari.>
Kagome: Sit.

4
[Kagome is now at the entrance, with Inuyasha doing a pratfall on the
ground, with her grandfather looking on.]
Fx Inuyasha: clunk... <mishi_...>
<grandad:    kagome_, koitsu o Oite iku no ka_?>
grandad: Kagome! Are you leaving him behind!?
<Kagome:    jii-chan, chanto MIHAtte-te ne.>
Kagome: Jii-chan, please watch over him.

5
[Closeup side view of Kagome.]
<Kagome:    a, sore kara...>
Kagome: Ah, and for now...

6
[Kagome hands the old man a small bag.]
<Kagome:    KOMAtta TOKI wa kore TSUKAtte.>
Kagome: when he starts causing problems, use this.
Fx Kagome: *place* <so_>



Page 7

[Closeup of Kagome turning back as she leaves.]
<Kagome:    ja oNEGAi ne.>
Kagome: Okay, I'll leave him with you then.
<Kagome:    narubeku HAYAku KAEru kara_.>
Kagome: I'll come back as soon as possible!

2
[Inuyasha sits up angrily.]
Fx Inuyasha: *sudden rise* <gaba>
<Inuyasha:    kuora kagome_!>
Inuyasha: Hey! Kagome!
<grandad:    Enerugi- ariAMAtto-ru na-.>
grandad: You've got plenty of energy there.

3
[Closeup side view of the old man.]
<grandad:    SHIKATAnai.>
grandad: I guess there's no choice.
<grandad:    tsuite KInasai.>
grandad: Follow me.

4
[Scene change. View of a shrine building from outside.]

5
[Kagome's grandfather has some scrolls rolled out on a bench and is having
Inuyasha carrying some large packages.]
<grandad:    so-tto HAKObu n-da zo.>
grandad: Carry them gently.
<grandad:    ZETTAI KOWAsu na yo.>
grandad: Absolutely do not break them.
<Inuyasha:    ou.>
Inuyasha: Right.



Page 8
1
[Kagome's mother comes past.]
<mother:    INUYASHA-kun HOUMOTSU DEN no MUSHIBoshi TETSUDAtte kurete-ru no?>
mother: Inuyasha-kun, can you help with airing of the treasures?
<Inuyasha:    o-.>
Inuyasha: Sure.

2
[View of Kagome's mother looking happy, and her grandfather looking serious.]
<mother:    TASUkari masu ne-, ojii-chan.>
mother: He's a great help, isn't he, ojii-chan.
<grandad:    CHIKARA wa aru kara na-.>
grandad: Well, he does have strength.

(    It might seem strange for Kagome's mother to say "ojii-chan" (grandad) when
refering to Kagome's grandfather (ie her father, or father-in-law) directly
as "grandfather". In Japanese, many ways of address like this seem to be
absolute (the guy is a grandfather and is in the right age range), rather
than relative ("my grandfather").)

3
[View of a large pot, with snails drawn on the side.]
<grandad:    TOKI ni kono YUISHO aru NOROi no Tsubo, >
grandad: Particularly this pot with a historic curse,
<grandad:    OMOkute nakanaka HAKObi DAsenakatta kara na.>
grandad: since it's heavy, it's hard to carry.

4
[The two continue to discuss the pot in the background, while in the
foreground, Inuyasha suddenly looks keenly interested.]
<mother:    ma- NOROi no...>
mother: My, a curse...
<grandad:    umu,>
grandad: Indeed,
<grandad:    NANPYAKUNEN o HEta IMA demo YOUKI o HASshiTSUZUkete iru to iu.>
grandad: while put up hundreds of years ago, it is said to still be giving off Youkai-energy today.
Fx Inuyasha: *sparkle* <kira-n>

5
[Closeup of Kagome's grandfather, with a creepy looking background.]
<grandad:    koushite itemo nani yara...>
grandad: Being here like, somehow...
<grandad:    SEsuji no SAMUku naru you na YOUKI o KANjinai ka ne?>
grandad: can't you feel a cold shiver down your spine from the Youkai-energy?



Page 9
1
[Kagome's mother looks on somewhat nervously. However, Kagome's grandfather
is shocked to see Inuyasha standing right behind them with Tetsusaiga raised.]
<mother:    Iwarete mireba SENAKA ni sugoi YOUKI ga.>
mother: Now that you mention it, I feel a large amount of Youkai-energy behind me.
Fx air: whoosh... <Go--->

2
[Kagome's grandfather pulls out the little bag Kagome gave him earlier.]
<grandad:    nuu_!>
grandad: Hmmn!
<grandad:    kagome ni SAZUkarishi NAZO no KOBUKURO o TSUKAu wa IMA!!>
grandad: Now is the time to use the mysterious small pouch Kagome gifted me with!!
Fx pouch: *hold up* <sa_>

3
[FlashBack Flashback to Kagome holding out the pouch, and a small ball from it.
<Kagome:    kore wa oTOMO-dachi no SANGO-chan ni moratta YOUKAI TAIJIYOU no NIOiDAMA.>
Kagome: This is a scent-ball for Youkai-extermination I got from my friend, Sango-chan.
<Kagome:    INUYASHA ni wa KIku hazu yo.>
Kagome: It should be effective on Inuyasha.
EndFlashBack]

[Kagome's grandfather throws the ball down in front of Inuyasha.]
<grandad:    tou.>
grandad: Hup!
Fx smoke: pomph <bomu>

Inuyasha: Guwah!

[The two others look at Inuyasha who's suddenly stopped moving.]
<grandad:    do_, dou ja_?>
grandad: Ho, how was that then?
Fx grandad: *nervous heart beat* <doki doki doki>
Fx mother: cough <koho_>

2
[Kagome's mother looks at Inuyasha carefully - his eyes have gone blank.]
<mother:    KIZETSU shite masu yo.>
mother: He's fallen unconscious.

3
[Kagome's grandfather looks relieved.]
<grandad:    ABUnai tokoro de atta.>
grandad: That was a close shave.

down too.]

[In class, Kagome has tears in her eyes while talking to the teacher.
Kagome's friends look on.]
<teacher:    un_. HIGURASHI wa GAKKOU YASUmigachi dakara na_.>
teacher: Yeah. You're often away from school after all, Higurashi.
<teacher:    IMA kara SHOU-Tesuto da_.>
teacher: I'll give you a short test right away.
<short-hair:    kagome kawaiso~>
short-hair: Poor Kagome.

perm-hair: Why don't we wait for her.
<hair-band:    un, KARESHI no HANASHI mo KIkitai shi-.>

<Kagome:    mohaya, naniga wakaranai ka sura wakaranai...>

3
[The scene shifts back to Kagome's house, where Kagome's mother is bringing
in some snacks. The space where Inuyasha was is now empty.]
<mother:    ara, INUYASHA-kun wa?>
mother: Oh, where's Inuyasha-kun?
<grandad:    a".>
grandad: Ah!

4
[The scene shifts back to just outside Kagome's classroom, where her three
friends are sitting together.]
<hair-band:    demo sa, kagome no KARESHI tte...>
hair-band: But you know, about Kagome's boyfriend...

5
[Closeup of the three.]
<hair-band:    kagome o Iu hodo RANBOU sou ja nakatta yo ne-.>
hair-band: He didn't seem as violent as Kagome said.
