Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

<Title:    KANNON-DOU>
Title: The Kannon Temple

(    Kannon is the Buddhist Goddess of Mercy. The title in Japanese is
"Kannon-dou" where "dou" in this case is a small temple building.)

[View of the small settlement at night.]
<villager:    ONNA bakari no samishii SHUURAKU desu no de...>
villager: {off} A community of just women is a bit lonely...
<villager:    tama no oKYAKU-sama wa UREshuu gozai masu.>
villager: so we're glad to see the occational visitors.

2
[Kagome is kneeling down inside a somewhat rundown building, looking at two
village girls who are bowing slightly to her.]
<villager:    dewa, go-yururi to.
** "go-yururi to" = ??
>
villager: Then, good-night.
<Kagome:    arigatou gozai masu.>
Kagome: Thank you for everything.

3
[While unpacking stuff from her bag, Kagome smiles over at Sango who is
cleaning Hiraikotsu with a cloth.]
<Kagome:    yokatta ne, NOJUKU shinakute sunde...>
Kagome: Isn't it nice, not to have to sleep outdoors...
<Sango:    sorya sou da kedo sa.>
Sango: That's true, but you know...

4
[Closeup of Sango.]
<Sango:    ONI ONNA no SHUURAKU SAGAsanakucha ikenai tte no ni...>
Sango: we really should be searching for this community of Oni-women...
<Sango:    HOUSHI-sama tte ba, HANA no SHITA nobashichatte...>
Sango: .oO(Houshi-sama goes to pieces around women...).

1
[Kagome sidles up to Sango, who looks a bit surprised.]
<Kagome:    ne, SANGO-chan.>
Kagome: Say, Sango-chan.
<Kagome:    MIROKU-sama to nannimo nai no?>
Kagome: Is anything happening between you and Miroku-sama?
<Sango:    e".>
Sango: _Eh_.

2
[Sango looks at Sango, mostly composed.]
<Sango:    nani tte...>
Sango: "Anything"...?
<Sango:    nan no koto?>
Sango: What do you mean?

3
[Closeup of Kagome, hands clasped with emotion. She's blushing slightly and
has stars in her eyes (and around her) while smiling happily.]
<Kagome:    datte, HAKUREI-ZAN de futarikkiri datta desho.>
Kagome: Well, at Mt Hakurei you two were by yourselves right.
<Kagome:    sono AIDA ni...>
Kagome: Back then...
Fx Kagome: (stars) *glitter glitter* <kira kira kira>

4
[Kagome continues talking to Sango, who stares at the floor.]
<Kagome:    Suteki na OMOiDE to ka,>
Kagome: did you make any special memories,
<Kagome:    nakatta wake!?>
Kagome: or similar!?

5
[FlashBack Flashback to when it seemed Miroku was going to die from sucking up the Saimyoushou to save Sango. (volume 27, part 10 - chapter 268).
<Sango:    Oite iku kurai nara...>
Sango: I won't leave you...
<Sango:    koko de ISSHO ni SHInu!>
Sango: We'll die here together!
EndFlashBack]

6
[Closeup of Sango, blushing a bit, looking down at the floor.]
<Sango:    sonna koto KUCHIBASHItta you na KI ga suru kedo...>
Sango: .oO(I think I might have given myself away with that, but...).
<Sango:    YAMA o Orite kara mo, HOUSHI-sama no TAIDO wa kawaranai shi...>
Sango: .oO(even after leaving the mountain, houshi-sama didn't change his attitude...).

(    "Houshi-sama" is how Sango (still) refers to Miroku - treating him a bit
like a stranger suggests she (still) doesn't trust his personality that
much. Or maybe she (now) fears changing her attitude. By "give herself
away", Sango means her hidden feelings for Miroku, though the line is a bit
vague and it seems to me that Sango isn't too sure about her feelings herself.)

[Sango goes back to (apparantly) calmly cleaning her giant boomerang.]
<Sango:    yada na- kagome-chan.>
Sango: Oh come off it, Kagome-chan.
<Sango:    atashi to HOUSHI-sama wa sonna NAKA ja nai n-dakara.>
Sango: Houshi-sama and I aren't like that you know.

2
[Kagome talks to Sango matter-of-factly. Sango looks very shocked and drops
her boomerang.]
<Kagome:    datte SANGO-chan, MIROKU-sama no koto SUki nan desho.>
Kagome: But, you love Miroku-sama don't you Sango-chan.
Fx Sango: urk <giku_>
Fx Sango: (boomerang) *drop loose* <poro>
Fx Hiraikotsu: (hitting floor) thump <dosu>

3
[Sango looks quite flustered.]
<Sango:    so_, sonna wake nai daro.>
Sango: Th, there's no way.
<Sango:    anna Sukebe no ONNA-tarashi...>
Sango: That perverted playboy...

4
[Kagome smiles at Sango, who continues with her tirade. (Kagome also unpacks
what appears to be a wet towel or a tissue or something and wipes her face
with it over the next few frames)]
<Kagome:    soo...>
Kagome: I see...
<Kagome:    maru-wakari nan da kedo na...
** can't find "maru wakari" in my dictionary, but I can guess a translation.
>
Kagome: .oO(It's very obvious though...).
<Sango:    i- ka gen da shi, FURYOU da shi,>
Sango: He's irresponsible, and a delinquent,
<Sango:    HEIDI de Uso tsuku shi...>
Sango: and lies readily, and...

<Kagome:    TOKUBETSU na ONNA no KO tte iu ka,>
Kagome: that you're a special girl to him,
<Kagome:    TAISETSU ni shite-ru te iu ka...>
Kagome: or that you're important to him, or...
<Sango:    so_,>
Sango: D,
<Sango:    sou ka na.>
Sango: do you think so?

2
[Kagome turns to look at Kirara who is at the other end of the room, looking
outside through the holes in the door-frame.]

Miroku: I see, so you lost your husband in a war...
<girl:    hai...>

[Miroku puts his arm around the girl and hugs her close, and she puts a hand
to his chest.]

Miroku: If there is anything I can do to console you...
<girl:    UREshuu gozai masu, HOUSHI-sama.>
girl: I'm so glad, houshi-sama.

6
[Kagome is now watching as well, a little nervously. Sango looks a bit frozen.]

7
[Sango walks off with an annoyed "why me" expression.]
<Kagome:    SANGO-chan.>
Kagome: Sango-chan.
<Sango:    mou NEru...>

Fx Sango: *wobble...* <fura...>
