Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

The older woman from earlier is beside the water's edge with her hand under
the water.]
Fx water: slish... <Za...>

(    Bit hard to translate "ayakashi". Seems a bit like an evil god, but is
basically another type of Youkai.)

<youkai:    aru TOKI warawa wa NINGEN no KOUSOU ni CHOUBUKUsare,>
youkai: However, I was exorcised by a high-ranking human priest,
