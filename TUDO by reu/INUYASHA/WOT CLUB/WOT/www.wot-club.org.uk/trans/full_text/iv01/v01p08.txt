Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

[In her room, Kagome lies on the bed, looking tired but relaxed, and Buyo
(the cat), is snuggled up next to her. Her room is fairly typical of a
Japanese girl's room, except perhaps for the teddy bears at the end of the
bed. She is dressed in a short, dark skirt, with a pinkish jumper and white blouse.]

(    Kagome literally says 'mama' - this is a casual form of 'Mother' used by girls.)

3
[Kagome's mother puts her arms up to play with Inuyasha's ears (whose eyes
contract in anger), while Souta stares up excitedly too, and Kagome speaks
loudly at the others.]

Inuyasha: It's just like Kaede-babaa said...
<Inuyasha:    ME dake wa ii rashi- na.>
Inuyasha: You see [the hairs] well, on top of other things.
<Kagome:    a, anta...>
Kagome: Wh, why you...

Kagome: Tha... thank you...

6
[Inuyasha turns to talk down to Kagome, who stares right back at him.]
<Inuyasha:    nanka omae Mechakucha HADA ga YOWAi mite- da kara na.
                         absurd     body    weak

[Inside the well, Inuyasha and Kagome are travelling through the darkness together.]
Fx skull: *rattle...* <karan...>
<Inuyasha:    iku ze_.>
Inuyasha: Let's go!

2
[In what looks like a small cavern of hair, Yura sits on a floor of skulls.
A closeup shows her holding a skull with a long crop of hair, to which she
is speaking. I wonder if Shakespeare (born in 1564) had written Hamlet by then...]
