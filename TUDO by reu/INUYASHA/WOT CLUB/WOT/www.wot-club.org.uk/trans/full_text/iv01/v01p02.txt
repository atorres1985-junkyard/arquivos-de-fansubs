Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

[View of Inuyasha grinning nastily.]
<Inuyasha:    name-nna yo MUKADE    JOUROU.
              be-fool     centipede 

>The meaning of 'Namenna' is "Don't underestimate me", or "Don't look
>down upon me" (fighing words). If I try to use the expression

>

tongue out and wrapped it around the Shikon no Tama. In an overlayed frame,
Inuyasha looks quite annoyed.]

<monster:    sou de YUBI o kuwaete MIte oide.
                    finger with    see  (=iro=iru+ro)

>'yubi o kuwaete' (putting one's finger in the mouth) is a Japanese
>idiom meaning "enviously".

>'oide' = 'iro' (= 'iru' + 'ro', see above).  (old, used by women)

>'Yubi o kuwaete mite iro!' is a typical cliche used in TV dramas &
>movies. (It is ALWAYS a bad guy who say this, in front of the hero who
>is tied up with a rope, while the bad guys are about to do a reeeeally
>bad thing.... (^^)

>
monster: Stay there and sulk while I do this..
<Inuyasha:    a_, chikushou.>
Inuyasha: ah, shit.
(    The monster actually says a cliche used in TV dramas and movies. It is
_always_ a bad guy who says this, when the hero is tied up, and the bad guy
is about to do a _really_ bad thing.)

>
Kagome: something that makes Youkai become stronger...

(    The word 'Youkai' used here in the Japanese text can be translated as
'monster', 'demon' and so on. However, it is actually a more general term
used to describe a creature which has magical and/or spiritual powers, and
tends to be evil. There isn't a good single word translation of this in
English, so I've decided to leave it untranslated.)
