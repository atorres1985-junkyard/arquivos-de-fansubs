Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

[View of Kagome sitting on the grass with her legs stretched out, eating a
fruit, while Inuyasha sits below the tree and looks like he's edging away
from Kagome.]

<Inuyasha:    sugge- mukakku.
              awful  nauseous.
>
Inuyasha: You're horribly nauseating.
(    The above line shows that Inuyasha is a bit ahead of his time, as the style
and use of the sentance (which is only used by teenagers) has only turned
up in recent years in modern day Japan.)
<Kagome:    ano ne.>
Kagome: Hey you.

[Front view of Kagome's head and shoulders as she points back at herself
with her forefinger.]

Inuyasha: Whoever you may be,

[Side view of Kagome, looking almost sad.]

>
Kagome: But, when you run wild,
<Kagome:    osuwari tte Ieba...
            sit         say-if

>
Kagome: I can just say 'sit'...
(    Kagome is saying that it would be better for Inuyasha is he was nicer,
because she can protect herself from his attacks, and so she isn't worried
about being harmed by him.)

[Inuyasha crashes to the ground, while Kagome apologetic and flaps her hand
at him.]

<Kagome:    IMA no nashi_.
                   do not exist

>'Ima no nashi'... hmm, this is a hard one. Literal translation may be
>something like "What I just did isn't counted."
>
>This expression is used in a situation like this: Two people (intimate
>friends) are playing a card game. During the game, one of them does a
>mistake ex. picks a card and declared his winning when it is not his

>continue the game by bringing back the card to the original pile of

>
Kagome: Forget that happened.
Inuyasha: ......
(    Kagome is saying that Inuyasha should pretend that what she just caused
didn't happen - and she's also ignoring what Inuyasha thinks of this, even
though he got hurt :) )
