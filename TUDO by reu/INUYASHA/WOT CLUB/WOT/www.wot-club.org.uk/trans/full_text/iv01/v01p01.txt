Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

[In a village street from mediaevial Japan, a young man with light-sky
colour hair, and a pink kimono is laughing while the village burns. Many
villagers (mostly male) are in the street, and are armed and injured and
are looking up at the guy in fear.]
Fx house: crackle crackle <bachi bachi>
Fx house: *burning* <go----->
Inuyasha: hahahahahaha!

[Closeup of Inuyasha]
Fx Inuyasha's clothes: whump <dan>
Fx Inuyasha: *leap* <ba->
<Inuyasha:    zamaa   miyagare
              told so  
>
Inuyasha: Too bad guys.
<Inuyasha:    moratte iku ze SHIKON no TAMA
              borrow  go
>
Inuyasha: I'm taking the Shikon no Tama (Base of the Soul Jewel).


(    Actually, Inuyasha's "too bad guys" is considerably ruder in the original
Japanese. From this point on, the full 'flavour' of the Japanese language
will be translated, which means I'll be using real swear words.
"Four Souls Jewel" (or "Jewel of Four Souls" as Viz put it) is a more
obvious translation of Shikon no Tama, due to the association of 4 ("shi")
and a word for death ("shi"). However, the real meaning of the name is
really unclear.)

[Closeup shot of the Shikon no Tama - it's a small coloured ball (bit like a
pearl) on a necklace with lots of small chips of what's probably some stone.]
<Narr:    kore sae  areba, ore wa honmono no youkai ni...
          this only is-if  me     real       ghost

>Example.
>'Kore sae are ba, anata ni aetanoni.'
> = "If only I had had this, I could have met you."
>
>When 'sae' is used in "the subjunctive mood" , it means
>"only", as in the above example. The tense of the original
>sentence is not clear (sentence is not completed), but
>my guess is:
>
>"With this thing, now I (can become) a real ghost."
>
Narr: Only when I have this, a true ghost form is...
(    In general in Japanese, the verb comes at the end of the sentance, which in
the case of the above, is not spoken. Inuyasha is probably saying that he
can become a real ghost with the Shikon no Tama, but we can't be certain.)

[A shot with speed-lines, and a speech bubble.]
voice: {off} Inuyasha!!

[Upper-body shot of Inuyasha as he looks in surprise at the arrow embedded
into his heart - or where the heart of a human would be.]
Fx arrow: thump <dosu>
Inuyasha: !

4
[View of the burning wreckage of a house, with a girl whose holding a bow
standing nearby. She has blood on her right hand, and right side of her
face. The arrow has pinned Inuyasha to a tree in the foreground.]

Inuyasha: Ki... Kikyou..

pool of blood.]
<Kikyou:    SHIKON no TAMA...>
Kikyou: The Shikon no Tama.

[Upper-body shot of Kikyou standing as she grasps the ball in her hand.]
<Kikyou:    konna MONO no tame ni...>
Kikyou: Because of such a thing...

5
[Wide angle shot of some of the village as Kikyou kneels, with a young girl
with a bandage over her right eye trying to support her. We finally get a
good look at her right side - it's covered with blood. A few wounded
villagers tentatively approach.]
<man 1:    KIKYOU-sama...>
man 1: Kikyou-sama...
<man 2:    hidee (hidoi) sazu da...

<Kikyou:    dakara    yoika,      KAEDE...
            therefore ready/okay, kaede

(    In Urusei Yatsura there is a _kunoichi_ (female ninja) called Kaede too.)

[Head and shoulders shot of the girl looking at her sister hand her the
Shikon no Tama.]
<Kikyou:    kore o...>
Kikyou: this ...
<Kikyou:    WATASHI no NAKIGARA to tomo ni MOyase.

Kikyou: must be burnt with my remains.

<Narr:    NIDO to FUTATAbi. Ashiki MONO   domo    no TE   ni WATAranuyou ni.

[Kikyou's body being cremated among the flames. Her fingers are intertwined,
and make a triangle with her two foreigners pointing, tip to tip. The
Shikon no Tama lies between.]
Fx Jewel: *high pitched sound* <pi->

[Inuyasha is slumped against the tree, and only the arrow is keeping him
upright. He looks dead/asleep.]
<Narr:    SHIKON no TAMA wa WATASHI ga ano YO      ni MOtte yuku.

[Shot of an old man sitting inside the room. Behind him is a poster on the
wall, and some boxes. He's holding a key-ring, with a small chain
connecting to a small plaque, then a bit more chain, then a ball.]
<old-man:    umu. kore sae areba KANAI ANZEN    SHOUBAI  KENJOU.
                                 house security business prosper.

old-man: Well. As long as one keeps this, your house will be safe and business shall prosper.

4
[Head and shoulders shot of the earlier speaker - a girl with long black
hair in a sweater, holding a cat. She's now holding the Shikon no Tama and
looking at it, and we can see the writing on the plaque.]
<girl:    kore, Urou tte no? Jii-chan.
                sell
>
girl: Are we going to sell them, Jii-chan?

<girl:    kono, Bi- DAMA o?>
girl: This, glass ball?
<plaque:    HIGURASHI JINJA OMORI >
plaque: Dusk Shrine Good Luck Charm

(    It is very common for such shrines to sell goods associated with the
shrine, the profits from which are used to help run the shrine. The Shikon
no Tama that Kagome's holding is probably not a 'real' one, though it is
not necessarily totally inert.)

[Shot of the room. The old man is sitting in the corner, addressing the
girl, who's now holding the Shikon no Tama above the cat, who is trying to
paw it. Next two the old man, are two large boxes with writing on the side.]

old-man: The Shikon no Tama's history starts with ...
<Kagome:    sore yori jii-chan.>
Kagome: Apart from that jii-chan.

[Close up of Kagome and jii-chan talking to each other.]
<Kagome:    ASHITA nan no hi ka OBOeteru?>
Kagome: Do you remember what day it is tomorrow?
<Jii-chan:    fu-.>
Jii-chan: Heh.

[Close up of the jii-chan holding out a wrapped up box.]
<jii-chan:    kawaii MAGO    no TANJYOUBI, WASUreru wake   ga nakarou.

jii-chan: I've no reason to forget my cute grand-child's birthday.
Fx box: *clench* <gu->

[Kagome is delighted and jii-chan hands the box to her.]
<Kagome:    waa-, Purezento!?>
Kagome: Wow, a present!?
<jii-chan:    ICHINICHI HAYAi kedo na, Happi- Ba-sude- kagome.>
jii-chan: It might be a day early but, happy birthday Kagome.

5
[Kagome is 'delighted' to get what looks like the hand of some monster.]
<jii-chan:    KOUFUKU   o YObu  KAPPA  no TE   no Miira da, somosomo no YURAI wa...
              good luck   bring kappa     hand    mummy   , 1st-ly      history....
>
jii-chan: That mummified _kappa_'s hand brings good luck, it's history starts with...

5
[Kagome casually puts the thing in front of the cat for it to eat, upsetting jii-chan.]
<Kagome:    oTAbe Buyo.>
Kagome: Eat up Buyo.
<jii-chan:    a- kora, mottainai-.>
jii-chan: Ah! hey, that's wasteful.

Narr: My house is a very old shrine.

Narr: We four - Jii-chan, mama, and my young brother are living together.

[In the kitchen, Kagome, her brother, and jii-chan sitting at a table
eating, while her mother brings a tray.]
<jii-chan:    somosomo kono TSUKEMONO no YURAI wa...
              1st      this pickles      history
>
jii-chan: These pickles' history starts with...
<Kagome:    UJIKO-san kara moratta n-deshou-.>
Kagome: They were from Ujiko-san weren't they.

(    'Ujiko' is a Shintoism term, meaning a group of Shintoists belonging to
each Shinto Shrine. Ujiko usually live near the shrine they contribute to,
and supports the activities of the shrine, including financial aspects.
 In this conversation, we should assume that Kagome is pointing out that
the pickles were, either offered from such people, or maybe they gave the
pickles to the Kagome's family as a present, since Kagome's family and
those 'ujiko' people should have known each other for a long time.)

[Kagome is dressed for school (short skirt!), and is running as she leaves,
with a school-bag around her shoulders.]
<Kagome:    itte kima-su!>
Kagome: I'm o-off!

(    Kagome's school socks are literally called "loose socks" - ie they don't
fit tightly, which is why they look rather thick. This is the current
fashion of schoolgirls of around Kagome's age, though some people think
they are bad taste.)

3
[Kagome remembering her grandfather explaining to her.
<Narr:	  Jii-chan kara NANDO	  KIkakire temo,

Narr: Now matter how often I hear jii-chan say,

<Narr:    JUU-GO-SAI ni natta  KYOU made wa.

[Inside the well, Kagome and Souta stand near the doorway, looking down the
short steps to the ground floor.]
Souta: Buyo---.
Fx floor: squeak... <gi_>

2
[View from their POV of a wooden box (the top of the well) at the bottom of
the steps, on which something is lying. Haven't been able to find out what
it is exactly, but it probably servers as some kind of magical seal.]
<Souta:    SHITA ni iru to OMOu n-da kedo...
           I think he's down below, but...

Souta: {off}
<Kagome:    orireba?>
Kagome: {off} Why don't you do down?

[View from below of the two looking down. Kagome's now crouching beside her brother.]
<Souta:    datte koko... nan ka KIMOchi WARUi ja-n.

[The top of the well bursts open, and out comes the torso of a woman with
long black hair, a sort of vacant stare with tiny pupils, two black spots
above each eye, and six arms. Two hands wrap around Kagome's neck and two
more take her right arm. Kagome is pulled back, and lets go of the cat.]

[Kagome is now standing before the tree, on which Inuyasha is still pinned
to. It's obviously been some time, as some thick vines have entwined
themselves around him - supporting him. His head is lying to one side
making it look like that he's asleep, and his _kimono_ looks a bit worn, as
does the arrow. Apart from that, he appears unchanged. I wonder what made
the vines grow like that...]
Fx leaves: rustle... <zawa..>

voice1: This place is totally off-limits.
<voice2:    TAKOKU no MONO ka!?>
voice2: Are you from a foreign province?

(    While she is literally being asked if she is a foreigner, Kagome is not
being asked if she's from a country outside Japan, but another part of
Japan. If it was after the Edo Era started (in 19th century), Kagome would
be being asked if she was from outside Japan. Before then Japan was split
into provinces, each being governed by different warlords (or _Daimyo_, and
customs and culture were totally different from each other.)

[Kagome looks back in surprise/concern while still leaning against Inuyasha.]
Kagome: ....

[Long view of some small fields and a few small buildings, and some wooded
hills in the distance. The scene has now moved back to the village, which I
guess was set up after the one near Inuyasha (from the beginning of this
chapter) was abandoned.]
