Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

[In the village Inuyasha is watching the floating girls (who are all
carrying various weapons) without much expression, while Kaede (lying on
the ground, bleeding) talks up to Inuyasha with a grim expression on her face.]

                             say       =yagaru?
KIREIgoto = idealogically and morally correct, but impractical
nakasu = say (slang, and often insulting). Also used by samurais of the Edo era.

Kagome: _ahhhhhh_, what joy....

(    _Sound of a hot bath_ - This is one of the famous inventions of Rumiko
Takahashi. Sound effect for a "hot bath"!  It came from the reverberation
of the sound of soap boxes or small tubs hitting the tile floor in a big
bathroom (particularly public baths). It may be difficult to imagine such a
sound in a bathroom in Western countries...)
