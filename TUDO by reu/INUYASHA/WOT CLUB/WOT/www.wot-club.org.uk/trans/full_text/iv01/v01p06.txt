Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

She's facing towards us with a slight smile, and her hair is being blown to
the right. Behind her, Inuyasha is glaring off to the left.]

Title: Inverted-hair Yura
(    Yura is a name, and could be translated as 'Fine Net' in this case. In
"Dust Spot" ("Wasted Minds" in the West), a 5-part manga by Rumiko
Takahashi written in 1979, the main female character is called "Yura" too.
While there are Japanese names 'Yura' (with various kanji characters), the
particular one here is different. Sakasa-gami (Inverted-hair) is also the
name of an island from the Mermaid Saga.)

[Shoulder deep in the water, Kagome turns back to Kaede with a peeved
expression, and her breath is coming out in puffs, due to the cold.]

[In a tree, Inuyasha sits on a branch with his back to a trunk, perhaps
listening to the men, perhaps not buying the story made up so that Kagome
could have a peaceful bath...]

back down at her on a ledge by the river.]

<Kagome:    osuwari!!>

            indecent          sneakily peep in
The 'tari shite' is more filling in (to make sentance sound better).
>
Kagome: That's indecent - sneakily peeping on me.
<Inuyasha:    a~?>
Inuyasha: Hu-uh?

<Inuyasha:    ke_, Baka ka omae,>
Inuyasha: Keh, you idiot,
<Inuyasha:    ore wa tada na---->
Inuyasha: I was just...

5
[Still turning back to look at Inuyasha, Kaede holds up a small object in
her fingers.]
<Kaede:    SHIKON no TAMA no kakera   o NUSUmi   ni KIta n-darou.
                             fragment   stealing
>
Kaede: You came to steal the Shikon no Tama fragment didn't you.

6
[Sitting up with his back to Kaede's, Inuyasha looks off into the distance
with a faintly annoyed expression.]
<Inuyasha:    wakatte n-ja ne- ka, KAEDE-babaa.>
Inuyasha: I see you understand, Kaede-babaa.
<Kaede:    mattaku, SAKI ga OMOi  yarareru ga na...

[Inuyasha looks up at the sky, with a slightly bored expression, and some
birds are flying in the sky behind him.]

>
Inuyasha: I'm saying I'll work with that unlikeable woman for the sake of the Jewel.

3
[From Inuyasha's point of view, Kagome walks towards him, pointing back at
herself with her right thumb. She is wearing clothes just like Kikyou was
in the first chapter, and even her hair is tied up in the same style.]
<Kagome:    anta,>
Kagome: So,
<Kagome:    sonna ni atashi ga KIRAi nan da.>
Kagome: You hate me that much, do you.

[Inuyasha stares at Kagome without much expression.]

[From around a corner of rock, comes a village woman, walking with a small
child, and carrying a baby on her back.]

<Kaede:    ikinari  TAOreta    to?
           abruptly collapsed
>
Kaede: She suddenly collapsed?

5
[Kaede begins to walk off with the woman, and turns her head back to talk to
Kagome and Inuyasha.]
<Kaede:    washi wa SAKI ni MODOru de na,
           I                go back

Kaede: I'll go back first so,
<Kaede:    Kenka suru na yo.
           brawl      nai
>
Kaede: try not to fight.

6
[Inuyasha looks back with an annoyed expression, while Kagome's face has
little expression at all.]
Inuyasha & Kagome: ......

[Still on the river bank, Kagome tends to her clothes which are on a
horizontal branch suspended by two others stuck into the ground. Inuyasha
is sitting with his back to her.]
Fx clothes: *flapping* <bata bata>
<Inuyasha:    oi.>
Inuyasha: Oi.
<Kagome:    nani yo>
Kagome: What.

2
[Inuyasha turns his head to talk to Kagome.]
<Inuyasha:    NUgi na.

>
Inuyasha: Get 'em off.

3
[View of the sky.]
Fx sound: *gonggg n-n-n* <go-nnn>

4
[Kagome has just clobbered Inuyasha with a rock bigger than her head, and is
talking angrily down to him, as he clutches his head in pain.]
Fx head: *ring-n-n*... <nnn...>
<Inuyasha:    temee... nani o...>
Inuyasha: Bitch... what the...
<Kagome:    iuarashi_>
Kagome: Indecent!

[Inuyasha points angrily at Kagome's school clothes, while she puts a hand
to her current clothes, and looks back at him, annoyed.]

<Inuyasha:    HADAKA ni narete itte ja nee_,
              naked     become?

<Inuyasha:    ano Hen na KIMONO  KIro ttsutte n-da__.

<Kagome:    KIKYOU ni NIteru kara!?
                      resemble

Inuyasha: {aside} humph <he_>
<Kagome:    CHUUGAKUSEI        ka, koitsu
            mid-school-student
>
Kagome: .oO(What a kid.).
(    Kagome literally says that Inuyasha's like a middle school student (which
is was Kagome is) - ie like a 13-15 year old. Inuyasha is presumably quite
a lot older since he hardly seems to be bothered by the passage of time.)

Kagome: You'll be OK without me, won't you.

Kagome: What's up,
<Kagome:    TOmeta tte MUDA yo.
            stop       useless
>
Kagome: Saying 'stop' is futile.

2
[Side view of Inuyasha coming up to Kagome, holding his hand out. In turn
Kagome holds up a little draw-string bag.]
<Inuyasha:    TAMA no Kakera    MOtte    n-daro,

[Inside a room, a girl is lying on some _tatami_ mats (traditional Japanese
straw floor coverings), with a kimono laid over her. By the mats is a
bundle of straw, which was being made into a rope, and a cleaver. Kaede is
walking in carrying a jar in her hands, while the girl's mother stands
behind her, with her other children.]

[Standing on a wire way up in the air is a human looking girl. She has short
black hair (a bit like Nabiki from Ranma 1/2, except this girl has a white
ribbon tied on top of her head), some longish black, fingerless gloves, a
black ribbon tied in a bow around her neck and there's something like a
black sock around her feet, but the toes and sole are left bare. She's also
wearing a black, short, and rather revealing one-piece, has a white,
patterned sash tied around her waist, and a katana is attached to it on the
left hand side. Fanning out from her fingers are many threads. She's
looking down at Kagome with a slightly mocking expression, and is also
wearing some lipstick, which is probably black too.]
