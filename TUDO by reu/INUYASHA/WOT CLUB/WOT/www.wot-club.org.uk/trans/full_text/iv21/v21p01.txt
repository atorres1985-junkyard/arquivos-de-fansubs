Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

1
[View of Inuyasha with a serious and seemingly slightly annoyed look, while
standing, looking off at something.]
<Inuyasha:    Gaseneta ja nee no ka-?>
Inuyasha: Isn't it a false lead?
<Inuyasha:    konna HITOZATO ni, SHIKON no kakera ga aru nante yo-.>
Inuyasha: I doubt there's a Shikon fragment in such a busy place.

2
[View of a wide bridge over a river, with many people bustling around the area.]

3
[View of Sango, Kagome - pushing her bike along with Shippou in the front -
and Miroku at the outskirts of the village.]
<Sango:    kagome-chan nannimo KEHAI KANjinai no?>
Sango: Kagome-chan, can you sense one at all?
<Kagome:    un ZENZEN.>
Kagome: No, nothing.
<Miroku:    ma, tonikaku...>
Miroku: Well, at any rate...

4
[Miroku waves to a surprised Sango, and Kagome.]
<Miroku:    TEKITOU ni chirabatte SAGAshi mashou.>
Miroku: Let's each go our own way to search for it.
<Miroku:    KAISAN.>
Miroku: Break up.
<Sango:    tte...>
Sango: You mean...

[Closeup of Sango, with Kirara on her shoulder.]
<Sango:    HITORI ni natte ONNA hikkakeru KI ja nai no? HOUSHI-sama.>
Sango: when you're by yourself, you intend to go pick up girls, Houshi-sama?

2
[View of Miroku from behind.]
Miroku: ......

3
[Kagome just watches, while Sango is giving Miroku a 'look'.]
Sango: ......

4
[Sango chases after Miroku who strides off. Kagome and Inuyasha casually
walk in the other direction.]
Fx Miroku: {comically} *stride stride* <suta suta>
<Sango:    chotto_,>
Sango: Hey!
<Sango:    ii no? so-yu- TAIDO de.>
Sango: What is it with that attitude?
Fx Sango: {comically} *stride stride* <suta suta>
<Kagome:    kocchi SAGAso.>
Kagome: Let's look this way.
<Inuyasha:    o-.>
Inuyasha: Sure.

5
[A bit later, Kagome and Inuyasha are sitting and lying down on the river
bank, the sun shining down on them - Kagome is basking in the sunlight and
Inuyasha seems to be taking a nap.]
<Kagome:    a- ii TENKI.>
Kagome: Ahh - lovely weather.

6
[Closeup of Kagome looking around in mild surprise.]
<Kagome:    are? SHIPPOU-chan wa?>
Kagome: Huh? Where's Shippou-chan?
<Inuyasha:    a-?>
Inuyasha: Hmm?

7
[White frame.]
<Inuyasha:    ASObi ni Itta n-ja ne- no ka?>
Inuyasha: {off} Did he go off to play huh?
<Inuyasha:    mada Gaki dakara na.>
Inuyasha: He's still a kid after all.



Page 4
1
[Shippou is standing on some grass licking a lolly-pop - I guess Kagome gave
it to him.]
<Shippou:    tama ni wa FUTARIkiri ni shite yaraneba na.>
Shippou: Sometimes we have to leave those two by themselves.

2
[Wide view of Shippou sitting on large root or old fallen over tree on a
grassy bank.]
<Shippou:    ha- mattaku KI o TSUKAu wai.>
Shippou: Hah, I sure do take care of them.

3
[Shippou looks off at some noise.]
<voice:    kono Kosodoro!>
voice: {off} You damn thief!
Fx sound: {off} whack <doka_>

4
[Near to the river, 3 small boys are kicking a girl who's now on her knees.
One of them has a stick. They're all pretty young - the girl is about Rin's
size and age.]
<boy#1:    Satsuki, temee ore n-CHI no HOSHIGAKI TOtta daro.>
boy#1: Satsuki, you took the Hoshigaki (dried persimmon) from my place didn't you?
Fx boy#1: whack <doka>
<Satsuki:    TOttenai yo.>
Satsuki: I didn't take it.
<boy#2:    DAMAre, kono MUSHI-Kera.>
boy#2: Shutup, you good-for-nothing.

5
[Closeup of the girl. She has pretty short hair, in a small pony-tail at the
back tied with a ribbon. At the moment she's pretty angry as well as a bit dirty.]
<Satsuki:    omae-ra minna...>
Satsuki: All of you...
<Satsuki:    nii-chan ga KAEtte KItara, yattsukete yaru kara na.>
Satsuki: when my nii-chan (big brother) comes home, he'll beat you up you know.



Page 5
1
[View of two of the boys.]
<boy#1:    ba-ka, omae no nii-chan tokku ni IKUSA de SHInjimatte-ru ja nee ka.>
boy#1: Stu-u-pid, your brother died long ago in the war didn't he?
<boy#2:    ore no tou-chan ga SHIniMIZU totta n-dakara na.>
boy#2: My father was at his side when he passed away you know.

(    What the boy says is more literally like "my father gave him his last sip
of water (before he died)". He doesn't literally mean that this happened -
giving someone a sip of water when they're at death's door and staying with
them until they die is a tradition, hence the phrase. Perhaps the closest
equivilant in English would be "My father read him his last rights.")

2
[The girl bites one of the boys in the leg.]
<Satsuki:    nii-chan wa SHIndenai!>
Satsuki: Nii-chan isn't dead!
Fx Satsuki: {comically} *chomp* <gabu>
<boy#1:    wa_, itete!>
boy#1: Wha! Owow!

3
[The boys beat up Satsuki again.]
<boy#1:    koitsu ONNA no kuse ni!>
boy#1: Damn violent girl!
Fx boy#2: (with stick) whack <Doka_>

4
[The boys stop their attack when a large menacing monster appears floating
in the air near them, with spectral flames around it. Well, as menacing as
you can be with a body like a balloon, two big disjoint eyes and tiny legs
and arms. It's Shippou of course - like his original entrance.]
Fx Shippou: whoosh <don>
Fx Shippou: *spooky appearance* <doro doro doro>
<Shippou:    o~ma~e~ra~>
Shippou: Wh~h~y yo~u~
<boys:    de!?>
boys: Ack!?



Page 6
1
[The boys run off in panic, one tripping over.]
<boy#1:    ba_, bakemono-_.>
boy#1: A, a monster-r!
Fx boy#1: {comically} whizz... <pu---..>
Fx boy#2: (falling over) flomp <pata>

2
[Shippou de-transforms, looking kinda smug.]
Fx Shippou: pomph <doron>
<Shippou:    fu_,>
Shippou: Heh,
<Shippou:    KAtta.>
Shippou: I beat them.

3
[Closeup of Shippou turning to the girl, with a bit of a stern look. (I
think he's trying to act 'cool'.)]
<Shippou:    MUSUME,>
Shippou: Girl,
<Shippou:    mou DAIJOUBU ja.>
Shippou: you're safe now.

4
[Closeup of the girl looking a bit surprised.]
<Satsuki:    a...>
Satsuki: Ah...

5
[Satsuki pats Shippou on the head (rubs his head actually, in thanks) - even
sitting she's easily taller than him.]
<Satsuki:    arigatou, Tanuki.>
Satsuki: Thanks, Tanuki.
Fx Satsuki: (Shippou) *rub rub* <nade nade>
<Shippou:    Kitsune ja.>
Shippou: I'm a Kitsune.

6
[The girl takes out something and Shippou goes wide-eyed.]
<Satsuki:    TASUkete kureta REI da.>
Satsuki: This is for saving me.
<Satsuki:    HANBUN KUu?>
Satsuki: Want half?
<Shippou:    e".>
Shippou: _Eh_.

7
[Satsuki is casually sitting on the ground, eating the food, while Shippou
is looking at her a bit wide-eyed.]
<Satsuki:    NUSUnda HOSHIGAKI,>
Satsuki: The Hoshigaki I stole,
<Satsuki:    umai yo.>
Satsuki: it's delicious.
<Shippou:    ko, koitsu ga WARUMONO datta n-ja...>
Shippou: .oO(It, it was her that was at fault...).

8
[Closeup of Satsuki smiling happily.]
<Satsuki:    anta TSUYOi n-da ne.>
Satsuki: You're strong aren't you.
Fx Satsuki: *smile* <niko_>

9
[Shippou goes wide-eyed again, but in a different way. (uh oh...)]
Fx Shippou: *heart skip a beat...* <doki...>



Page 7
1
[View of the sky - it's getting dark.]
<Shippou:    Satsuku... to itta na.>
Shippou: {off} You're... Satsuki right?
<Shippou:    omae OYA wa?>
Shippou: Where's your parents?
<Satsuki:    inai yo.>
Satsuki: {off} Don't have any.
<Satsuki:    nii-chan ga hitori.>
Satsuki: I have one elder brother.

2
[View of Satsuki looking off into the distance a proud smile on her face.]
<Satsuki:    IKUSA de OOTEGARA o tatete,>
Satsuki: He really distinguished himself in action,
<Satsuki:    SAMURAI ni natte atashi o MUKAe ni KUru n-da.>
Satsuki: and when he becomes a samurai, he'll come to pick me up.

3
[View of Shippou looking up at her, still a bit wide-eyed.]
<Shippou:    SAKI hodo no Gaki-domo wa Uso o Itta no ka?>
Shippou: Those brats from earlier were lying then?
<Shippou:    omae no ANI wa...>
Shippou: About your brother that is...

4
[Closeup of Satsuki with a coldly determined expression.]
<Satsuki:    KAEtte kuru sa.>
Satsuki: He'll come back, you'll see.
<Satsuki:    tatoe SHIndeta tte Ikite KAEtte kuru.>
Satsuki: Even if he's dead he'll come back alive.

5
[Closeup of Shippou nervously edging away.]
<Shippou:    e"...?>
Shippou: _Eh_...?



Page 8
1
[Satsuki reaches into her clothes again.]
<Satsuki:    hehe_ TOKUBETSU ni MIsete yaru yo, atashi no TAKARA.>
Satsuki: Hehe! Just for you, I'll show you my treasure.
<Satsuki:    kore ni GAN o kakereba, nandemo NEGAi ga kanau n-da.>
Satsuki: If you prey with this, any wish will be granted.

2
[Satsuki holds out what looks like a Shikon fragment, though it doesn't
react like one.]
<Satsuki:    kirei daro...>
Satsuki: Isn't it pretty...
<Satsuki:    SHIKON no TAMA tte iu...>
Satsuki: It's called the Shikon no Tama...
<Satsuki:    YOUKAI no oTAKARA no kakera da yo.>
Satsuki: and is a fragment of a treasure to Youkai.

3
[Closeup of Shippou looking rather shocked.]
<Shippou:    shi_... SHIKON no kakera!?>
Shippou: .oO(A... a Shikon fragment!?).

4
[Scene change to a view of a large house, at evening.]
<voice:    HONTOU de gozaimasu ka, HOUSHI-sama.>
voice: {off} Are you certain, Houshi-sama?
<voice:    waga YA ni YOUKAI ga SUKUtte iru to!?>
voice: There's a Youkai haunting my house!?
<Miroku:    hai.>
Miroku: {off} Yes.



Page 9
1
[Closeup of Miroku looking serious.]
<Miroku:    IKKOKUmo HAYAku oHARAi o seneba.>
Miroku: We must exorcise it as soon as possible.

2
[Miroku and an oldish looking man are walking on the walkway around the building.]
Fx Miroku: tmp tmp <tota tota>
<Miroku:    REI ni wa oyobi masen, NANUSHI-sama.>
Miroku: There is no need for a reward, nanushi-sama (village head).
Fx village-head: tmp tmp <tota tota>
<village-head:    ie,>
village-head: Oh no,
<village-head:    MINA-SAMA no oSHOKUJI to oTOKO GOYOUI itashi masu.>
village-head: I'll get dinner and bedding provided for everyone.

3
[Behind them is Inuyasha, Kagome and Sango. Inuyasha has a sort of bored
annoyed expression, Kagome is holding up a finger, and Sango has a look of
depressed tolerance.]
Fx group: tmp tmp <tota tota>
<Inuyasha:    ma-ta Uso-ppachi o...>
Inuyasha: _Another_ downright lie...
<Kagome:    shi_...>
Kagome: Shh...

4
[Inuyasha and Kagome look up in surprise at a noise.]
Fx ceiling floorboards: rattle rattle <Kata Kata Kata>
<Inuyasha:    n?>
Inuyasha: Hn?
<Kagome:    ji, JISHIN!?>
Kagome: Ear, earthquake!?

5
[Miroku is calmly looking up.]
Fx ceiling floorboards: rattle rattle <Kata Kata Kata>
Miroku: ......

6
[Miroku slaps an ofuda (paper warding/talisman) onto a post.]
Fx Miroku: *ofuda* *paste* <peta>
Fx sound: {off} *yelp of pain* <Gi_>



Page 10
1
[Looking at the house from outside, a large Youkai (seems like a lizard)
comes out from the roof, surrounded by a dark cloud.]
Fx youkai: sizzle... <Ju-->
Fx youkai: *scream...* <Giiiii...>
Fx mist: hshht... <Za---...>

2
[Inside, Sango, Kagome and Inuyasha are staring at Miroku in surprise, who
has an annoyed look.]
<Sango:    ...ita n-da.>
Sango: ...There was one.
<Kagome:    HONTOU datta n-da.>
Kagome: There really was one.
<Inuyasha:    Uso ja nee no ka.>
Inuyasha: It wasn't a lie huh?
<Miroku:    ano ne.>
Miroku: Do you mind.

3
[Kagome and Inuyasha look to the side.]
Fx Shippou: {off} *running...* <tatata...>
<Shippou:    ta_, TAIHEN ja INUYASHA-_.>
Shippou: {off} B, big news, Inuyasha-a!
<Inuyasha:    n?>
Inuyasha: Hn?

4
[Shippou jumps towards Kagome, looking kinda panicked.]
Fx Shippou: *jump* <ta_>
<Shippou:    kagome_.>
Shippou: Kagome!
<Kagome:    SHIPPOU-chan,>
Kagome: Shippou-chan,
<Kagome:    yoku koko ga wakatta wa ne.>
Kagome:  how did you know where we were?



Page 11
1
[Shippou explains some things and Miroku looks has a similar sort of
depressed tolerance that Sango had a while ago. Kagome seems to be a bit
taken back or amused.]
<Shippou:    kono ATAri de ICHIBAN YUUFUKUsou na IE de, oHARAI o shite iru to funda n-ja.>
Shippou: I guessed that this house was the best in the area for profiting from an exorcism.

2
[Shippou says something else, surprising Kagome and Sango behind her.]
<Shippou:    to, tonikaku...>
Shippou: An, anyway...
<Shippou:    atta zo, SHIKON no kakera.>
Shippou: There _is_ a Shikon fragment here.
<Kagome:    ee!?>
Kagome: Ehh!?

3
[Outside in the garden is Satsuki. It's dark now.]
Satsuki: ......

4
[Kagome, Inuyasha and the village-head look on.]
<Kagome:    ano KO...?>
Kagome: That girl is...?
<village-head:    oya,>
village-head: My,
<village-head:    Satsuki ja nai ka.>
village-head: Satsuki, isn't it.

5
[Kagome comes over to Satsuki with a kind smile, though Satsuki backs away.]
<Kagome:    ne,>
Kagome: Say,
<Kagome:    onee-chan ni kakera MIsete kurenai?>
Kagome: could you show onee-chan the fragment please?
Satsuki: ......

(    Kagome says "show onee-chan" but she's addressing herself in the 3rd person
- ie means the same as "show me". This style of expression is common when a
adult (or near) is addressing a child.)



Page 12
1
[Closeup of Satsuki looking a bit worried and nervous.]
<Satsuki:    toru KI ja nai darou ne?>
Satsuki: You're not intending to take it are you?

2
[Closeup of Inuyasha.]
<Inuyasha:    toru ze.>
Inuyasha: We'll take it.
<Inuyasha:    HONMONO nara na.>
Inuyasha: If it's the real thing.

3
[Kagome turns away from Inuyasha, who splats to the ground, back to Satsuki
who backs away again.]
<Kagome:    INUYASHA osuwari.>
Kagome: Inuyasha sit.
Fx Inuyasha: {comically} squish <gusha>
<Kagome:    DAIJOUBU MIru dake dakara.>
Kagome: It's okay, I just want to look at it.

4
[Closeup side view of Shippou thinking worriedly.]
<Shippou:    so, sou ja, kakera o toriagete shimattara, Satsuki no NEGAi wa...>
Shippou: .oO(Th, that's right - if they confiscate the fragment, Satsuki's wish will...).

5
[In the foreground Shippou is clutching his head in remorse, while behind
him Kagome and Sango are just looking at what Satsuki is showing them.]
Fx Kagome and Sango: *sta-a-a-a-re* <ji--->
<Shippou:    ora to shita koto ga nanto KEISOTSU na.>
Shippou: .oO(I've been so rash.).

6
[Satsuki leaves running, looking back.]
<Satsuki:    mou ii daro.>
Satsuki: That's enough isn't it.
<Satsuki:    atashi KAEru yo.>
Satsuki: I'm going home.
Fx Satsuki: tmp <ta_>

7
[Kagome waves and Shippou looks up at her in surprise.]
<Kagome:    arigato, KI o tsukete.>
Kagome: Thanks, take care.
<Shippou:    e".>
Shippou: _Eh_.

[The village head calls out.]

<village-head:    mada uchi ni KUru KI ni naran ka.>
village-head: Don't you feel like coming around again?

2
[Satsuki answers while running home.]
<Satsuki:    ii you.>
Satsuki: It's okay.
<Satsuki:    IMA ni nii-chan ga KAEtte kuru kara.>
Satsuki: Nii-chan will be coming home.

3
[Shippou is sitting on Kagome's shoulder looking at her.]
<Shippou:    kagome... ano kakera...>
Shippou: Kagome... that fragment [was a fake]...?
<Kagome:    u-n.>
Kagome: Yeah.

4
[Closeup of Sango.]
<Sango:    SHIPPOU...>
Sango: Shippou...
<Sango:    are wa ISHI no HANA da yo.>
Sango: That was a stone flower.

5
[Kagome looks at Sango.]
<Shippou:    ISHI no HANA...?>
Shippou: Stone flower...?
<Kagome:    ...tte SEKIEI no koto ne.>
Kagome: ...Oh, you mean quartz right.
<Sango:    tonikaku YAMA o HOrya DEte kuru ISHI sa.>
Sango: Anyway, it's a stone you can dig up on mountains.
<Sango:    SHIKON no kakera nanka ja nai yo.>
Sango: It's no Shikon fragment.

6
[Closeup of Shippou.]
<Shippou:    Ni... Nisemono...>
Shippou: .oO(A... a fake...).

7
[View of a lot lamp.]
<village-head:    Satsuki wa AWAre na KO de na.>
village-head: Satsuki is an pitiful child.



Page 14
1
[The village-head, and the rest of the gang are having dinner.]
<village-head:    ANI ga IKUSA de SHInda koto wa MACHIGAinai to iu no ni, SHINjiyou to sen.>
village-head: It's said to be certain that her brother died in a war, but she doesn't seem to believe it.
<Miroku:    hahaa.>
Miroku: I see.

2
[Cut to Satsuki is walking back looking at the fragment in her hands.]
Fx leaves: rustle... <Zaa...>
<village-head:    uchi de MENDOU o miyou to Ittemo,>
village-head: {voice over} Though I've said I'll take care of her,
<village-head:    ANI to KUrashite ita KOYA kara UGOkou to sen no desu.>
village-head: she won't move from the hut where she lived with her brother.

3
[Satsuki is walking down a path, and in the bushes nearby a menacing eye can
be seen.]
Fx youkai: rustle... <Zawa...>
youkai: ......

4
[Closeup of the Youkai - it appears to be the lizard from earlier.]
<youkai:    NANUSHI no IE wa OiDAsare chimatta ga...>
youkai: I was forced out of the village-head's house, but...
<youkai:    ano KOMUSUME TSUKAeru...>
youkai: I can use that girl...

Page 15

[Scene change. Black frame.]
<Shippou:    HONMONO no SHIKON no kakera ni GAN o kakereba...>
Shippou: .oO(If she prays with the real Shikon fragments...).
<Shippou:    Satsuki no ANI wa Ikite KAEtte kuru n-jaro ka...>
Shippou: .oO(Satsuki's brother will return alive, huh...).

2
[The gang are sleeping in a room. Sango and Kagome are sleeping on separate
futons, as is Miroku with a divider between the two groups. Inuyasha is
sitting (asleep) with his back against the wall near Miroku. Shippou is
'sleeping' next to Kagome, but his eyes are open.]
<Shippou:    sou ja... SUKOshi KAriru kurai...>
Shippou: .oO(That's right... if I borrow them for a bit...).
Shippou: ......

3
[Closeup of Shippou sitting up and leaning over Kagome. Kagome is in her
pajamas, and seems to be having a nightmare about a trigonometry maths
problem - there is a thought balloon next to her showing one, and she's sweating.]
Fx Kagome: unn unn <u~n u~n>
Fx Shippou: *moving slowly* <so-->

4
[Closeup of Shippou taking the small bottle with the real Shikon fragments.]
Fx Shippou: *moving slowly...* <so...>

5
[Shippou is suddenly hoisted into the air - Inuyasha has picked him up by
the tail.]
<Inuyasha:    oi.>
Inuyasha: Hey.

6
[Shippou turns nervously to Inuyasha.]
<Shippou:    kore mo HITODASUke ja.>
Shippou: This is to help someone.
<Inuyasha:    Neboke te-n ja ne- yo.>
Inuyasha: You're not thinking straight are you.



Page 16
1
[Inuyasha is talking to Shippou sternly.]
<Inuyasha:    SHIPPOU, omae datte SHIKON no TAMA no YABA-sa wa SHItte n-daro.>
Inuyasha: Shippou, you know just how troublesome the Shikon no Tama is don't you.
<Inuyasha:    NINGEN nanzo ni TSUKAeru SHIROMONO ja nee n-da.>
Inuyasha: It's not something that some human should ever use.

2
[Closeup of Shippou, edging away.]
<Inuyasha:    daitai ome-, nande ano KOMUSUME ni KATAIresu n-da~?>
Inuyasha: Besides, why are you supporting that girl anyway?

3
[Miroku sits up on the other side of the divider, looking a bit sleepy-eyed.
Shippou looks at him in shock.]
Fx Miroku: *sit up* <muku_>
<Miroku:    HOreta n-deshou.>
Miroku: Fallen for her haven't you.
<Miroku:    KEKKOU kawaii KAO shite mashita kara na.>
Miroku: She was pretty cute I know.
Fx Shippou: urk! <giku>

4
[Inuyasha bops Shippou on the head.]
<Inuyasha:    teme- so-yu- kudarane- RYUU de...>
Inuyasha: You bastard, for such a pathetic reason...
Fx Inuyasha: *rap rap* <pita pita>

5
[Shippou responds angrily, and Inuyasha gets a really (comically) irritated look.]
<Shippou:    ya, yakamashii.>
Shippou: Sh, shut up.
<Shippou:    yoshinba HOrete ita to shitemo,>
Shippou: Even if I'm in love with her,
<Shippou:    KIKYOU to kagome no AIDA Urouro-shitoru omae ni Iwareru SUJIAI wa nai wai_.>
Shippou: you've no right to say that to me as you're drifting between Kikyou and Kagome.
Fx Inuyasha: *angry twitch* <piku>

6
[Inuyasha is now sitting down again, his back to Shippou. Shippou has a
large lump on his head and is obviously dazed. Kagome's trigonometry
nightmare is continuing.]
Fx Shippou: clunk... <mishi...>
<Inuyasha:    mou NEro.>
Inuyasha: Go to sleep already.



Page 17

[Scene change. It's now morning - view of some birds flying near some trees.]
Fx birds: *chirp chirp...* <chichi...>

2
[Shippou is walking along alone, looking a bit depressed.]
<Shippou:    semete WAKAre no aisatsu o shite Ikou.>
Shippou: .oO(I should at least go say goodbye to her.).

3

[Inside Satsuki's hut is a young man lying on a mat bed - he's sitting up
looking at Shippou with a slight smile. He has a bandage around his head,
and there's also some armour stacked down in the room. Satsuki is happily
showing Shippou her brother.]
Fx brother: rasp... <Shu-->
<Satsuki:    hora_, Kega wa shite-ru kedo...>
Satsuki: See! He is injured though...
Shippou: ......

[View of a container of water near to Satsuki's brother. Part of a face,
with a bandage around the head, can be seen - but it clearly isn't human as
it looks rather reptilian.]
