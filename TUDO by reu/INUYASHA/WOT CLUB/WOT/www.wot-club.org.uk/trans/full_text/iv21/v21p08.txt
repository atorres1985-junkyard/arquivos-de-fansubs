Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

[View of Miroku and Sango, in her casual gear, sitting near to each other by
a tree. Miroku is looking off into the distance, but Sango is sort of shyly
looking at Miroku.]
<Title:    YAMA no NAKA no HIME>
Title: The Lady in the Mountain

(    'hime' normally means 'princess'. However, in the Sengoku Jidai, it was
rather like there were many small kingdoms, even though there was still an
emperor, which also means there are a lot more women with the title of
'hime-sama'. So, for this era translating 'hime' as 'princess' seems
incorrect, but it still basically referrs to a high-ranking noblewoman.)

[View of a forest on a hill.]

Miroku: {off} The men who entered the mountain didn't return?

[View of three crying village women.]
<village woman#1:    YOUKAI ni taburakasareta ni CHIGAinai n-degozai masu.>
village woman#1: It's possible they were tricked by a Youkai.
<village woman#2:    douka oTASUke o...>

[Wider view of the group, standing near the outskirts out a village.]
<Kagome:    ii ja nai no, INUYASHA.>
Kagome: It's okay isn't it, Inuyasha.
<Miroku:    goTEISHU-TACHI ga KAEran no dewa KOKOROBOSOkarou.>
Miroku: You feel helpless with your husbands not returning don't you.

<Sango:    minna de Ikeba, sugu SUmu desho.>
Sango: If we all go, it'll be finished soon.

[Inuyasha still looks a bit annoyed.]
<Inuyasha:    ma, do-se, ore ga Todome sasanakya Owanne- daro- kara na.>
Inuyasha: Well, I bet I'll be the one who has to finish it off, of course.
<Kagome:    so- yo.>

looking a bit annoyed.]

<Sango:    atarimae daro!?>
Sango: Are you kidding!?

3
[Closeup of Sango looking round.]
<Sango:    ONNAZUki no HOUSHI-sama hitori ja,>
Sango: Alone that lustful houshi-sama,
<Sango:    GYAKU ni YOUKAI ni toriTSUkareru no ga Ochi da yo.>
Sango: will get possessed by that Youkai instead, is the point.

4
[After Sango's left, Kagome sidles up to Inuyasha.]
<Kagome:    ne-, INUYASHA.>
Kagome: Say, Inuyasha.
<Kagome:    WATASHI OMOu n-dakedo-.>
Kagome: This is what I think though.

[Closeup of Inuyasha looking a bit surprised.]
<Inuyasha:    ha-?>
Inuyasha: Huh?
<Inuyasha:    nan ja sorya.>
Inuyasha: Whadda ya mean?

3
[Kagome is looking at Inuyasha in surprise, who looks a bit nervous. Shippou
is also looking at Inuyasha in surprise.]
<Kagome:    tte, anta KIzuitenai no?>
Kagome: Meaning, you didn't notice?
<Inuyasha:    e".>
Inuyasha: _Eh_.
<Shippou:    ora wa usuusu KANzuite otta zo.>
Shippou: I had this vague feeling.

4
[Scene change to a view of a forest.]
Fx leaves: rustle... <Zawa...>

5
[Miroku and Sango are walking through a forest with high undergrowth. Miroku
is ahead sighing, and Sango is looking at him in annoyance.]
Fx Miroku: *si-i-i-i-igh* <ha---->
<Sango:    chotto.>
Sango: Hey.
<Sango:    nani tameIKI tsuite n-no sa.>
Sango: What are you sighing for huh?

[Sango catches up to Miroku.]
<Sango:    wakatte n-no? YOUKAI TAIJI nanda kara...>
Sango: You understand right? We're exterminating the Youkai...
<Miroku:    hai.>
Miroku: Yes.

2
[View of the forest.]
<Sango:    MURA no HITO no HANASHI da to MUKASHI, kono YAMA no NAKA ni...>
Sango: {off} According to the villagers' story, a long time ago on this mountain...

3
[View of a group of armoured men (guards and warriors) walking through the forest.]
<Sango:    IKUSA ni MAkete NIgenobita OchiMUSHA-TACHI ga, SUmi tsuita rashii yo.>
Sango: {voice over} Some warriors who escaped after losing a war, settled down here apparently.
<Sango:    mottomo minna KIZUtsuite-te, NAGAIki shinakatta rashii kedo...>
Sango: Naturally, they were all wounded, and it seems they didn't live long...

4
[Drawing of a woman with long black hair in rich looking clothes in a cave.
Her head is back to us and we can't see her face.]
<Sango:    sono NAKA ni ISSHO ni Ochinobita HIME ga ite,>
Sango: {voice over} However, there was a lady who escaped with them,
<Sango:    SAIGO no IkiNOKOri ni natta n-dakedo,>
Sango: but she became the last one alive,
<Sango:    MAMOtte kureru HITO ga hitori mo inaku natte...>
Sango: so there wasn't a single person left to protect her...

(    This lady would logically be the daughter (or wife) of whichever lord lost
the war...)

5
[Back to Sango and Miroku.]
<Sango:    KEKKYOKU, sono mama SHInjatta n-da tte.>
Sango: In the end, she died like that apparently.
<Miroku:    ha-,>

<Miroku:    suru to...>
Miroku: so...

something ahead.]

Miroku: Can you see it Sango?
<Sango:    e...>
Sango: Yeah...

[View of the forest ahead, which seems to be distorted as though through a
lens. There is a glow ahead as well.]
Fx light: *glow...* <Bo----...>
<Miroku:    achira e no IriGUCHI da.>
Miroku: {off} _That_ is the entrance.
<Miroku:    shikamo kono KEKKAI...>

5
[Closeup of Miroku.]
<Miroku:    HAIru no wa tayasui ga, DEru no wa MUZUKAshisou da.>
Miroku: seems to be easy to enter, but hard to leave.

6
[Miroku seems serious but Sango looks at him slightly surprised.]
<Miroku:    SANGO, yahari omae wa HIkiKAEse.>
Miroku: Sango, I think you should go back.
<Sango:    yada yo.>
Sango: No way.

7
[Miroku turns to Sango.]
<Miroku:    ano ne,>
Miroku: Hey,
<Miroku:    WATASHI wa omae no MI o ANjite...>

<Miroku:    NANIka no YAKU ni tatsu deshou.>
Miroku: It'll help against some things.
Fx rosary: clatter <Ja_>

(    This speaker uses more formal language.)



Page 12

[It's a noble-woman - long black hair, rich looking kimono etc. However, her
eyes are all black except for a white angled bar in each eye. Doesn't
appear to be entirely human...]
Fx youkai: *walking over ground...* <Saku...>
<youkai:    doushite kono you na YAMA no NAKA ni...?>
youkai: What are you doing in a mountain like this...?

3
[Closeup of the old man.]
<old man:    ore wa...>
old man: I'm...
<old man:    jijii ja nee you.>
old man: not a jijii.

(    'jii-san' is 'grandad' or a general term of address to an old man. 'jijii'
is similar, but the sort of thing Inuyasha would say - ie 'old fart'.)

4
[Closeup of Sango looking surprised.]
<Sango:    e...?>
Sango: Eh...?

<old man#2:    un... TANOshikatta na...>

<youkai:    hai... soshite...>
youkai: Yes... then...
<youkai:    TOMO no MONO wa mina SHI ni mashita.>
youkai: all my companions died.

3
[View of the Youkai lady with her eyes closed and a tear in her right eye.]
<youkai:    WATASHI wa hitori...>
youkai: I was by myself...
<youkai:    samishii no desu...>

4
[Sango is rushing along with Kirara at her side.]
<old man:    ATAMA ga Bo-tto shite, NANImokamo dou demo YOku nacchimatte...>
old man: your mind goes blank, and you don't care about anything anymore...
Fx Sango: swish <Za_>
<Sango:    ttaku...>

4
[Scene change back to Inuyasha and Kagome, who seem to be arguing. Shippou
is looking bored.]
<Inuyasha:    datte yo-, SANGO no yatsu MIROKU ni SHIRI naderareru to OKOru sho.>
Inuyasha: But, Sango gets angry when Miroku caresses her bottom.
<Kagome:    ano ne- ONNA no KO wa Mu-do o TAISETSU ni suru IkiMONO na no.>
Kagome: Hey, a girl is someone who values the "mood".
<Shippou:    ora mou kono GIRON ni akita...>
Shippou: .oO(I've gotten tired of this discussion already...).


(    By the way, Kagome literally says "mood", the imported english word...)
