Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

Kagura: ...Is what you want me to say, however...
Fx fan: fwap <Ba_>

(    This style Kagura uses of saying something then denying it (to be ironic)
is kinda common. The impression is somewhat like "you did well to avoid the
last one, but what about the next?" - ie the speaker was holding back previously.)

[Kagura picks up the glowing fragments.]
<Kagura:    sateto...>
Kagura: Now then...
Fx Kagura: *reach out...* <Su...>

Page 18

[Kagura rushes up into the night sky on a large feather.]
Fx Kagura: whoosh <Go_>

2
[Closeup of Miroku watching this and Sango looking down towards the ground.]
<Miroku:    NIgeta.>
Miroku: She ran.
Sango: !
<Sango:    HOUSHI-sama KOUGA ga...>
Sango: Houshi-sama, Kouga is...

3
[Kouga's two friends have come beside him.]
<wolf-man patch:    KOUGA omae ASHI o...>
wolf-man patch: Kouga, your legs are...
<Kouga:    chi... chikushou_.>
Kouga: Da... dammit!

4
[Kagome, Inuyasha and Shippou are here too.]
<Kagome:    SHIKON no kekera o torareta n-da wa.>
Kagome: His Shikon fragments were taken.
<Shippou:    do, dou suru n-ja.>
Shippou: Wh, what'll we do.

5
[Closeup of Inuyasha speaking forcefully.]
<Inuyasha:    KImatte n-ja nee ka...>
