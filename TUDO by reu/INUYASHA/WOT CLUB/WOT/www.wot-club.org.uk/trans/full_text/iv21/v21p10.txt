Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

They're all looking forwards with rather serious though slightly varied expressions.]

[View of a group of bandits rushing along. There's about 5 to 10 on
horseback, and several on foot, one of whom is pulling a cart with two tied
up women and some barrels or similar]
Fx horses: (hoves) rumble... <Dodododo>
<bandit:    SAKE mo ONNA mo TE ni haitta.>

<bandit:    oKASHIRA, KONYA wa Pa-tto iki mashou ya.>

[View of the lead bandit noticing something ahead. (presumably the boss
given that he has finer looking armour)]
<bandit:    n!?>
bandit: Hm!?

3
[Up ahead on the group is a large black mound.]
Fx mound: *pulse...* <Dokun...>

4
[The bandits stop before the mound - it appears to be a large round piece of
flesh - it's dark coloured and has what appears to be veins over it. (it
almost looks like a large brain, though it isn't ridged the same)]
Fx mound: *pulse...* <Dokun...>
<bandit:    nanda korya.>
bandit: What's this thing.

[View of the mound as spears and swords are stuck into it.]

[A (human looking) hand and arm comes out of the mound of flesh holding one
of the swords by the blade.]
Fx sword: *squeeze* <Gyu_>
Fx arm: *slide out* <Zuru>
bandit: {off} !?

4
[The bandits look on in shock as a man with longish and somewhat wild black
hair comes out. His back is to us and a large spider-mark is clearly
visible on the back, as well as sword stuck into his shoulder.]
Fx man: *rise* <Zu_>
<bandit:    na...!?>
bandit: Wha...!?



Page 4

[View from the front of the man getting out of the flesh. However, darkness
is shadowing his face and we can't see any features.]

[Closeup of Inuyasha rushing along.]
<Inuyasha:    aa, MACHIGAinee kocchi da!>
Inuyasha: Yeah, it's definitely coming from this direction!

3
[Inuyasha and the group arrive the scene with the bandits. It seems everyone
is dead - all the bandits are lying face down in pools of blood.]
Fx group: shh <Za_>
group: !

[Closeup of Shippou and Kagome.]
<Shippou:    mi... MINAGOROshi ja.>

[Miroku is holding a young woman (probably one kidnaped by the bandits) who
is staring straight ahead in terror and shivering.]

[Scene change to a view of some trees.]
Fx leaves: rustle... <Sawa...>

2
[The man from earlier (well, Youkai, since he's one of Naraku's offspring)
is kneeling beside a river, still naked. He has his hands to his face.
There is a horse tethered to a tree nearby as well as a pile of armour and
various weapons.]
Fx water: slish... <Za...>

[The face is discarded, thrown to the river bank where some previously
discarded faces are.]

[Somebody approaches the Youkai from behind - we see part of the leg, and
the person seems to be wearing fairly rich looking robes.]
Fx person: shh <Za_>



Page 8

[It's a Buddhist priest - quite a young one actually (early twenties?), with
a shaven head and those bowl shaped hats Buddhist priests sometimes wear.
This priest is rather fresh-faced looking - even has a beauty spot under
his left eye. He's carrying what appears to be an antler (some kind of
prong-shaped weapon) attached to the end of a pole.]
<priest:    JAKI no MOTO wa omae ka.>
priest: So you're the origin of the evil huh.
<priest:    MONO no KE...>
priest: Evil spirit...

2
[The Youkai turns around and we get to see his naked face. There's nothing
there - just what appears to be a huge scar - not even a mouth or nose or eyes.]
Fx youkai: hshht... <Shu--->
Fx youkai: rustle... <Zawa...>

3
[Behind the priest is another one, though he appears to be a boy, and is
carrying a large pack.]
<boy priest:    MUSOU-sama, oKI o tsukete...>
boy priest: Musou-sama, be careful...
<Musou:    sagatte ore.>
Musou: Stand back.

(    'Musou' means "peerless", "unparalleled" etc...)

4
[Closeup side view of Musou.]
<Musou:    MONO no KE, kisama doko kara KIta.>
Musou: Evil spirit, where did you come from?
<Musou:    naze kono you na mugoi koto o suru.>
Musou: Why do such an atrocious thing?

[View of the Youkai.]

[Closeup of the Youkai.]
<youkai:    doko kara... KIta...?>
youkai: .oO(Where did I... come from...?).
<youkai:    SHIra...nee.>
youkai: Don't... know.

2
[The Youkai moves towards the priest.]
Fx youkai: hshht... <Shu-->
<youkai:    KAO... yokose...>
youkai: Give me... your face...

3
[Musou readies his weapon, looking a bit annoyed.]
<Musou:    kono GO ni oyonde mada Iu ka.>
Musou: So, you resist despite your actions.
<Musou:    naraba...>
Musou: In that case...
Fx Musou: shh <Za_>

4
[As the Youkai reaches out towards him, Musou whacks his weapon into the
Youkai's head, caving it in.]
<Musou:    SEIBAIsuru!!>
Musou: I'll punish you!!
Fx youkai: whack <Doga_>

5
[The boy looks on, impressed.]
<boy priest:    yatta...>
boy priest: Got him...



Page 10

[Despite having the weapon embedded right into it's head, the Youkai
continues forwards and puts it's hands around Musou's neck, pushing the
weapon even further into it's head.]
Fx weapon: *sink in...* <Zubu>
Fx youkai: (Musou) *grab* <Ga_>
Musou: !

[Closeup side view of Musou with a shocked expression, and also as if his
head had just jerked upwards.]

[The boy priest runs off.]
Fx boy priest: *tmp tmp...* <Tatata...>
<boy priest:    hii~~_.>
boy priest: Yeeek!

5
[View of the Youkai sitting over the fallen form of Musou.]
<youkai:    MU... SOU.>
youkai: Mu... sou.

6
[A bit later, the Youkai is kneeling next to the river again with his hands
to his face.]
Fx youkai: rustle... <Zawa...>



Page 11
1
[View of the Youkai with his new face - he's taken Musou's face. With his
slightly shaggy longish hair he looks like a rock star from the 1970's or
80's. By the way, he looks entirely human - doesn't even have pointed ears.]
<youkai:    hahaha_.>
youkai: Hahaha!
<youkai:    ore no KAO da!>
youkai: This is my face!

(    Until just now, this Youkai has spoken with the rough voice of a demon (you
can tell from the styling of the words), but now he has the same style as
normal people.)

[Scene change to Inuyasha and the rest of the group rushing along - Kagome

her in terror. In the smoke behind her there is the faint figure of a
person on horse-back seemingly holding a spear.]

Fx child: *wail* <bi-->
<village woman:    hi_ hii~_.>
village woman: Ye, ye~e~k!

3
[A spear is thrown towards the woman who cringes.]
Fx spear: whizz <Byu_>

[Inuyasha chops the spear in time, cutting up the ground as well, which
startles the horse.]

Inuyasha: Sankon Tessou! (Soul Shattering Iron Claw)
Fx spear: whack <Baki>
Fx ground: wham <Doka>
Fx horse: whinny <Buhihi>

[Inuyasha and the 'faceless' Youkai from earlier face off. The guy is on the

back. He looks rather calm.]
