Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

[View of the wolf-man with a black path of hair, putting his hands down in
front of him to keep himself from falling. Near to him is the wolf-man with

<Inuyasha:    HANAshi kakenna KI ga CHIru!>
Inuyasha: Don't talk to me - you're distracting!

2
[Inuyasha continues sniffing at the ground. Behind him, Sango and Miroku
look on. Up ahead, Kagome looks back beside her bike, along with Shippou.]
<Sango:    JIMEN KAidemo NARAKU no SHIRO wa wakannai n-ja nai?>

<Miroku:    nee.>

<Inuyasha:    chikusho~>
Inuyasha: Dammit.

Miroku: Tonight's the day when Inuyasha loses his Youkai-powers and has human form.

(    Hmm, Inuyasha has a "bad hair day" about every 5 volumes (50 chapters).
Pretty regular.)

<Kouga:    omae mo KIte-ta no ka.>
Kouga: So you came too eh.
<Kagome:    ko... KOUGA-kun.>
Kagome: Ko... Kouga-kun.

2
[The view expands a bit. In the wide skid-mark Kouga made as he arrived in
Inuyasha the road-kill, lying face down in the ground, with two foot-prints
on his hair. Everyone is looking at him.]
Fx Inuyasha: clunk... <mishi...>
Miroku: ......

3
[Closeup of Kouga with quite a derisive look, sneering down at Inuyasha.]
<Kouga:    he_ INU_koro, temee mo KAgitsukete KIyagatta no ka.>

Fx Inuyasha: {comically} squish <gusha_>
<Miroku:    KOUGA, SHIRO o tsukitometa no ka.>
Miroku: Kouga, have you traced the castle?
<Kouga:    aa, nanka SHIrane- ga...>

[Closeup of Kouga.]
<Kouga:    NARAKU no YAROU no MUNAkuso WARUi NIOi ga MOrete kite yagaru.>
Kouga: that jerk Naraku's disgusting smell is fucking leaking out.
<Kouga:    IMA made ni nakatta koto da.>
Kouga: It hasn't before.

2
[Sango and Miroku ponder this.]
<Sango:    sore tte...>
Sango: That means...
<Miroku:    SHIRO no KEKKAI ga yurunde iru to iu koto ka?>
Miroku: The barrier around the castle has slackened?

<Inuyasha:    KYOU to iu KYOU wa KECCHAKUtsuketa-ru.>
Inuyasha: Today's the day we'll settle this.
<Kagome:    yametoki nasai tteba.>
Kagome: I'm telling you - stop that.

[Closeup of Kouga.]
<Kouga:    n~?>
Kouga: Hn~n?
<Kouga:    doushita INU_koro.>
Kouga: What's up dog-turd?

[Kouga is now crouched beside Inuyasha.]
Fx Kouga: sniff sniff sniff <fun fun fun>
<Kouga:    nanka omae...>
Kouga: Somehow, you're...

3
[Closeup side view of Kouga.]

<Kouga:    MIZU Abidemo shita no ka yo.>
Kouga: Did you go for a swim or something?

4
[Kagome looks a bit startled/worried and Inuyasha looks a bit nervous.]
Fx Kagome: urkk... <giku...>
<Inuyasha:    na_...>
Inuyasha: Wha...

5
[Kouga's friends and the wolves catch up, finally, all straining.]

<wolf-man spike:    ya, yatto Oitsuita...>

[The wolf-men and wolves trundle past Inuyasha and co. The guy with spiked
hair makes a sort of embarrassed greeting to Kagome.]
Fx wolf group: shh-shh-shh <Za Za Za Za>
<wolf-man patch:    a_.>
wolf-man patch: {noticing Kagome} Ah.

<Kagome:    konnichiwa-.>
Kagome: Hello.

4
[Inuyasha speaks to Miroku angrily.]
<Inuyasha:    fuzakenna, SAKI KOsare chimau zo.>

<Miroku:    Ochitsuki nasai INUYASHA.>
Miroku: Calm down Inuyasha.

5
[Closeup of Inuyasha realising something.]
<Miroku:    KOUGA wa tomokaku NARAKU ni NINGEN no SUGATA o sarasu KI ka?>
Miroku: {off} Kouga is one thing, but do you want to expose your human form to Naraku?



Page 11

[Closeup of Miroku, continuing to explain.]
<Miroku:    HANYOU ga YOURYOKU o USHINAu HI o SHIraretara, INOCHI ni KAKAwaru no darou.>
Miroku: If the day on which a Half-Youkai loses their Youkai-power is found out, their life would be in danger.
<Miroku:    AITE ga NARAKU nara naosara da.>
Miroku: Even more if it's Naraku [that finds out].

[Closeup of Inuyasha, gritting his teeth in anger.]

Inuyasha: .oO(Dam... dammit - why now...).

3
[Scene change. Ripples of evil energy.]

4
[View of a castle at night, with dark energy swirling around.]
Fx scene: rumble... <Goooo...>

5
[Kagura is walking down a corridor in the castle. There are several bleached
skeletons visible, though the clothes are in good shape. None seemed to
have died by violence - several seem to have died while sitting with their
backs to the wall, or lying down.]
Fx floorboards: creak... <Gishi...>
Kagura: ......



Page 12

[Closeup of Kagura with an annoyed expression.]
<Kagura:    _taku, IKI ga tsumarisou da na kono SHIRO wa...>

<Kagura:    KEKKAI no DOKUKE ni Aterarete minna SHInjimatta shi.>
Kagura: were effected by the poison from the barrier and died.

4
[Kagura notices Kanna behind her.]
Kagura: !

5
[Kanna is holding her mirror.]
Fx mirror: *glow...* <Bou...>

6
[Closeup of Kagura looking annoyed.]
<Kagura:    nan da yo KANNA.>
Kagura: What's with you Kanna.
<Kagura:    ikinari USHIro ni TAchi yagatte...>
Kagura: Suddenly standing behind someone like that...



Page 13
1
[Closeup of Kagura looking surprised at something.]
<Kagura:    n!?>
Kagura: Hn!?

2
[In the mirror, Kagura sees a hazy view of Kouga walking through some tall
grass along with some wolves.]

<Kagura:    kono SHIRO no CHIKAku made KIte-ru no ka!?>
Kagura: .oO(He's actually gotten close to the castle!?).

4
[Closeup side view of Kagura thinking.]

Kagura: .oO(A coincidence?).
<Kagura:    soretomo...>
Kagura: .oO(Or could it be...).

5

<Kagura:    oi KANNA.>
Kagura: Hey Kanna.
<Kagura:    NARAKU wa kono koto SHItte n-no ka?>
Kagura: Does Naraku know about this?

6
[Closeup of Kanna.]
<Kanna:    SHIranai...>
Kanna: I don't know...
<Kanna:    inai...>
Kanna: He's not here...



Page 14
1
[Closeup side view of Kagura thinking.]
<Kagura:    fuun...>
Kagura: Hmmm...
<Kagura:    souieba NARAKU no YAROU TOKIDOKI inakunaru na...>
Kagura: .oO(Now that I think about it, that jerk Naraku leaves occationally...).

(    Naraku is a Half-Youkai, but his birth as one was certainly different from
Inuyasha's, so we don't know if Naraku has a day when he loses all his
power, though it's certainly a possibility. It's also possible that Naraku
could loses his power on the night of the new moon too. There's other
reasons why he could have gone, but the fact that the barrier's power is
weak now is interesting...)

2
[Kagura is walking off, with Kanna looking at her from behind.]
<Kanna:    KAGURA...>
Kanna: Kagura...
<Kagura:    tata_KOROshite kuru yo.>
Kagura: .oO(I will kill him.).

is all dark wavey energy.]

Kouga: Dammit - it's definitely in this direction though.
<wolf-man patch:    nannimo MIenee kedo...>
wolf-man patch: But we can't see anything...
<wolf-man spike:    n!?>
wolf-man spike: {looking up} Hn!?

5
[View of what appears to be some kind of swarm in the sky - a dark patch
against the night sky, though there appear to be many skulls there to.]
Fx swarm: shh... <Zawa...>

[Closeup of Kagura with a dark smile.]
<Kagura:    fu_, SHIRO no KEIGO no RENCHUU sa.>

Kouga: Kagura the Wind-User...
<Kouga:    temee no NIKUNIKUshii Tsura ICHINICHI datte WASUreta koto wa nakatta ze.>
Kouga: There hasn't been a single day when I've forgotten about your spiteful face.
<Kouga:    nanishiro NAKAMA-TACHI o YAtta CHOU HONNIN dakara na...>
Kouga: Because, you're directly responsible for killing my friends...

Fx fan: sh <Za_>

[Closeup side view of Kagura smiling.]
<Kagura:    fu_, KOUGA no HAYAsa o FUUjiru nanza KANTAN da.>
