Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

5
[Sango continues on, and Miroku has a sort of amused/depressed look.]
<Sango:    HOUSHI-sama, ONNA ni wa MISAKAinai n-dakara,>
Sango: Houshi-sama, you lose your head when it comes to women,
<Sango:    ZETTAI Sukebe-GOKORO Okosu tte...>
Sango: and your lecherous mind always takes over...

[Sometime later, the group is walking along. Miroku has a large hand-print
on his face, and Kagome is looking at him. Inuyasha is looking at Kagome,
and Shippou is looking at Inuyasha. Up ahead, Sango is walking along with a
sort of depressed melancholy look.]
<Miroku:    shikashi sawatte kure to Iwan bakara no TAISEI de shita shi...>
Miroku: But with that posture it was like she was asking to be touched...
<Kagome:    MIROKU-sama...>
Kagome: Miroku-sama...
<Kagome:    ONNA yori mo OTOMEGOKORO no BENKYOU shita hou ga ii kamo.>
Kagome: Maybe you should learn a girl's heart before a woman's.
<Inuyasha:    yappa kagome no KANCHIGAi daro!?>
Inuyasha: Kagome, you were actually wrong, weren't you!?
<Inuyasha:    na_.>
Inuyasha: Right?
<Inuyasha:    na_.>
