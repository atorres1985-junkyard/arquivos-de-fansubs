Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

Toutousai: Inuyasha,
<Toutousai:    RYUUKOSSEI o KIre.>
Toutousai: slay the Ryuukossei.

(    This approximately translates as "dragon-bone-spirit". (I'm not too sure
about the 'spirit' part though...))

<Toutousai:    INUYASHA, omae no oyaji-dono ga TATAKAtte FUUINshita YOUKAI sa.>
Toutousai: is a Youkai your oyaji-dono fought and sealed, Inuyasha.

Toutousai: Inuyasha, why do you think the newer Tetsusaiga is heavy?

3
[Inuyasha is walking along through a misty forest, though the trees have
very few leaves.]
<Toutousai:    sore wa KATANA ni UchiKOnda omae no KIBA ga,>
Toutousai: {flashback} It's because that fang of yours embedded into the sword,
<Toutousai:    oyaji-dono no KIBA no TSUYOsa ni Oitsuitenai kara da.>
Toutousai: can't catch up with your oyaji-dono's fang's strength.

[Closeup side view of Inuyasha.]
<Inuyasha:    tsumari, oyaji ga TATAKAtta YOUKAI o buttaGIreba,>
Inuyasha: In other words, if I rip-apart the Youkai oyaji fought,
<Inuyasha:    oyaji o KOerareru tte RIKUTSU ka.>
Inuyasha: in theory I can surpass oyaji huh.
<Myouga:    buttaGIru to MOUshimashitemo,>
Myouga: There's no need to "rip-apart".

2
[Closeup of Myouga.]
<Myouga:    yoroshii ka, INUYASHA-sama.>
Myouga: Listen, Inuyasha-sama...
<Myouga:    FUUINshita mama no RYUUKOSSEI no SHIN no ZOU o TSURANUku dake de ii n-desu kara na.>
Myouga: While Ryuukossei is sealed, just piercing it's heart will do.

3
[Closeup of Inuyasha looking down at Myouga, who panics somewhat.]
<Inuyasha:    TATAKAu n-ja nee no ka yo.>
Inuyasha: I won't fight it then?
<Myouga:    tondemonai_.>
Myouga: Don't be ridiculous!

4
[Side view of Inuyasha walking along through the forest, almost looking
depressed, while Myouga is rather agitated.]

Myouga: Even when your chichi-gimi finally sealed the Youkai...
<Myouga:    Todome o sashi-kirenakatta YOUKAI desu zo.>
Myouga: he couldn't finish it off.
<Inuyasha:    shikkashi sonna NEKUBIkaku mite- na...>
Inuyasha: But, that's just like killing someone in their sleep...

5
[View from up in a tree of Inuyasha and Myouga. A Saimyoushou is sitting on
the branch...]
<Myouga:    gudaguda nukasu to ANNAIshimanse zo_.>
Myouga: Stop complaining or I won't show you the way!
<Inuyasha:    teme- DARE ni KUCHIkiite n-da_, ore ni ka!?>

[Scene change to a view of some trees.]
<Miroku:    shikashi TOUTOUSAI-sama.>
Miroku: {off} But Toutousai-sama...

4
[The group is sitting around a camp-fire, with Toutousai leaning back
against that ox of his.]
<Miroku:    sonna HOUHOU ga aru no nara, doushite HAYAku OSHIete yaranakatta no de?>
Miroku: If there was such a way, why didn't you tell him earlier?
<Toutousai:    KANTANsugiru daro- ga yo.>
Toutousai: It'd be too easy wouldn't it.

5
[Closeup side view of Toutousai.]
<Toutousai:    Raku-shite TSUKAeru yo- ni nattemo, MI ni tsukanee kara na--->
Toutousai: Also, even if he got to use it easily, he wouldn't master it ...

6
[Closeup of Kagome looking sad.]
<Kagome:    demo... INUYASHA wa juubun KURUshi n-da wa.>
Kagome: But... Inuyasha is really suffering.



Page 11

[Miroku and Kagome face Toutousai.]
<Miroku:    ikura AITE ga YATOU to wa ie,>
Miroku: Even though they were bandits,
<Miroku:    NINGEN o TE ni kakete shimatta no desu kara na.>
Miroku: he did kill human beings.
<Toutousai:    fun.>
Toutousai: Humph.

2
[Closeup of Toutousai making a point.]
<Toutousai:    dakara OSHIete yatta n-ja nee ka.>
Toutousai: That's why I told him.
<Toutousai:    HITO o TE ni kakete HEIKI na yatsu ni, TETSUSAIGA o MOtsu SHIKAKU wa nee kara na.>
Toutousai: Someone who's okay with killing humans, isn't qualified to carry Tetsusaiga.

3
[Scene change back to the dead-ish forest. In the distance a high cliff-face
can be seen.]
Fx wind: whoosh... <Hyu--...>

4
[Inuyasha is walking up a hill.]
Fx Inuyasha: shh... <Za...>
<Myouga:    INUYASHA-sama, asoko ja.>
Myouga: Inuyasha-sama, it's over there.

5
[View a cliff-face in the distance, obscured by mist. However, there seems
to be some large, snake like creature on the vertical cliff-face.]
<Myouga:    RYUUKOSSEI wa ano Gage ni...>
Myouga: {off} Ryuukossei is on that cliff...



Page 12
1
[View of Ryuukossei, and Inuyasha on a ridge opposit it. It is a huge
dragon, but on the dragon's forehead is another 'face', which is like a
white mask with a humanoid face, with the eyes closed. Ryuukossei's dragon
eyes are open, but blank. Most of the long thick body is actually inside
the cliff, and only some parts are sticking out - the head, and two claws.
A short distance from the head is a large white claw, stuck into the body.
Moss is covering most of the body as well.]
Fx wind: whoosh... <Hyuuuu...>
Fx Inuyasha: shh... <Za...>



Page 13

[Closeup of Inuyasha, with Myouga on his head.]
<Myouga:    ano FUUIN... CHICHI-GIMI no TSUME ga SAsatte iru TOKORO,>
Myouga: Where that seal... your chichi-gimi's claw is stuck in,
<Myouga:    asoko ga RYUUKOSSEI no SHIN no ZOU ja.>
Myouga: that is where Ryuukossei's heart is.

(    Btw, I'm not sure what the plan is once Ryuukossei has been slain. Take
Inuyasha's father's claw, and use that to improve Tetsusaiga?)

2
[Closeup of the claw.]
Fx wind: whoosh... <Hyu--->

3
[A shadowy figure appears on the edge of the claw.]
Fx figure: *suddenly appear...* <Chira...>

4
[Closeup of Inuyasha looking surprised.]
Inuyasha: !?



Page 14

[Naraku, in the baboon pelt is sitting on the claw, which is easily bigger
than a door.]
Fx Naraku: shhh <Za...>
<Naraku:    kukuku...>
Naraku: Kukuku...

2
[Closeup of Inuyasha looking shocked.]
<Inuyasha:    NARAKU...>
Inuyasha: Naraku...

Fx claw: *fall apart* <Boro Boro Boro>

5
[Inuyasha watches, but Myouga panics.]
<Myouga:    gee_, FUUIN ga...>
Myouga: Ack! The seal is...



Page 16

[The scenery around Ryuukossei goes all dark and menacing.]
Fx Ryuukossei: *pulse of energy...* <Dokun...>
Fx claw: hshht... <Shu--->

2
[The eyes on the mask-like face open and look to the side (where Inuyasha
is), and the Dragon eyes are open and away too.]
Fx eyes: *glare...* <Giro...>



Page 17

[Naraku stands at the top of the cliff, as Ryuukossei turns towards Inuyasha.]
<Naraku:    kukuku... RYUUKOSSEI yo,>
Naraku: Kukuku... Ryuukossei,
<Naraku:    soko ni iru no wa, kisama o FUUINshita NIKUi OTOKO no MUSUKO da.>
Naraku: over there is the son of the hated man who sealed you.
<Naraku:    ZONBUN ni TATAKAu ga ii.>
Naraku: Go and fight to your heart's content.

2
[Inuyasha is looking up off at where Naraku is, while rocks fall around him.]
Fx rocks: clatter... <Gararara...>
Inuyasha: !

3
[Inuyasha looks at Myouga, who's panicing on his shoulder.]
<Myouga:    i, ikan.>
Myouga: O, oh no.
<Myouga:    NIgemashou INUYASHA-sama.>
Myouga: Let's escape Inuyasha-sama.
<Inuyasha:    ke_, nani NE-Boke-te yagaru.>
Inuyasha: Bah, what are you gibbering on about.

4
[Closeup side view of Inuyasha.]
<Inuyasha:    SAISHO kara, ore wa FUUINsarete-ru yatsu o, kosokoso TSUttsuku you na yariKATA...>
Inuyasha: From the start, to sneakily stab someone while sealed...
<Inuyasha:    KI ni kuwanakatta n-da!>
Inuyasha: is a style I can't stomach!



Page 18

[Inuyasha swings out transformed Tetsusaiga.]
<Inuyasha:    SHOUMEN kara bu_TAOshite...>
Inuyasha: I'll beat it from the front...
<Inuyasha:    TETSUSAIGA o KARUkushite yarou ja nee ka_.>
Inuyasha: and make Tetsusaiga lighter!
Fx Tetsusaiga: *massive weight...* <Zuuun...>
