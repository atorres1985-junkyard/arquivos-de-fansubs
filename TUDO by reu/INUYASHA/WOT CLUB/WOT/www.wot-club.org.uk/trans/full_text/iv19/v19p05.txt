Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

<Title:    HENGE no HIMITSU>
Title: The Secret of the Transformation

(    The Japanese word used for here is 'henge', and in some ways is rather
closer to 'demonification' (turning into a demon, or demon like creature).
I've used the more general 'transformation' instead because
'demonification' is rather too specific.)

[Rin, Jaken and Sesshoumaru are walking through a forest. It seems rather
lush, bushes and trees everywhere, though a sun-beam is shining down on the
group. Rin is riding on the two-headed dragon like thing Sesshoumaru uses
in place of a horse...]
<Jaken:    CHICHI-GIMI no oSHIriAI ga, konna HENpi na MORI no NAKA ni?>
Jaken: Your chichi-gimi's acquaintance is in such a remote forest?
Fx Sesshoumaru: shh... <Za...>
Sesshoumaru: ......

(    The 'gimi' on 'chichi-gimi' is a somewhat old-fashioned respectful term
Jaken uses for Sesshoumaru's father. (Even old for the Sengoku Jidai, I think...))

2
[View of the top of a tree.]
Fx leaves: rustle... <Zawa...>
<voice:    sorosoro TAZUnete kuru KORO da to OMOtto-tta...>
voice: I thought you'd be coming to visit me sometime soon...
<voice:    SESSHOUMARU...>
voice: Sesshoumaru...

3
[Rin and Jaken look up in surprise.]
<Rin:    SORA kara KOE ga...>
Rin: A voice came from the sky...
<Jaken:    n"~?>
Jaken: _Hn_?
<Jaken:    nanimo oran zo.>
Jaken: There's nothing here.

4
[Closeup of Sesshoumaru, looking up slightly.]
<Sesshoumaru:    WATASHI ga KURU to wakatte ita da to...?>
Sesshoumaru: You know why I've come...
<Sesshoumaru:    BOKUSENOU.>
Sesshoumaru: Bokusenou?

(    "Bokusenou" ('boku-sen-ou') is a name, where 'boku' means gentle (and is
also a type of tree, magnolia hypoleuca), 'sen' is a hermit/wizard, and
'ou' means 'old man'.)

1
[Sesshoumaru is standing before a large tree. (btw, he has both Tenseiga and
the new one, Toukijin, at his left side, though the latter isn't in a scabbard.]
Fx tree: crackle, snap... <Paki Paki Paki...>
<Bokusenou:    washi no TOKORO ni KIta to iu koto wa,>
Bokusenou: That you've come to see me means that,
<Bokusenou:    KATANA no HANASHI de arou.>
Bokusenou: you've come about the swords, haven't you.

2
[A face appears on the trunk of the tree.]
Fx face: plock <Boko_>
<Bokusenou:    oyaji-dono no KATAMI, TETSUSAIGA no koto ka?>
Bokusenou: It's about your oyaji-dono's memento, Tetsusaiga huh?
<Bokusenou:    soretomo...>
Bokusenou: Or is it...

(    'oyaji-dono' is Bokusenou's way of saying 'father'. Toutousai uses this too.)

3
[Rin and Jaken are surprised.]
<Rin:    wa_, KI no oBAke.>
Rin: Wah! The spirit of a tree.
<Jaken:    SESSHOUMARU-sama, koyatsu ittai...>
Jaken: Sesshoumaru-sama, who on earth is this...

4
[View of Sesshoumaru.]
<Sesshoumaru:    JYUREI NISENNEN no HOO no KI da.>
Sesshoumaru: A 2000 year old magnolia hypoleuca tree.
<Jaken:    hoo?>
Jaken: Really?

(    As a standalone word, 'magnolia hypoleuca' in Japanese is just 'hoo'. Jaken
says 'hoo?' in response, but in this context it just is an interjection
which doesn't translate very well - somewhere between 'hmm' and 'wow'.
(seems to be a minor pun...))

[Closeup of Bokusenou's face on the trunk - he has a vaguely humanoid face
(eyes, nose, mouth, chin etc), but quite old looking.]
<Bokusenou:    sou sa, soshite SESSHOUMARU no oyaji-dono no KATAMI no KATANA...>
Bokusenou: Indeed, and also the scabbards of Sesshoumaru's oyaji-dono's memento swords...
<Bokusenou:    TETSUSAIGA to TENSEIGA no SAYA wa,>
Bokusenou: Tetsusaiga and Tenseiga,
<Bokusenou:    kono washi no EDA kara KEZUri DAsareta MONO.>
Bokusenou: were carved from branches of mine.

2
[Closeup of Jaken.]
<Jaken:    SAYA...>
Jaken: The scabbards...

3
[Sesshoumaru looks at the tree.]
<Sesshoumaru:    BOKUSENOU, kisama nara SHItte iru darou.>
Sesshoumaru: Bokusenou, you'd know wouldn't you.

(    Note, Sesshoumaru uses the same rude form of 'you' he uses with pretty much everyone...)

4
[Closeup of Sesshoumaru.]
<Sesshoumaru:    INUYASHA to TETSUSAIGA no KAKAwari o.>
Sesshoumaru: The connection between Inuyasha and Tetsusaiga, that is.

5
[Closeup side view of Bokusenou's face.]
<Bokusenou:    INUYASHA...>
Bokusenou: Inuyasha...
<Bokusenou:    onushi no OTOUTO ka...>
Bokusenou: You're younger brother huh...



Page 5
1
[Closeup side view of Sesshoumaru.]
<Sesshoumaru:    ICHIDO-ME wa ONI ni TETSUSAIGA o KAmiKUDAkareta TOKI...>
Sesshoumaru: The first time was when Tetsusaiga was bitten apart by an Oni...
<Sesshoumaru:    NIDO-ME wa, WATASHI to no TATAKAi de TETSUSAIGA o TEBANAshita TOKI.>
Sesshoumaru: The second time was when he relinquished Tetsusaiga in a battle with me.

2
[Flashback drawing to when Inuyasha was battling with Sesshoumaru. When he
was sitting there looking very sinister...]
<Sesshoumaru:    INUYASHA no CHI ga KAwatta.>
Sesshoumaru: Inuyasha's blood changed.

3
[Closeup side view of Sesshoumaru, making a point, though he doesn't look
too happy about it.]
<Sesshoumaru:    HANYOU no CHI no NIOi kara...>
Sesshoumaru: It went from a Half-Youkai's blood's smell...
<Sesshoumaru:    WATASHI ya CHICHI-UE to ONAji, YOUKAI no CHI no NIOi ni.>
Sesshoumaru: to the same Youkai's blood's smell of mine and chichi-ue's.

4
[Bokusenou grows a hand which it uses to rub it's chin.]
Fx arm: plock <Boko_>
Fx bark: crackle... <Paki...>
<Bokusenou:    ONAji YOUKAI no CHI... ka.>
Bokusenou: The _same Youkai's_ blood... huh.
<Bokusenou:    soitsu wa dou ka na.>
Bokusenou: I wonder about that.

5
[View of Sesshoumaru.]
Sesshoumaru: ......
<Sesshoumaru:    dou iu koto da?>
Sesshoumaru: What do you mean?

[View of a village down in a valley.]

2
[View of Kagome on her bike smiling, with Shippou in the basket looking down
at this.]
<Kagome:    a_, MURA ga MIeta.>
Kagome: Ah, you can see the village.

3
[Bringing up the rear is Inuyasha, carrying an old man on his back, and not
looking very happy about it. Sango is to the side, and a young boy is
looking up at the old man. It seems the two had been foraging for food etc,
as they're both carrying baskets on their backs.]
<village boy:    yokatta na- jicchan.>
village boy: We made it, jicchan.
<old man:    ha~ TASUkatta.>
old man: Ahh, I'm saved.
Fx Inuyasha: *sulk sulk sulk* <buchi buchi buchi>

4
[White frame.]
<old man:    arigato gozee mashita.>
old man: I'm very grateful,
<old man:    ASHI o kujiite NANGIshite-ru tokoro o...>
old man: [for your help] after spraining my leg and in pain...

5
[The old man and boy stop to look at Kagome at the outskirts of the village.]
<Kagome:    ja, oDAIJI ni ne.>
Kagome: Okay, take care.
<old man:    hee,>
old man: Sure...
<village boy:    arigatou onee-chan.>
village boy: Thank you onee-chan.

(    'Jicchan' is just a variation of 'jii-chan' (grandad), and though
'onee-chan' means 'big sister', it is often used in situations like this -
by younger children to teenage girls or young women. It's a bit like saying
'Miss', instead of using the person's name.)



Page 7
1
[The boy, who is drawing in a slightly comical style (always smiling, with
just two black dots for eyes), reaches into his clothes.]
<village boy:    a_, sore kara BAkeINU no onii-chan.>
village boy: Ah, and then, monster-dog onii-chan...

2
[Kagome smiles at Inuyasha to calm him down.]
<Inuyasha:    BAkeINU_...>
Inuyasha: Monster-dog...!
Fx Inuyasha: {comically} *get angry* <piki_>
<Kagome:    INUYASHA.>
Kagome: Inuyasha.

3
[The boy places something in Inuyasha's hand.]
<village boy:    oREI ni ora no TAKARAMONO age masu.>
village boy: In thanks, I'll give you my treasured item.

4
[The boy and old man leave.]
<village boy:    sainara-.>
village boy: Good-bye!

5
[Kagome waves merrily, while the others cluster around Inuyasha to see what
he's got.]
<Miroku:    nani moratta n-desu?>
Miroku: What did you get?
<Sango:    Hebi no NUke-Gara...>
Sango: A snake's cast-off skin...
<Shippou:    wa-_, ii na-.>
Shippou: Wow, lucky!

6
[View of the sky. (time passes...)]

7
[Closeup of Inuyasha looking annoyed.]
<Inuyasha:    _taku,>
Inuyasha: Sheesh,
<Inuyasha:    HITODASUke nanza shite-ru Hima nee tte no ni.>
Inuyasha: even though we got no time to spare on helping people!

8
[The group is walking down a path through a forest. Shippou is in the basket
on Kagome's bike, looking happy - looks like he got the snake skin.]
<Kagome:    da-tte, ARUku tsuide da shi-.>
Kagome: But, we just walked with them.
<Miroku:    omae wa ii koto o shita ato, KANARAzu FUKIGEN ni nari masu na.>
Miroku: After doing something good, you always get sullen, don't you.
<Inuyasha:    ke_.>
Inuyasha: Bah!

[Closeup of Inuyasha suddenly stopping.]
<Inuyasha:    n!?>
Inuyasha: Hn!?
Fx Inuyasha: *twitch* <Piku_>

2
[Kagome looks at Inuyasha, slightly worried.]
<Kagome:    INUYASHA...?>
Kagome: Inuyasha...?
<Inuyasha:    HITO no CHI no NIOi da.>
Inuyasha: It's the smell of people's blood.

3
[View of Miroku and Sango.]
<Inuyasha:    kanari no NINZUU da.>
Inuyasha: {off} Quite a number of people.
<Inuyasha:    sore ni HI to KEMURI...>
Inuyasha: There's fire and smoke too...

4
[Closeup of Inuyasha looking back.]
<Inuyasha:    sakki no jijii to Gaki no MURA no HOU ja nee ka!?>
Inuyasha: .oO(It's from the village of that old fart and kid from earlier isn't it!?).
<Inuyasha:    nanika ni OSOwareta!?>
Inuyasha: .oO(They were attacked by something!?).

5
[Scene change - view of some trees.]

6
[Sesshoumaru and the others look at the tree.]
<Bokusenou:    INUYASHA wa AYAKASHI to HITO no AIDA ni Umareta HANYOU...>
Bokusenou: Inuyasha is a Half-Youkai born between a Youkai and human...
<Bokusenou:    SHIN no YOUKAI ni wa nariEnu.>
Bokusenou: and can't become a true Youkai.



Page 9

[Closeup of the tree.]
<Bokusenou:    SUKUnakutomo SESSHOUMARU,>
Bokusenou: At any rate, Sesshoumaru,
<Bokusenou:    KANZEN naru YOUKAI dearu onushi ni wa dekiru ga...>
Bokusenou: there is something you as a perfect Youkai can do, but...
<Bokusenou:    INUYASHA ni wa dekinu koto ga aru.>
Bokusenou: Inuyasha can not do.

2
[Misty frame.]
<Bokusenou:    sore wa...>
Bokusenou: That is...
<Bokusenou:    ONORE o TAMOtsu koto sa...>
Bokusenou: preservation of the self, you see...

(    Ie preservation of your mind, thoughts, feelings etc.)

3
[Closeup of Sesshoumaru.]
<Sesshoumaru:    ONORE o TAMOtsu...?>
Sesshoumaru: preservation of the self...?

4
[Side view of Bokusenou.]
<Bokusenou:    sou sa, tatoeba SESSHOUMARU...>
Bokusenou: Indeed, for example Sesshoumaru...
<Bokusenou:    onushi wa TATAKAi no NAKA de, dono you ni Oitsumerare you to,>
Bokusenou: when in the middle of battle, no matter how pressed you were,
<Bokusenou:    KOKORO wa SAmeta mama...>
Bokusenou: though your mind was cool...
<Bokusenou:    JIBUN o MIUSHINAu koto wa nakarou?>
Bokusenou: have you ever lost yourself?

5
[Sesshoumaru looks back.]
<Sesshoumaru:    fun,>
Sesshoumaru: Humph,
<Sesshoumaru:    WATASHI ga Oitsumerareru koto nado, ari wa shinai ga na.>
Sesshoumaru: being pressed, is not something that's happened to me.
<Bokusenou:    kukuku... sou kamo shiren na.>
Bokusenou: Kukuku... maybe that's so.

[White frame, with some splatters of blood.]
<Bokusenou:    daga INUYASHA wa CHIGAu.>
Bokusenou: But Inuyasha is different.
<Bokusenou:    Oitsumerare, INOCHI ga KIKEN ni sarasareta TOKI,>
Bokusenou: When pressed, and his life is in danger,
<Bokusenou:    MI o MAMOru tame ni, YOUKAI no CHI ga KARADA o SHIHAIshi HENGEsuru-->
Bokusenou: to protect himself, his Youkai blood controls his body and transforms it...

2
[Closeup side view of Sesshoumaru pondering this, with a drawing of Inuyasha
looking menacing, the last time they fought.]
<Sesshoumaru:    sore ga... ano TOKI no...>
Sesshoumaru: .oO(That's... what happened then...).

3
[Closeup side view of Bokusenou's face.]
<Bokusenou:    daga na, INUYASHA ga oyaji-dono kara UkeTSUida DAI YOUKAI no CHI wa,>
Bokusenou: However, the blood of a Greater Youkai Inuyasha inherited from his oyaji-dono,
<Bokusenou:    HANYOU no MI ni wa TSUYOsugiru...>
Bokusenou: is too strong for a Half-Youkai's body...

4
[Closeup of Sesshoumaru looking a bit surprised.]
<Sesshoumaru:    ... suru to dou naru?>
Sesshoumaru: ... What happens then?

5
[Closeup of Bokusenou.]
<Bokusenou:    sou sa na...>
Bokusenou: Indeed...
<Bokusenou:    YOUKAI no CHI ni KOKORO o KUwareru to Itta tokoro ka.
** not quite sure how to do 'itta tokoro ka' = 'you could say'? 'maybe something like'?
>
Bokusenou: You could say his mind would be eaten away by the Youkai blood.



Page 11

[Side drawing of a very fierce looking Inuyasha, transformed.]
<Bokusenou:    JIBUN ga NANIMONO nano kamo wakaranu.>
Bokusenou: He wouldn't recognise anybody.
<Bokusenou:    TEKI mo MIKATA mo naku AITE o KOROsu.>
Bokusenou: He'd kill enemies and friends alike.
<Bokusenou:    soshite HENGE o KUriKAEsu uchi ni-->
Bokusenou: And after transforming repeatedly...

2
[Darkish frame.]
<Bokusenou:    izure INUYASHA no KOKORO wa KANZEN ni USHINAwareru.>
Bokusenou: eventually Inuyasha's mind will be lost completely.
<Bokusenou:    tada no TATAKAu dake no BAkeMONO ni nariHAte-->
Bokusenou: He'll be reduced to a monster that just fights...
<Bokusenou:    sono MI ga HORObiru made TATAKAi TSUZUkeru.>
Bokusenou: and will continue fighting until that body's destroyed.

3
[Closeup of Sesshoumaru.]
<Bokusenou:    onushi no oyaji-dono wa,>
Bokusenou: {off} Your oyaji-dono,
<Bokusenou:    INUYASHA ni sou natte hoshikunakatta no darou na.>
Bokusenou: didn't want that to happen to Inuyasha of course.
<Bokusenou:    dakara koso-->
Bokusenou: Which is precisely why...



Page 12

[White frame.]
<Bokusenou:    MAMOri GATANA to shite,>
Bokusenou: {off} as a sword of protection,
<Bokusenou:    INUYASHA ni TETSUSAIGA o ATAeta-->
