Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

drawing overview of Kohaku holding his sickle chain looking a bit uncertain.]

[Two page wide drawing of Inuyasha, Kagome and Miroku facing off with Kagura
and the hoard of Youkai.]
<Inuyasha:    ke_,>
Inuyasha: Bah,
<Inuyasha:    zuibun oogesa da na KAGURA.>
Inuyasha: how very grandiose Kagura.
Fx youkai: rustle... <Zawa...>

[Closeup of Inuyasha.]
<Inuyasha:    NIgeta Gaki hitori tsukamaeru no ni, TAIGUN HIkitsure yagatte.>
Inuyasha: You've brought along a fucking big group just to chase after an escaped brat.

[Inside the single room building nearby, Sango continues to hold-back Kohaku.]
<Kohaku:    ...KAKOmarete-ru.>
Kohaku: ...We're surrounded.
<Sango:    DAIJOUBU da KOHAKU.>
Sango: It's okay Kohaku.
<Sango:    SOTO ni DEru n-ja nai yo.>
Sango: Don't go outside.

2
[Closeup of Sango looking a bit worried.]
<Sango:    mou NIDO to omae o NARAKU no TE ni WATAshitari wa shinai.>
Sango: .oO(I won't let you fall into Naraku's hands again.).

[Back outside, a closeup of Kagura, with a slight smile, opening her fan.]
<Kagura:    fun,>
Kagura: Humph,
<Kagura:    koko de Atta ga HYAKUNENme da.>
Kagura: I'm glad to have met you here.
<Kagura:    tsuide ni temee-ra mo MINAGOROshi ni shite yaru yo.>
Kagura: I'm going to kill all you bastards while I'm at it.
Fx fan: fwap <Ba_>

2
[Closeup of Kagura making a move.]
<Kagura:    TOKU ni INUYASHA,>
Kagura: In particular Inuyasha,
<Kagura:    temee no KUBI wa kono atashi ga itadaku!>
Kagura: your head is mine!

3
[Kagura sends a cutting arc of wind towards Inuyasha who jumps out of the
way holding Kagome.]
<Kagura:    FUUJIN no MAI!>
Kagura: Fuujin no Mai! (Dance of the Wind-Blades)
Fx blade: swish <Sha_>
<Inuyasha:    ha_,>
Inuyasha: {dodging} Hah.
Fx ground: wham-am <Dogaga>

[A large group of Youkai stream towards the building.]
<Kagura:    KOHAKU o hikizuri DAse.>
Kagura: {off} Drag out Kohaku,
<Kagura:    ano DOU no NAKA da.>
Kagura: from that mini-temple.
Fx youkai: skrsh-skrsh <Zazaza>

(    Kagura calls the building a 'Dou', which my dictionary says is a (small)
temple or shrine. Looks kinda Buddhist style to me... The difference
between this and a more normal one is that they are not normally inhabited
and are (generally) only used by the monks/priests on special occations.)

2
[Hiraikotsu comes zooming out, knocking back the doors.]
Fx doors: wham <Bashi>
Fx Hiraikotsu: vish <Sha_>

Fx Sango: (boomerang) *catch* <Pashi>
Fx Kirara: whoosh <Go_>
<Sango:    omae-ra no AITE wa atashi da!>
Sango: Your opponent is me!

(    Sounds a bit wierd in english, but this is a somewhat common phrase used in
battles to 'claim' an opponnent. Sango is also basically saying that to
attack her before trying to attack anyone else.)

2
[Meanwhile Inuyasha is still dodging Kagura's blades while holding onto Kagome.]
Fx ground: wham <Doga_>
<Kagome:    INUYASHA hanashite.>
Kagome: Inuyasha, let me go.
<Inuyasha:    nanda to!?>
Inuyasha: You wanna what!?

[Closeup of Kagome.]
<Kagome:    atashi o kakaetecha TATAKAenai ja nai.>
Kagome: You can't fight while carrying me can you.

2
[Kagura prepares another volley.]
<Kagura:    fu_, SUki na you ni shi na, INUYASHA.>
Kagura: Heh, do as you wish, Inuyasha.
<Kagura:    ONNA goto matomete ano YO ni OKUtte yattemo ii-n da yo.>
Kagura: I may send you on to the next world together with that girl.
Fx blade: swish <Sha_>

[Inuyasha carries Kagome back towards the mini temple, while Miroku
dispatches some Youkai with his staff.]
<Inuyasha:    MIROKU,>
Inuyasha: Miroku,
<Inuyasha:    YOUKAI-domo o IPPO mo CHIKAzukeru na.>
Inuyasha: don't let any Youkai get even a step closer.

2
[Kohaku looks a bit confused/surprised.]
<Kohaku:    ha, hai.>
Kohaku: Y, yessir.

3
[Kohaku takes a sort of formal position, and Kagome and Inuyasha look a bit surprised.]
<Kohaku:    INOCHI ni kaetemo oMAMOri shimasu.>
Kohaku: I shall protect her with my life.
<Kagome:    KOHAKU-kun...>
Kagome: Kohaku-kun...

(    Kohaku is basically acting like he's a ninja/samurai making a vow to his
master ^-^)

Inuyasha: .oO(Got that!?).
Fx Inuyasha: swish <Za_>

6
[Kohaku looks off, and Kagome tries to re-assure him.]
<Kohaku:    ano HITO... ore no koto OKOtte-ru?>
Kohaku: Is that man... angry with me?
