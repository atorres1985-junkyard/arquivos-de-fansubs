Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

[Closeup of Kagome, looking a bit horrified.]
<Kagome:    wa... WARAtte-ru?>

<Kagome:    HITO o KOROshite...>
Kagome: .oO(About killing people...?).

[Shippou is now on Kagome's shoulder, having handed her Tetsusaiga.]
<Shippou:    kagome, INUYASHA ni TETSUSAIGA o WATAshite SHIZUmeru n-ja.>
Shippou: Kagome, hand Inuyasha Tetsusaiga to calm him down.
<Shippou:    ora, anna KAO no INUYASHA MItakunai.>
Shippou: I don't want to see Inuyasha looking like that.

<Kagome:    INUYASHA...>
Kagome: .oO(Inuyasha...).
<Kagome:    moto ni MODOtte.>
Kagome: .oO(return to normal.).

(    I suppose an obvious question is "why doesn't Kagome say 'sit!'". I think
this is because the last time Inuyasha did listen to Kagome, but this time
he's lost his mind so completely that he's completely forgotten about his.
In this state, 'sit' might not affect him, and may even make things worse...)
