Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

Fx liquid: hshht... <Shu-->
<Miroku:    ku_,>
Miroku: Ugh.

2
[The stuff has now completely wrapped around Miroku and Inuyasha, and they
can't be seen anymore. Ends of the mostly solidified liquid have tied
around two trees, and the main body of the 'cocoon' is suspended above the
ground in-between. Tetsusaiga is stuck into the ground near the cocoon.]

youkai: Kukuku... what's with you bastards.

3
[The boss looks at one bandit.]
<youkai:    ore ga YOUKAI to SHItte, OSOroshikunatta ka.>
youkai: Aren't you scared knowing that I'm a Youkai huh?
<bandit:    to, tondemonee.>

4
[View of some more of the bandits. They look a bit nervous.]
<bandit#1:    TSUYOi YOUKAI ga oKASHIRA nara, ore-tacha MUTEKI da.>

holding his staff out while holding Inuyasha (who looks a bit in a bad way)
between him.]

<youkai:    TOkete inai...!?>
youkai: .oO(They haven't dissolved...!?).

5
[Closeup of the Youkai.]
<youkai:    hoo... NAKA kara KEKKAI o HAtte iru no ka.>

4
[Inuyasha and Miroku, and the Youkai look at each other.]
<Inuyasha:    temee mitai na GESU YOUKAI ni, MOteru SHIROMONO ja nee tte koto da...>
Inuyasha: Meaning that for a low-life Youkai like you, it is no good for you...
<youkai:    hoo...>

5
[The boss turns to the bandit who brought him the sword.]
<youkai:    dewa kono GESU na NINGEN no YATOU wa, KATANA ni ERAbareta to iu koto ka?>

<Sango:    MURA de nanika atta n-da.>
Sango: Something happened in the village.
<Kagome:    DAIJOUBU!?>
