Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

[Closeup of a little hole in the ground, by a tree. (not sure if natural or
made by some animal.) Kohaku's head is visible looking out from inside it.]
<Kohaku:    mou YOUKAI wa Otte KOnai.>
Kohaku: The Youkai aren't following anymore.

3
[Closeup of the hole, with Kagome visible poking her head out a bit too.]

[Kagome looks up at Kohaku.]
<Kohaku:    ano ONNA no HITO...>
Kohaku: That girl...
<Kagome:    e...?>
Kagome: Eh...?

2
[Closeup side view of Kohaku, looking a bit worried.]
<Kohaku:    DAIJOUBU ka na.>
Kohaku: I wonder if she's okay.

3
[View of outside the hole looking in on Kagome talking to Kohaku.]
<Kagome:    a, aa, SANGO-chan sugoku TSUYOi no yo.>
Kagome: Ah, probably - Sango-chan is very strong.
<Kagome:    SHINPAInai wa.>
Kagome: Don't worry.

4
[Closeup of Kagome with a tend look.]
<Kagome:    nee KOHAKU-kun, mada OMOiDAsenai?>

[Scene change to Sango rushing along on Kirara, with Miroku and Sango
sitting behind her.]

[Closeup of Sango looking very tense.]
<Sango:    KOHAKU...>
Sango: .oO(Kohaku...).
<Sango:    moshi, omae ga atashi-tachi o damashite ita to shitara...>
Sango: .oO(Should it be that you have been deceiving us...).



Page 10

[White frame.]
<Sango:    soshite... moshimo kagome-chan o KIZUtsukeru you na koto o shitara...>
Sango: .oO(and... have actually gone as far as hurting Kagome-chan...).

[Closeup side view of Sango looking very tense.]
<Sango:    sono TOKI wa KOHAKU!>
Sango: .oO(then at that time Kohaku!).
<Sango:    omae wa atashi no TE de...>
Sango: .oO(By my own hand, I will...).

(    Sango obviously means she'll take direct action against Kohaku. The
implication is that she will even kill Kohaku if it comes down to it.
(Sounds pretty cruel I know... I guess that Sango thinks she might never
get the real Kohaku back from Naraku))

3
[Scene change - misty frame.]

4
[Closeup of Inuyasha looking a bit frustrated, and sweating a bit from exertion.]

<Inuyasha:    SAISHO kara NERAi wa kagome datta no ka...>
Inuyasha: Your target's been Kagome from the first huh...

3
[Closeup side view of Naraku.]

Page 13
1
[Closeup of Naraku.]
<Naraku:    KOHAKU JISHIN mo... JIBUN ga kisama-ra o AZAMUite iru koto o,>
Naraku: that's because even Kohaku himself... is _unaware_ of that fact that,
<Naraku:    SHIranai no dakara na.>
Naraku: he's deceiving you arseholes.

2
[Closeup side view of Inuyasha looking surprised.]

Inuyasha: Wha...
<Inuyasha:    dou iu koto da!?>

<Kohaku:    ore... ISSHO ni ite ii no ka na...?>
Kohaku: Is... it okay for me to be with her...?
<Kagome:    KImatte-ru ja nai.>
Kagome: Of course it is.

4
[View of the two from another angle.]
<Kagome:    sou sureba, IMA ni kitto SANGO-chan no koto mo OMOiDAseru wa.>
Kagome: If you do that, before long you'll surely start remembering about Sango-chan.
<Kohaku:    un...>

<Naraku:    KOHAKU wa naze KIOKU o nakushite iru to OMOu?>
Naraku: why do you think Kohaku has lost his memory?

5
[Closeup of Inuyasha.]
<Inuyasha:    temee ga KOKORO o AYATSUtte-ru kara darou ga.>
Inuyasha: Probably because you manipulated his mind.

6
[Closeup of Naraku.]
<Naraku:    kukuku... sou da.>
Naraku: Kukuku... Indeed.
<Naraku:    daga na...>
Naraku: However...

Inuyasha: That's...
<Inuyasha:    temee ga yaraseta n-darou ga!>

Naraku: Kukuku... he himself wants to forget.
<Naraku:    dakara, washi wa subete o WASUresasete yatta.>
Naraku: So, I made him forget everything.

5
[Inuyasha and Naraku look at each other.]
<Naraku:    soshite MASSHIRO ni natta KOHAKU no KOKORO o AYATSUru no wa,>
Naraku: So now that Kohaku's mind has become purely blank, manipulating him,
<Naraku:    itomo taYASUi koto.>
Naraku: is a trivial matter.

[Naraku raises a hand.]
<Naraku:    konna fuu ni na...>
