Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

Kikyou behind him.]
<Title:    NARAKU no SHOUTAI>
Title: The True Naraku

(    Hard to get exactly the right meaning here. Something like "the truth about
Naraku's appearance/body/shape" is a bit closer to the real meaning.)

[Closeup of Kagome looking down in fear.]
<Kagome:    KIKYOU...>
Kagome: .oO(Kikyou...).
<Kagome:    atashi o KOROsuKI!?>
Kagome: .oO(intends to kill me!?).

2
[A frozen moment in time, with Kagome nearly level with Kikyou up above the
fissure in the ground.]

3
[Kagome manages to grab onto the ledge of the fissure again, impacting painfully.]
Fx Kagome: thud <Dan>



Page 3
1
[Kagome is once again hanging on to the ledge with just her hands, looking
up angrily.]
Fx Kikyou: (walking forwards) shh... <Za...>

2
[Closeup of Kikyou.]
<Kikyou:    omae wa WATASHI da...>
Kikyou: You are me...
<Kikyou:    kono YO ni Aru no wa hitori dake de ii...>
Kikyou: It's better that there be only one in this world...

3
[Closeup of Kagome, with a surprised look.]

4
[View of some trees.]
Fx sound: {off} shh <Za_>
<Inuyasha:    kagome!>
Inuyasha: {off} Kagome!



Page 4

[Inuyasha is standing on the other side of the fissure, looking surprised.]
Fx Inuyasha: shh <Za_>
Inuyasha: !

2
[View of the other two, from Inuyasha's point of view, with Kagome turning
around to look.]
Fx Kikyou: (taking a step back) *walk...* <Zaku...>

3
[Closeup of Kagome.]
<Kagome:    i...>
Kagome: I...
<Kagome:    INUYASHA!>
Kagome: Inuyasha!

4
[Inuyasha rushes forwards.]
<Inuyasha:    kagome!>
Inuyasha: Kagome!
Fx Inuyasha: *jump* <Da_>

5
[Kikyou has a slightly annoyed look.]
Kikyou: ......



Page 5
1
[Inuyasha lands on Kagome's side of the ledge, just next to her.]
Fx Inuyasha: vish <Zan>

2
[Inuyasha grabs Kagome's arm.]
Fx Inuyasha: *yank* <Gu_>

3
[Closeup of Inuyasha, looking worried.]
<Inuyasha:    DAIJOUBU ka!?>
Inuyasha: Are you okay!?
<Inuyasha:    ittai nani ga...>
Inuyasha: .oO(What in the world is...).

4
[Closeup of Kagome looking relieved, but still shocked.]
<Kagome:    ki... KIKYOU ga...>
Kagome: Ki... Kikyou was...
<Kagome:    atashi o...>
Kagome: [trying to kill] me...

(    In Japanese, the verb comes later, and since Kagome doesn't complete her
sentance with a verb phrase, she doesn't specify _what_ Kikyou was doing,
or trying to do, to Kagome. Hence the square-brackets around "trying to
kill" to indicate that I added something to make the sentance grammatically
correct in english, when it wasn't explicity said in the Japanese. It seems
that Inuyasha didn't see what happened just before he arrived - he was
moving pretty quick.)

5
[Inuyasha turns to look off at Kikyou, and Kagome is hanging onto Inuyasha.]
<Inuyasha:    na_...>
Inuyasha: Wha...

6
[View of Kikyou, with a slightly defensive stance, with a glow coming from
her hand - the Shikon fragment.]
<Kikyou:    SHIKON no kakera o moratta dake da.>
Kikyou: I just took the Shikon fragment.

[View of the fissure behind Inuyasha, with the miasma at the bottom.
Inuyasha looks down into hit, still holding Kagome, who is sitting on the ground.]
<Kikyou:    osoraku NARAKU wa kagome no KARADA o TOkashi...>
Kikyou: {off} Presumably Naraku intended to dissolve Kagome's body...
Inuyasha: !
<Kikyou:    NOKOtta SHIKON no kakera o toru tsumori datta no darou.>
Kikyou: {off} and get hold of the Shikon fragment.
Fx miasma: glub... <Gobo...>

[Closeup of Kagome looking quite sad.]
Kagome: ......
<Kagome:    dakara... SHIKON no kakera o torarete...
** dakara => "what happened was that"...?
>
Kagome: The... Shikon fragment was taken...

4
[Inuyasha speaks to Kagome a bit angrily, and she's still looking down at
the ground, away from him.]
<Kagome:    gomen.>
Kagome: I'm sorry.
<Inuyasha:    sonna koto KIite-ru n-ja nee_.>
Inuyasha: I'm not asking about that!

5
[Closeup of Inuyasha.]
<Inuyasha:    KIKYOU wa masaka...>
Inuyasha: Don't tell me that Kikyou was...
<Inuyasha:    omae made...>

<Kagome:    TSUgeGUCHIsuru mitai de...
** is this more "tell truth when shouldn't/bad for others" or "making tales up"?
>
Kagome: .oO(It'd seem like I was making it up...).
<Kagome:    INUYASHA...>
Kagome: Inuyasha...

<Kagome:    nani asette n-no yo.>

[Inuyasha takes hold of Kagome's hand.]
Fx Inuyasha: (Kagome's hand) *grip* <Gyu_>
Kagome: !

3
[Inuyasha holds up Kagome's hand in his own. Kagome has a gently surprised look.]
<Inuyasha:    to, tonikaku...>
Inuyasha: A, anyway...
<Inuyasha:    mou chito ore o SHIYOUshite...>
Inuyasha: Have a bit more confidence in me...

4
[Closeup of Kagome.]
<Kagome:    INUYASHA...>
Kagome: Inuyasha...

5
[View of Miroku, who is carrying Sango, who looks unconscious, on his back,
with her boomerand, and Shippou, who looks unconscious too.]
Fx Miroku: (comically) *in tatters...* <boro...>
Miroku: ......

6
[Miroku is looking on from the other side of the fissure. Inuyasha and
Kagome look at him in comical anger/surprise.]
<Miroku:    ...oHANASHI wa oSUmi de?>
Miroku: ...Have you finished your conversation?
<Inuyasha and Kagome:    e".>
Inuyasha and Kagome: _Eh_.

(    The joke with the FX in the 5th frame is that Miroku (and the others) are
in a wreck, but Kagome and Inuyasha are having an 'interesting' scene...)



Page 11

<Kikyou:    omae no KOSOKU na JUTSU nazo,>
Kikyou: Your little makeshift spell,
<Kikyou:    kono WATASHI ni wa TSUUYOUshinai.>
Kikyou: has no effect on me.

4
[Kikyou holds up the glowing Shikon fragment.]
<Kikyou:    INUYASHA-tachi ga CHIKAzukenuyou, kono SHIRO o OOtte iru KEKKAI mo--->
Kikyou: The warding you have to conceal this castle so that Inuyasha and the others can't get close...

[Closeup of Kikyou.]
<Kikyou:    dakara koso omae wa SHIKON no TAMA o HOSshite iru.>
Kikyou: Which is exactly why you want the Shikon no Tama.
<Kikyou:    KANZEN na YOUKAI no KARADA o Eru tame ni...>
Kikyou: To gain a completely Youkai body...

2
[Closeup of Naraku, looking annoyed.]

Naraku: why hand me the Shikon fragment...?

4
[View of some walls.]
<Naraku:    kono NARAKU wa, GOJUU NEN MAE kisama o SHI ni Oiyatta NIKUi KATAKI...>

[Closeup of Kikyou, with a smirk.]
<Kikyou:    fu_...>

[Closeup of Naraku.]
<Naraku:    dakara... URAnde inai to demo Iu no ka?>
Naraku: .oO(Are you saying... that is why you don't hate me?).

(    Kikyou is certainly lying or being deceptive to Inuyasha or Naraku, or
both. The first and second time she turned up (when she angrily tried to
kill Inuyasha, and when she kissed Inuyasha) she certainly seemed to have
some feelings of love and hate around...)

4

Kikyou: I will return back to that temple.
<Kikyou:    NIge mo KAKUre mo shinai.>

[View of Naraku, bare to the waist, looking back over his shoulder. Covering
his back is a spider-shaped burn mark.]
<Naraku:    NANDO KARADA o tori kaetemo...>
Naraku: .oO(No matter how often I've changed bodies...).
<Naraku:    YATOU ONIGUMO no YAKEDO no ATO ga... SENAKA no KUMO ga KIenu...>
Naraku: .oO(wild-thief Onigumo's burn mark... won't disappear from my back... ).

[Closeup side view of Naraku.]
<Naraku:    KIKYOU...>

Page 18

[View of the large Shikon fragment.]
<Naraku:    wakaran.>
Naraku: .oO(I don't understand you.).
<Naraku:    KIKYOU wa ittai nani o KANGAete iru?>
Naraku: .oO(What on earth is Kikyou thinking?).

2
[Kikyou is outside the castle, looking back.]
Fx Kikyou: shh... <Za...>
<Kikyou:    NARAKU yo... SHIKON no kakera o ATSUmeru ga ii.>
Kikyou: .oO(Naraku... go ahead and collect the Shikon fragments.).

3
[View of Kikyou with a serious and determined look.]
<Kikyou:    soshite KANPEKI na SHIKON no TAMA o TE ni shita TOKI...>
Kikyou: .oO(Then, when you have the complete Shikon no Tama in your hands...).
<Kikyou:    kono WATASHI ga kisama o JIGOKU ni OKUru.>
Kikyou: .oO(I will send you to hell.).

(    Some translation notes. 14 times so far, Naraku has used "kono Naraku" (ie
"I, Naraku...") when speaking/thinking. It's hard to explain, but this
gives a sense that the speaker (Naraku, in this case) is impressed with
themselves - ie a sense of vainity. Similarly Kikyou has said "kono
watashi" five times. Inuyasha has used "kono ore" three times, though of
course has had far more 'screen time' than Naraku and Kikyou. Sesshoumaru
has said "kono Sesshoumaru/watashi" 4 times. Side note, 'watashi' is a
slightly formal way of saying 'I' - Miroku and Kikyou tend to use it a lot,
while 'ore' is a strongly masculine way of saying 'I'. Kagome, and just
about everyone else, have never used this style of speech.<br>
Naraku also says 'kisama' a lot ('kisama' being the most insulting general
purpose word for 'you'), as does Sesshoumaru. In the way they use it, the
tone is perhaps more like 'you pathetic worm', rather than 'you arsehole' -
ie they totally look down on everyone. Kikyou uses 'kisama' when referring
to Naraku, above. Inuyasha has never used 'kisama', though Sango has (when
facing Inuyasha, thinking he'd attacked her village, and against Naraku)
though the tone/sense is somewhat different - hating or detesting someone.)

old man: you ain't trying to trick me, are you Myouga?

2
[A silloutte of a hunched man with some kind of staff or pole is sitting on
what looks to be an ox, with the full moon in the background.]
<old man:    HONTOU ni sono nantara iu yatsu ga, TETSUSAIGA o TSUKAi konashita no ka-?>
old man: Can this whatever-you-called-him guy, really use Tetsusaiga very well?
<Myouga:    INUYASHA-sama ja_.>
Myouga: It's Inuyasha-sama!

3
[View of the man on the ox (though it has 3 eyes), who is quite thin and
wrinkled. He has a little bunch of white hair, tied up at the back, and a
white strangly beard. He also has large round eyes, and pointed ears - ie a
very old Youkai.]
<old man:    INUYASHA...>
old man: Inuyasha...
<old man:    KATANA ni TSUKAu KIBA o kudasareta, INU no TAISHOU no MUSUKO...
** not sure what effect 'kudasareta' (ie 'kureta') has here

old man: The stupid younger brother, huh.
Fx old man: (head) skritch skritch <puori puori>

(    The old man refers to Inuyasha's father as "inu no taishou", meaning
"general/boss/leader of the dogs".)

Myouga: [Only once when Inuyasha] with just one swing, mowed down a hundred Youkai.

2
[Closeup of Myouga, sighing to himself.]
<Myouga:    mottomo sono ATO wa Sappari de no.>
Myouga: Since then there's been nothing.
<Myouga:    mo~~~ osoba ni iru to ABUnoute ABUnoute...>
Myouga: She~e~e~sh Being next to him has been danger and more danger...
Fx Myouga: *si-i-i-gh...* <fu--...>

<old man:    ma- TAMEsasete morau ka no.>
old man: Well, I guess I'll test him out.
<old man:    sono INUYASHA ga...>

[Continuation of above frame, with a side view of the old man.]

old man: Let's see if he is appropiate to have the famous blade Tetsusaiga, which I forged...
