Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

side of which, several shadows of the Youkai-insects can be seen.]

[Closeup of Kikyou, eyes open, but she doesn't have much expression.]
Fx barrier: (off) bzzt... bzzt <Bachi... Bachi_>

2
[View of Kikyou from above.]
<Naraku:    SHINIDAMA ga nakereba, KARADA o UGOkesenu you da na.>
Naraku: {off} Looks like without the Dead-souls, you can't move.

3
[Closeup of Naraku walking in with a slight smile.]
<Naraku:    KEKKAI o hatte aru.>
Naraku: I've erected a barrier.
<Naraku:    ano MUSHI-domo wa haitte KOrenu.>

[Closeup side view of Naraku, looking down at Kikyou.]
<Naraku:    KONDO wa NIgeraren zo.>
Naraku: This time you can't escape.
<Naraku:    KIKYOU...>
Naraku: Kikyou...

2
[Closeup of Kikyou, looking slightly sad.]
Kikyou: ......

3
[Naraku is now sitting next to Kikyou.]
<Naraku:    KIKYOU, kisama...>
Naraku: Kikyou you scum...
<Naraku:    nani o KANGAete iru...>
Naraku: just what were you thinking...

4
[Drawing of back when Kikyou's arrow broke the seal and blew up the top of
the mountain.]
<Naraku:    kisama no YA wa yasuyasu to waga FUUIN o uchiYABUtta.>
Naraku: {voice over} Your arrow broke my seal very easily.

5
[Drawing of when Inuyasha was close to killing the large Youkai.]
<Naraku:    INUYASHA no MI o, YOUKAI to no YUUGOU kara SUKUitakatta no nara...>
Naraku: {voice over} If you wanted to save Inuyasha's body from fusing with the Youkai, then...



Page 5
1
[Drawing of the large Youkai being blown apart in a bright flash.]
<Naraku:    kisama no YA de YOUKAI no KARADA o INUkeba yokatta no da.>
Naraku: {voice over} it would have been better to shoot your arrow through the Youkai's body.

2
[Closeup of Naraku.]
<Naraku:    sou sureba, YOUKAI wa hitotamari mo naku KEshiTOnde ita hazu.>
Naraku: If you'd done that, the Youkai would surely have been blown away easily.

(    It's still not clear just how Kikyou managed to get the power to do what
she did, since she couldn't even move, just before, and now. It seems most
likely that Kagome (or the Shikon fragment, or both) simply being near made
the difference. It's also probably because of her powers that Kagome wasn't
affected by the evil in the air, unlike the other humans. It's never been
explained how Inuyasha managed to break the sealing spell Kikyou put on him
(at the end of chapter 1), and perhaps Kagome (and her strong spiritual
power) being near to him earlier was enough to weaken the spell.)

Naraku: That Onigumo, he freely submitted his own body to the Youkai...
<Naraku:    KUiTSUkusareta.>
Naraku: and was eaten up.

[Closeup sinister view of Naraku.]
<Naraku:    ONIGUMO no YOROSHIMA na TAMASHII o tsunagi ni shite, YOriATSUmatta YOUKAI ga hitotsu ni nari...>

<Miroku:    haa.>
Miroku: Indeed.

<Kagome:    INUYASHA...>
Kagome: Inuyasha...

5
[Kagome is looking at Inuyasha who is sitting on the ground with his back to her.]

Kagome: It's because Kikyou saved you...
<Kagome:    sorede CHIKARA TSUkite, NARAKU ni sarawareta n-desho.>
Kagome: and she exhausted her power, that Naraku got hold of her.

[Kagome continues to talk to Inuyasha forcefully.]
<Kagome:    TASUke ni Iku no AtariMAE ja nai.>
Kagome: Of course we have to save her.

>
Kagome: Don't be so sneaky!
<Inuyasha:    kosokoso tte ano na_...>
Inuyasha: "Sneaky?", now just a minute...

[Closeup of Sango and Kagome - Sango is looking back at Kagome who is
peeking over her shoulder. (cute!)]
<Sango:    ...kagome-chan, itsumo mitai ni INUYASHA ni NOreba i- no ni.

Fx Kagome: *si~i~i~i~gh* <ha~~~>
Sango: ......

(    It's hard to say exactly what Kagome means, though it seems that what she
really doesn't like is Inuyasha only thinking about Kikyou. When she says
"Inuyasha's head is full with thoughts of Kikyou", she says it in a
slightly sulky way.)

[The glowing arrow speeds towards Inuyasha, with a drawing of Kikyou (blood
running down the side of her face, just like in chapter 1) overlaid. Side
note - Inuyasha still has Tetsusaiga at his side, and the rosary around his neck.]
