Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

<Title:    MIenai KIDOU>
Title: Unseeable Method

(    Another tricky title. In this case, "method" is something like "way of
swinging [a sword]", and the title refers specifically to the way
Tetsusaiga must be swung in order to use it's true power.)
