Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

Naraku: ...So, this woman broke the seal from inside.

2
[Closeup of Kikyou.]

[Back to Naraku, who is putting on that baboon pelt he always has.]
<Naraku:    tsumari kono ONNA no okage de,>
Naraku: Meaning that it's thanks to this woman,
<Naraku:    kono NARAKU wa, ATARAshii KARADA o BUJI TE ni Ireta to iu koto ni naru.>
Naraku: that I, Naraku, can safely get my hands on a new body.

4
[Inuyasha looks really angry.]
<Inuyasha:    na_...>
Inuyasha: Wha...

5
[Kagome suddenly comes out from behind Inuyasha.]
<Kagome:    CHIGAu wa yo Baka!>
Kagome: You're wrong you idiot!
<Kagome:    ano TOKI KIKYOU ga YA o HANAtanakattara...>
Kagome: Because if Kikyou hadn't fired that arrow then...

6
[Drawing of back when Inuyasha was slicing through the large Youkai with Tetsusaiga.]
<Kagome:    INUYASHA wa YOUKAI o KOROshite shimatte...>
Kagome: Inuyasha would have gone and killed the Youkai...
<Kagome:    KARADA ga YUUGOUshite shimau tokoro datta kara...>
Kagome: and their bodies would have then fused...



Page 15
1
[Closeup of Kagome speaking forcefully.]

2
[Closeup of Naraku.]
<Kagome:    INUYASHA o MAMOru tame ni...>
Kagome: did it to protect Inuyasha...

3
[Naraku has now picked up Kikyou.]
<Naraku:    ...dou yara kono ONNA, HONTOU ni...>

<Naraku:    GOJUU NEN MAE ni INUYASHA...>
Naraku: the Kikyou who died following...
<Naraku:    kisama no ato o Otte SHInda KIKYOU rashii na...>
Naraku: Inuyasha 50 years ago...
Fx Naraku: (Kikyou) *tug* <Gui>

(    Perhaps Inuyasha did not move to protect Kikyou earlier so that he could
protect Kagome - it would have been hard to protect both. Also, this Naraku
'puppet' here, speaks like he really is Naraku. Also, a reminder that
Naraku has some Shikon fragments on him - this is probably how he
transformed the Youkai. And finally, Kagome does has some arrows with her,
but no bow.)

[Inuyasha looks angry and frustrated.]
<Inuyasha:    ku_...>

out from him.]

<Naraku:    kisama nanzo ni WATAsu no wa Oshii...>
Naraku: You couldn't get Kikyou's powers for yourself...
<Inuyasha:    ku_,>
Inuyasha: Ugh!
