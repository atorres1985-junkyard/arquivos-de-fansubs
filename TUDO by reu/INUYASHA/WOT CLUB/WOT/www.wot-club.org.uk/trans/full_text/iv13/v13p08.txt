Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

[Sesshoumaru stands holding up a relatively plain looking sword, with a
slightly annoyed look. The sword is presumably the one that he carries at
his side, since the scabbard is empty.]
<Title:    TENSEIGA>
Title: Tenseiga

(    Tetsusaiga is "Iron Pulverising Fang" (or 'tusk' instead of 'fang'), and
Tenseiga is tensei-fang - the 'ga' at the end is 'fang'. With the same
kanji spelling, in two of my dictionaries 'tensei' can be translated as
"natural", "vocation", "one's calling", though I don't think this is
appropiate. A kanji by kanji reading would be "Heavenly Life Fang", or
"Sacred Life Fang" - perhaps "Life is Sacred Fang"...)

** If it was "Tetsusaiga ni", I think my translation would be fine,

>
Sesshoumaru: Don't you think it's a pity for Tetsusaiga?
<Sesshoumaru:    kono INUYASHA wa CHIKARA makaseni KATANA o FUriMAWAsu dake...>
Sesshoumaru: All Inuyasha can do is wave about a sword with all his strength...
<Sesshoumaru:    kore de wa MEITOU mo MARUTA to ONAji da.>
Sesshoumaru: It's the same whether it's a famous sword, or a log.

** is this more like "so you permanently refuse me"?
>
Sesshoumaru: Still stubbornly refusing I, Sesshoumaru, huh.

4
[Toutousai angrily speaks off at Sesshoumaru, pointing a finger, and his
words surprise Sesshoumaru.]
<Toutousai:    yakamashii wa!>
Toutousai: Shut up!
<Toutousai:    daitai kisama ni wa, sude ni RIPPA na KATANA o HITOFURI ATAete aru dewa nai ka__!
** 'hitofuri' (one what?) doesn't seem to make much sense here.
>
Toutousai: In the first place, you already have been given a wonderful sword, haven't you!!
Inuyasha: !?

[Closeup of Toutousai.]
<Toutousai:    kisama no KOSHI no TENSEIGA!>

<Toutousai:    TETSUSAIGA ni MASAru tomo OTOranu MEITOU de aru zo!!>
Toutousai: It's a renouned blade that neither surpasses nor is inferior to Tetsusaiga!

<Toutousai:    kore wa oyaji-dono no YUIGON demo aru!>

Kagome: Sesshoumaru's sword was also made by ojii-san...
<Miroku:    shikashi NUita no o MIta koto ga ari masen na.>

[Closeup of Sesshoumaru looking angry.]
<Sesshoumaru:    hozake TOUTOUSAI.>
Sesshoumaru: Fuck you Toutousai.
Fx Sesshoumaru: *stir of power...* <Zawa...>
<Sesshoumaru:    kono namakura-GATANA ga SESSHOUMARU ni fusawashii to nukasu ka.
** nukasu doesn't make much sense here.
** I can't find it in my dictionaries, but I think this might be a "don't make fun of me" type thing. (I think I've heard it in anime)
>
Sesshoumaru: This blunt sword is not in anyway suitable for I, Sesshoumaru.

[Toutousai is on the back of that ox, flying through the sky, with Inuyasha
and Kagome behind him. Nearby Miroku, Shippou and Sango are on Kirara.]

Kagome: _Amazing_, ojii-san.
<Kagome:    TSUYOi n-ja nai?
** hmm? "strong enough to fight Sesshoumaru"?
>
Kagome: Quite powerful, aren't you?
<Miroku:    mattaku...>

[Miroku looks over at Inuyasha, who looks like an angry child.]

Toutousai: And Sesshoumaru called the blade I made for Sesshoumaru blunt...

[Jaken is looking up at Sesshoumaru who is sitting on a rock. That
two-headed lizard from the previous chapter is nearby.]

<Jaken:    sono oKOSHI no KATANA ga CHICHI-GIMI no KATAMI to wa.>
Jaken: That the sword at your side is a momento of your chichi-gimi.

Jaken: What in the world kind of devil-blade is it?

<Sesshoumaru:    KOROsenu KATANA na no da.>

<Inuyasha:    sorede douyatte TATAKAu n-da?>
Inuyasha: How're you supposed to fight with that?

[The group is by a river, and is breathing some flames onto a fire, over
which is small boar is hanging.]

2
[View of Miroku and Sango.]
<Toutousai:    TSUYOki mono o NAgiHARAu TETSUSAIGA ni TAIshite,>

<Toutousai:    TENSEIGA wa, YOWAki mono no INOCHI o tsunagu KATANA.>
Toutousai: Tenseiga, is a sword that links life for the weak.
<Sango:    INOCHI o tsunagu...?>

3
[Sango comes to talk to the old man.]
<Sango:    tte, maska IkiKAEraseru tte koto?>
Sango: Just a sec, you don't mean it can restore someone to life?
<Toutousai:    TSUKAi konaseba na.>
Toutousai: If you master it.

(    Perhaps Sango is thinking of Kohaku...)

4
[View of Inuyasha and Kagome.]

Toutousai: with one swing Tenseiga has the ability to save even 100 lives with one swing.

[Closeup of Inuyasha with a flat look.]
<Inuyasha:    naruhodo na.>
Inuyasha: I get it.
<Inuyasha:    SESSHOUMARU no YAROU ga, ATARAhii KATANA HOshigaru wake da ze.>
Inuyasha: So that's why that jerk Sesshoumaru's been longing for a new sword.

2
[Inuyasha looks a bit annoyed, and Toutousai is thinking.]
<Inuyasha:    sonna oTASUke-GATANA,>
Inuyasha: Such a helpful sword,
<Inuyasha:    SESSHOUMARU nya SAKADAchi shita tte TSUKAeru wake nee.>
Inuyasha: would oppose Sesshoumaru, and there's no way he could use it.
<Toutousai:    yappa Dame ka naa.>
Toutousai: Maybe [giving Tenseiga to Sesshoumaru] was no good after all.

3
[View of Miroku and Kagome.]
<Miroku:    ano ANI-UE no SEIKAKU dewa naa.>
Miroku: Not with the personality that elder brother has.
<Kagome:    TSUKAetemo UREshikunai desho- shi nee.>
Kagome: He wouldn't be pleased to be able to use it either.

[View of the roof of a run-down temple.]

Page 18
1
[Sesshoumaru is sitting by a doorway, blood dripping from his right hand.]
<Jaken:    SESSHOUMARU-sama o OSOu nado HYAKUNEN HAYAi wa.>
Jaken: They're 100 years too early to even try to attack Sesshoumaru-sama.
Sesshoumaru: ......

(    A stock phrase in Japanese is to say someone is a certain number of years
to early to attack (though can refer to other, similar things) someone
else. The number of years isn't really relevant to the people's ages,
really, though it is quite probable that Sesshoumaru is over 100 years old.
It's like saying "even if you trained and practiced for 100 years, you
might be able to fight evenly with me".)

2
[Black frame.]
<Sesshoumaru:    ano Oibore...>
Sesshoumaru: .oO(That old fart...).
<Sesshoumaru:    KATANA o Utanu nara mou YOU wa nai.>
Sesshoumaru: .oO(If he won't make a blade there's nothing else.).

3
[Sesshoumaru holds up a blood-smeared hand.]
<Sesshoumaru:    INUYASHA tomo domo...>
Sesshoumaru: .oO(I shall send Inuyasha and the rest...).
<Sesshoumaru:    ano YO ni OKUtte yaru.>
Sesshoumaru: .oO(to the next life.).

(    ie, he intends to kill them all.)
