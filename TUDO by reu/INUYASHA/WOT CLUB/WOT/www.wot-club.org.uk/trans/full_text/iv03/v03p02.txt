Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

Title: The Tsukumo Toad


(    'Tsukumo' is an old word for 99, but it is also used in place and family
names, which may be the intended meaning in this case.)

Nobunaga: .oO(This is the castle which is being occupied by an evil spirit.).

(    _Tono_ is a term of address for a fuedal lord. I've decided to keep the
word as 'tono' as translating it into 'lord' makes the English sound rather strange.)

Tsuyuhime: you are a kind-hearted childhood friend.

(    Usually, _osana-najimi_ (childhood friends) are limited to only a few

Kagome: Oh, you look better now.


(    Kagome's remark above is for comic effect and would literally translate as
"He's gotten well (or vigorous) again" (due to his anger overcoming his
pain), and it also seems like Kagome wasn't worried about him at all.)
