Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

holding the bottle with the Shikon no Tama fragments, and smiling, while

Title: Phantom Fire

(    The title is 'kitsune-bi', and a 'kitsune' is a magical 'fox' from Japanese
folklore, and 'bi' is for fire.)

Kagome: Hooray for you...

3
[The view pans out, and Kagome and Inuyasha are sitting next to an ancient
battle field at dawn, where skeletons and various leftovers from the battle
are scattered around. Between them is a small stove with a boiling kettle,
and behind Kagome is her rucksack and bike.]
Fx wind: who-o-sh <hyu---->
Fx Inuyasha: *slurping noodles* <zubibi>
Fx crows: _caw caw caw caw_ <Ga- Ga- Ge- Ge->
<Inuyasha:    KUwanee no ka.>

[Suddenly the scene darkens, surprising the pair.]
Fx sound: whooshh... <Goooo...>
<Kagome:    n!?>

spindly arms and legs.]
Fx youkai: (appearing) kapon <po-n>
<youkai:    yokose~~~>
youkai: Give it to me~~~~

(    The sound effect for the Youkai appearing is 'pon', and this use was
actually invented by Rumiko Takahashi, and it also has a slightly humorous slant.)

2
[The trio look somewhat surprised.]

[Inuyasha (who doesn't look amused) and Kagome stand in front of the

[Inuyasha finds his right hand pinned to the ground by a silly looking monk
statue, and Kagome looks over his shoulder in surprise.]

Shippou: My name's Shippou.
<Kagome:    nande SHIKON no TAMA NERAtta no yo.>
Kagome: Why were you going for the Shikon no Tama?

(    As a word, 'shippou' refers to the 7 treasures (gold, silver, pearls,
agate, crystal, coral,lapis lazuli), though it is also a personal name.
Happosai (from Ranma 1/2), means "8 treasures alike", and also 'shippo' is
a word for 'tail', which is what Inuyasha says on page 6.)



Page 9

[Closeup side view of Shippou.]
<Shippou:    otou no KATAKI o Uchi-takatta n-ja.>
Shippou: I wanted vengeance on Otou's enemy.

(    'Otou' is 'father' without any suffix, like '-chan', '-san', '-sama'.)

Kagome: "Enemy"...
<Kagome:    otou-san KOROsare chatta no...>

5
[Shippou talks angrily to himself.]

Shippou: Even without borrowing such power, I am strong.
<Shippou:    tada...>
Shippou: However...

[Riding on a black cloud-like thing is a vaguely humanoid Youkai with
another in front floating above two wheels (floating in the air, with
spectral flames coming from the axles) is another Youkai, both in rich and
complex armour, and the front-most one carries a long spear and is a
humanoid with a very long braided pony-tail, slit-iris eyes, pointed ears
and has three fragments in his forehead, and is smiling happily. The other
one is a fairly plump, has a head something like a scaleless lizard, with
pointed ears, a wide toothy mouth, three hairs on the top of his head and
two fragments in his forehead.]
Fx air: *rush---* <Go---->
<Hiten:    KAru zo MANTEN!>
Hiten: (the humanish one) Let's hunt, Manten!
<Manten:    aiyo~ HITEN an-chan.>
Manten: Sure, Hiten-an-chan.

(    "Manten" means "star studded"/"filled with stars", and Hiten is a name, and
could be translated something like "flying the sky/heavens". "An-chan" is
probably provincial speech, and is used to refer to one's elder brother.)



Page 12
1
[While they fly above the soldiers, Hiten slices off heads, arms and cuts
bodies in two swinging his spear back and forth while Manten claps happily.]
Fx Hiten: (chopping up soldiers) *wham wham wham* <Dogaga>
Fx Hiten: *sharp cutting swing* <Gyan>
<Hiten:    a-hahahahahaha!>

horses, and all look shocked.]

Fx Manten: (eating arm) *gnaw* <gari>
<Hiten:    a- omoshirokatta naa Manten.>
Hiten: Ahh Wasn't that fun, Manten.
<Manten:    da yo ne- Hiten-an-chan.>

4
[Closeup of Hiten pointing to the glowing Shikon no Tama fragments on his forehead.]
<Hiten:    nanka CHIKARA ga AMAtte sho-ga nee ya.>
Hiten: Can't help this power over-flow somehow.
<Hiten:    yappari kono HITAI ni SHIKOnda SHIKON no kakera no sei ka na.
                        f-head   embeded
**
>
Hiten: I wonder if it's because of these Shikon fragments embedded on my forehead after all.



Page 15

[As they continue to fly through the air, Hiten turns to Manten who has just
finished off his snack.]
Fx Manten: *munch munch* <pori pori>
<Hiten:    motto motto ATSUmeyou ze MANTEN.>
Hiten: Let's collect even more, Manten!
<Manten:    un,>
Manten: Yeah,
<Manten:    konida no BAke GITSUNE mitai ni bu_KOROshichao-.>
Manten: Let's waste more, like we did to that magical Kitsune the other day.

[Closeup of Kagome, looking a little surprised.]
<Kagome:    e_,>

<Kagome:    SHIKON no kakera MOtteta no!?>

Myouga: I heard they're hopelessly violent siblings but...

7
[Closeup of Inuyasha looking amused.]
<Inuyasha:    nanni shitemo soitsura o TAOseba,
              no matter what the curcumstances are
>
Inuyasha: No matter what they are, it means that if we destroy them,
<Inuyasha:    ippen ni   NANKO mo      SHIKON no kakera o toreru tte wake ka.
              ichido ni? several more
>
Inuyasha: we can get several more Shikon fragments all at once, doesn't it.

<Shippou:    ora-tachi YOUKAI no Kenka ni shashariDEte kun ja nee.
                                 fight    meddle       konai
>
Shippou: don't try to butt in on a fight between us Youkai.

5
[Closeup of Kagome looking unhappy with Shippou's statement.]
<Kagome:    SHIPPOU-chan, sou iu Ii KATA wa...>
Kagome: Shippou-chan, that's not a nice thing to say...

[Inuyasha feels less restrained and whacks Shippou on the head.]

>
Shippou: Unless that seal is removed, the Jizou statue won't move.
<Inuyasha:    temee_.>
Inuyasha: You git!

(     Jizou originates from the ancient Indian Buddhism. Jizou protects the
people while Buddha is not on the earth (he died several thousands years
ago, and is supposed to resurrect after tens of thousands of years - Jizou
is a deputy of Buddha for the time being.)

>
Shippou: I don't want to commit violent acts to a lass, but...

(    'Lass' was translated from 'onago' which is an old world for girl, though
it can be used to refer to woman in general up to middle-aged.)

Fx Shippou: *poke* <dosu_>
<Shippou:    omae mo shibaraku NEMUtte ite morau_.>
