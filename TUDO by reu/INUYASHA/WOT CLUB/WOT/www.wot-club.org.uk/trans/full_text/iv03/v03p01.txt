Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

[Overlaid over the rest of the frame, is Inuyasha talking down to some _kappas_.]
<Inuyasha:    dakara SHIKON no TAMA no Kakera da yo.>
Inuyasha: So I'm asking about a Shikon no Tama fragment...
<Inuyasha:    SHIranee ka?>
Inuyasha: Don't you know of any?

2
[Closeup of two _kappas_ sitting in the water. ]
<kappa1:    SHIKON no TAMA iu tara.>
kappa1: Speaking of the Shikon no Tama.
<kappa2:    TE ni Iretara    YOURIKI ga TAKAmaru iu UWASA no.
            hand  insteat-if sp power   rise        rumour
>
kappa2: It's rumoured that it increases your spiritual power, if you get it.

3
[Crouching on a tree trunk leaning over a pond, Inuyasha talks down to some kappas.]
<Inuyasha:    SHItte n-no ka?>
Inuyasha: You know of it?
<kappa1:    SHItteru ka yate.
           =shitte iruka datte
>
kappa1: He's asking if you know of it.
<kappa2:    nani o?>
kappa2: About what?

(    These kappas happen to be speaking in the Kansai dialect, even though
they're nowhere near the place. Maybe they left Kansai for some reason.)

4
[Two kappas talk to each other.]
<kappa1:    SHIKON no TAMA.>
kappa1: The Shikon no Tama.
<kappa2:    a---- YOURIKI ga TAKAmaru iu UWASA no na.>
kappa2: Ahhh It's rumoured that it increases your spiritual power, right.

5
[While the two kappas continue to babble to each other, Inuyasha starts
getting annoyed.]
Fx Inuyasha: *get irritated* <ira ira ira>
<kappa1:    he---- sora BENRI ya nee.>
kappa1: {off} Wo---w. That's handy isn't it.
<kappa2:    sorede SHIKON no TAMA ga dona ishita n-ya.
                                    =dou shita no da
>
kappa2: {off} So, what's up with the Shikon no Tama?
Myouga: ......

6
[Closeup of Myouga sitting on Inuyasha's shoulder.]
<Myouga:    Ikimashou INUYASHA-sama.>
Myouga: Let's go, Inuyasha-sama.
<Myouga:    koitsura Aho ja.>
Myouga: These guys are idiots.

[Inuyasha jumps out of a tree, and out across the sky.]
Fx Inuyasha: swish <za_>
<Myouga:    shikashi INUYASHA-sama,>
Myouga: However Inuyasha-sama,
<Myouga:    MURA o DEte kara wa ya MIKKA....>
Myouga: it's been 3 days since we left the village...
<Myouga:    mattaku TE ga kariga gozaimasen na.>
Myouga: and we have yet to find any clues...
<Inuyasha:    aa,>
Inuyasha: Yeah,
<Inuyasha:    kono MUSASHI no KUNI ni wa nee tte koto kamo na.
                              country
>
Inuyasha: It may mean that there aren't any in this country of Musashi.

(    During this period (the Sengoku Jidai) Japan was made of many warring
'countries', which were eventually united by Hideyoshi Toyotomi, though
most of the groundwork was done by Nobunaga Oda, his predecesor.)

2
[Closeup of Inuyasha noticing something, and looking slightly annoyed, perhaps.]
<Inuyasha:    n?>
Inuyasha: Hn?

3
[Kagome is standing in knee-height water in a river wearing a flowery
swimming costume, while some fishes swim around her feet. On the river bank
are Kagome's clothes, and a bucket with (presumably), shampoo and conditioner.]
Fx Kagome: splish... <zaza...>
<Kagome:    u--n, KIMOchii---.>
Kagome: Ahhh, this feels _go-o-od_.



Page 4
1
[Kagome is standing (more like posing) in the water, looking at something
off scene, while blossoms fall around her. Nice.]
Fx sound: {off} rustle... <gasa...>
<Kagome:    n?>
Kagome: Hn?

2
[Closeup of Kagome screaming.]
<Kagome:    kya-------_>
Kagome: Kyaaaaaaaaaaa!

3
[Sitting on a rocky ledge, Inuyasha shrinks back from the outburst.]
Fx Inuyasha: yikes! <biku_>

4
[Inuyasha yells at Kagome, who sweats a bit, looking flustered.]
<Inuyasha:    na_ nan da yo_,>
Inuyasha: Wh, what's up,
<Inuyasha:    temee ga KATTE ni           NUideta n-ja nee ka_.
                       one's convenience  undressed
>
Inuyasha: You undressed of your own free will didn't you!?
<Kagome:    baka_ CHIGAu_.>
Kagome: Idiot! It's not that.

5
[Inuyasha looks over to see a small, white long-armed monkey making off with
Kagome's clothes.]
Fx monkey: *eek eek* <kiki_>
<Kagome:    atashi no FUKU,>
Kagome: {off} My clothes,
<Kagome:    tori MADOshite---_.>
Kagome: {off} Get them ba--ck!
<Inuyasha:    n!?>
Inuyasha: Hn!?
<Inuyasha:    SARU!?>
Inuyasha: A monkey!?



Page 5
1
[Overlaid over a shot of the sky is a young man (around Kagome's age) in a
blue kimono, both looking travel stained. He currently has his fingers to
his lips, and is whistling.]
Fx guy: *whistle-----...* <pi--------....>

2
[The monkey bounces across the ground, holding Kagome's clothes above it.]
Fx monkey: *eek eek* <ki_>

3
[The monkey presents the clothes to its master.]
<guy:    yoshi yoshi goKUrou de atta na, HIYOSHIMARU.>
guy: Ah good, you've done well, Hiyoshimaru.

(    Hiyoshimaru = Hi (day, sun), yoshi (good luck, joy), maru - literaly means
'blade', but is also used as part of a juvenile name. According to some
folklore, Hideyoshi Toyotomi's (who was Nobunaga Oda's most loyal follower)
juevenile name was 'Hiyoshimaru', and his nickname was 'saru' (monkey)
because of his appearance.)

4
[The guy holds up Kagome's skirt and bra.]
Fx clothes: flutter... <basa...>

5
[Sweating, the man holds the clothes in front of him.]
<guy:    ko_...>
guy: Thi...

6
[The guy looks annoyed after reaching the obvious conclusion, which is a
strange way to end the last of this week's colour pages.]
<guy:    kore wa KUiMONO dewa nai_...>
guy: This isn't food...



Page 6
1
[Inuyasha suddenly pops angrily out from a bush near the guy, whose still
holding the bra, while Kagome pops out as well, keeping herself mostly
covered by the bush and looking worried.]
Fx Inuyasha: rustle! <gasa_>
<Inuyasha:    kuora_.>
Inuyasha: Hey you!
<Kagome:    FUKU KAEshite kudasai_>
Kagome: Return my clothes please!

2
[The guy suddenly draws his sword.]
Fx katana: *prepare for use* <cha_>
<guy:    na, NANIMONO!>
guy: Wh, who are you!
<guy:    ayashii YATSUra ja.>
guy: You're a suspicious lot.

3
[Side shot of Inuyasha kicking the guy in the side of the head. First time
Inuyasha does an attack with his foot.]
Fx guy: clunk... <mishi...>
<Inuyasha:    kocchi no Serifu da sore wa.>
Inuyasha: That's my line.

(    Characters from Ranma 1/2 use "That's my line" quite often, in these sorts
of situations.)

4
[Some blossom laden trees.]
Fx leaves: rustle... <sawa...>

5
[Sitting under a tree near to Kagome's bike, Kagome offers the guy a can to
drink from a huge backpack, while Inuyasha looks down from up in the tree.
In an overlaid image the guy is stuffing his face with some crisps, with
his monkey sitting on his shoulder taking some as well.]
Fx guy: *munch munch munch* <bari bari bari>
<bag:    (potato) Poteto chippusu>
bag: Potato Chips
<Kagome:    oCHA NOmu?
            tea/non-alchoholic
>
Kagome: A drink of tea?
<guy:    un.>
guy: Sure.



Page 7
1
[Holding up a small bag (on which a dog face is drawn), Kagome looks up to
Inuyasha, who's lying against the tree higher up.]
<Kagome:    INUYASHA mo nani ka TAberu-?>
Kagome: Inuyasha, are you gonna eat something too?
<Inuyasha:    irane- yo.>
Inuyasha: Don't need it.

(    The type of bag Kagome's offering to Inuyasha is typical of the style of
_dog biscuit_ bags!)

2
[Kagome continues to look up at Inuyasha who has moved around and is looking
directly back at Kagome.]
<Kagome:    TAbereba NIMOTSU KARUku naru no ni.
            if eat   parcels light  
>
Kagome: If you eat some I'll have less to carry.
<Inuyasha:    dakara...>
Inuyasha: Then...

3
[Holding her huge backpack in front of her, Kagome looks over it at Inuyasha
who is now angrily talking to her on the other side.]
<Inuyasha:    nande IDO no NAKA ni MODOru tabi ni konna dekai NI o  MOtteku n-da yo.
                    well   in      return every time    huge  load  bring back
>
Inuyasha: Then why do you bring back such a huge amount of stuff every time you come back from the Well!?
<Kagome:    KIGAe toka SHUKUDAI toka...>
Kagome: Well, there's a change of clothes, my homework...

(    Maybe Kagome pops over after school, or during the weekend, though in Japan
there's school on Saturday as well. And even though they seem to be some
distance from the Well (unless it's in Musashi), how Kagome got her bike
there is somewhat perplexing - for a start, she'd have to haul it up out of
the well, then do a lot of cross country cycling, etc.)

4
[The guy hits the bag, popping it.]
Fx bag: pop <pan>
<guy:    umai  HOshi IMO    de atta.
         tasty dried potato
>
guy: Those dried potatoes were really nice.
<guy:    REI o Iu zo, MUSUME.>
guy: You have my thanks, girl.

(    Of course, potato chips didn't exist then, but the words the guy uses to
describe them ('hoshi imo') is an old fashioned but still acceptable way to
describe this food.)

5
[Kagome stands near Inuyasha, who looks bored/annoyed, and begins the introductions.]
<Kagome:    ano... atashi,>
Kagome: Umm... I'm,
<Kagome:    kagome tte iu no.>
Kagome: called Kagome.
<Kagome:    kocchi wa INUYASHA.>
Kagome: This is Inuyasha.
<Kagome:    sore to...>
Kagome: And...

6
[Closeup of Myouga on the guy's cheek.]
Fx Myouga: *suck----* <jiyu---->
Fx Myouga: *swell swell swell* <muku muku muku>

7
[The guy slaps his cheek, squishing Myouga again.]
Fx guy: *slap* <bachi>
Fx Myouga: *squish* <buchi>

8
[View from just behind the guy as he looks over to Kagome, smiling cutely,
as the flattened Myouga flutters down.]
Fx Myouga: *flutter...* <pera...>
<Kagome:    Nomi no MYOUGA jii-chan.>
Kagome: that's Myouga the flea jii-chan.
<guy:    koyatsura NANIMONO...?>
guy: .oO(Who are these people...?).



Page 8
1
[Kagome has come up to beside the guy, looking at him slightly seriously,
they appear to be some way into a conversation.]
<Kagome:    TOMO no   MONO to hagurete NANGI    shite ita tte Itta yo ne.
            companion ppl     get lost hardship 
>
Kagome: You saying that you've been in trouble since you went astray from your attendants, aren't you.
<Kagome:    anta ii toko no oBOcchan?>
Kagome: You from a rich family, pal?
<guy:    MIBUN wa Akasenu ga...>
guy: Although I can't reveal my identity in detail...

(    Kagome really is being somewhat impolite and bold when asking the new guy
if he's from a wealthy family in the style that she uses.)

2
[Large frame of the young man introducing himself, looking serious. The can
in his left hand makes the scene rather surreal.]
Fx leaves: rustle... <zaa...>
<Nobunaga:    washi wa NOBUNAGA to MOUsu MONO.>
Nobunaga: I am the person known as Nobunaga.

(    Nobunaga's way of introduction is more formal than Kagome's and is typical
of Samurai.)

3
[Closeup of Kagome looking very surprised, and claps both hands to her cheeks.]
<Kagome:    no_ NOBUNAGA----!?>
Kagome: No, Nobunaga---!?


Page 9
1
[Kagome is now vigorously shaking Nobunaga's hands, who looks somewhat startled.]
Fx Kagome: *shake shake* <bun bun>
<Kagome:    a_ ano_ >
Kagome: Ah, umm,
<Kagome:    AKUSHU shite kudasai.
>please shake my hand
>
Kagome: It's a pleasure to meet you.
<Nobunaga:    n?>
Nobunaga: Hn?

2
[Inuyasha is looking at Kagome in surprise, while she continues to look
somewhat starteled.]
Fx Kagome: *be in a dither* <oro oro oro oro>
<Inuyasha:    ome-- Ikinari ME no IRO kawatta zo.>
Inuyasha: Hey you, you've suddenly changed your attitude.
<Kagome:    ODA NOBUNAGA yo_ SHIranai no!? CHOU YUUMEI JIN yo_.>
Kagome: He's Nobunaga Oda. Don't you know!? He's a super famous person.

(    Yes, Kagome thinks he's _the_ Nobunaga. Here's some information I pulled
from http://www.io.com/~nishio/japan/figure7.html#nobunaga.

1534-1582. Nobunaga is arguablly the most potent, the most fierce daimyo in
the era. He started as a daimyo of Owari county, and came to almost unify
Japan. Though, he was betrayed by one of his lieutenants, Akechi Mitsuhide,
and slain at Honjoji temple.

He is described as a demonic figure with no mercy. He even destroyed
Enryakuji temple in Mt. Hiei, one of the religious centers of Japanese
Buddhists. He also suppressed Jodo-shin-shu Buddhism by force. On the other
hand, Nobunaga is known as a very progressive leader. He found the potency
of tanegashima -- muskets early, and used them in battles effectively. He
also encouraged trade with European nations, and Nobunaga himself was a
Christian (his christian name was "Geronimo"). He wore a European style
plate armor in battles, rather than normal Japanese yoroi armor.

It must be noted that he didn't want to become a shogun. Instead, he wanted
to kill the emperor, destroy the dynasty that had lasted for more than 1000
years, and rise the new emperor himself. That was a too radical idea for a
man in those days. His strategy was very simple -- exterminate all of his
enemies. He seldom accepted surrender. Here is a haiku that tells his
temperature very well (though historians say the haiku was not composed by
Nobunaga himself).

If a bird doesn't sing, kill it.)


3
[Kagome is now reading from a book, while Nobunaga looks on impassively, and
Inuyasha looks on in annoyance.]
<Kagome:    WAKAi KORO wa OWARI no OOutsuke      (OO BAKA MONO)        to Iwareteta kedo,
            young time    Owrai    really unwise really stupid person     was said   but
>the parenthised bit is note to readers as utsuke is a very old world.
>
Kagome: When he was young, he was called the "Halfwit (Fool) of Owari", but
<Kagome:    1560 NEN, OKEHAZAMA no TATAKAi de IMAGAWA YOSHIMOTO o TAOshite DAI Bureiku...
                 year Okehazama    battle     Imagawa Yoshimoto   defeat   big break
>
Kagome: in the year 1560, he had a big break at the battle at Okehazama, defeating Yoshimoto Imagawa...
<book:    JUKENSEI no omoshiro NIHON-SHI?>
book: Fun Japanese History for Examinees
<Inuyasha:    nani YOnde n-da.>
Inuyasha: What's that you're reading.

(    In the text that Kagome reads out, 'utsuke' is used for fool, but this is
an old word, because some of the young readers may not know it, 'baka mono'
is given in parenthesis for them. Part of the title of the textbook implies
that it's the type of book read by middle-schoolers (like Kagome) preparing
to enter the exams for high-school, however, including the 'fun' part is
totally out of character - Rumiko Takahashi-sensei is certainly piling on
the subtle gags this week.)

4
[Closeup of Nobunaga.]
<Nobunaga:    ano- suman ga,>
Nobunaga: Umm sorry but,
<Nobunaga:    washi wa ODA no MONO dewa nai.>
Nobunaga: I'm not that Oda person.

(    The second kanji character in the name 'Oda' is 'field' (the first is
weave/fabric), and this character is also written all over Nobunaga's
kimono. In a slight parallel, Onsen Mark from Urusai Yatsura has a 'onsen'
(hot spring) mark written on his clothing, and Ukyou has the kanji for
'suki' (like) on her Okonomiyaki (lit. "As you like it") uniform. Nobunaga
is Nobu (faith/trust) naga (long/leader).)

5
[Closeup of Kagome, looking a little surprised.]
<Kagome:    e...>
Kagome: Eh...
<Kagome:    CHIGAu no?>
Kagome: I'm wrong?

6
[Nobunaga stands up and dusts his kimono off, while Kagome looks on.]
Fx Nobunaga: *dust off* <pan>
<Nobunaga:    CHISOU ni natta na.>
Nobunaga: Thanks for the food.
<Nobunaga:    mou Ikaneba.>
Nobunaga: I must get going.

[Large frame of Nobunaga walking off, looking behind him.]
<Nobunaga:    washi wa TAKEDA no MONO.>
Nobunaga: I'm a guy from Takeda.
<Nobunaga:    ano you na OWARI no utsuke to ISSHOU ni sarete wa KOMAru.
                                  unwise    mistaken
>'...shite wa komaru.' is an euphemism used to express the speaker's
>inconvenience, or to request something.
>
Nobunaga: I don't want to be mistaken for that halfwit of Owari.

2
[Nobunaga turns around completely and walks off.]
<Nobunaga:    saraba ja.>
Nobunaga: Farewell then.
<Nobunaga:    washi ni wa JUUDAI na SHIMEI ga aru no de na.>
Nobunaga: I have an important mission you see.

3
[Kagome thinks to herself with her hand on her chin, while a bit behind her
Inuyasha looks on in slight surprise.]
<Inuyasha:    a...>
Inuyasha: .oO(Ah...).
<Kagome:    ODA NOBUNAGA ja nai no ka...>
Kagome: .oO([Pity] he's not Nobunaga Oda...).

4
[The view expands to show Kagome looking over a cliff face while Inuyasha
stands next to her. Nobunaga's leg is partially seen, falling down with
him, while Hiyoshimaru looks on from a ledge.]
Fx Hiyoshimaru: *eek* <ki_>
Fx Nobunaga: rattle <karan>
<Inuyasha:    socchi wa Gake da zo.>
Inuyasha: There's a cliff that way.
<Kagome:    konna ni utsuke na no ni...>
Kagome: .oO(That's really like a halfwit though...).

2
[A few small houses can be seen of a village, while a guy on horseback is
looking behind him at a group of girls from the village have been tied
together. Some men on foot with long spears are keeping the rest of the
villagers away, who are all look quite old.]
Fx horse: (hoof) clatter  <ka_>
Fx villagers: rustle rustle... <zawa zawa...>
<guy:    yoika_, MUSUME o KAKUsu to tame ni naran zo.
                 girls    conceal

guy: Listen, you had better not conceal the girls.
<guy:    hitori     NOKOrazu          TONO ni KENJOU suru no da zo.
         one person without exception         presented to.
>
guy: They're all to be presented to the lord without a single exception.

3
[Closeup of some old men, and women behind them, talking, while looking on
with rather defeated and worried expressions.]
<villager:    ittai KUNIJUU no MUSUME o ATSUmete dousuru tsumori nan ja ro.>
villager: What on earth is he intending to do with the girls he's collecting from all over the country?
<villager:    SHIRO ni HAItta MUSUME wa, DARE HITORI     MODOtte konai to iu zo.

villager: It's said that none of the girls who enter the castle return.

[From behind some bushes Nobunaga looks at the sad and dejected looking
girls being led away.]
<Nobunaga:    na... nanto...>
Nobunaga: .oO(How.. how could they...).

2
[Closeup of Nobunaga looking on against a white background.]
<Nobunaga:    kono KUNI no TONO ga, goRANSHIN nasareta to iu UWASA...>
Nobunaga: .oO(The rumour that the lord of this country has become insane...).
<Nobunaga:    makoto de atta no ka!?>
Nobunaga: .oO(Is it really the case!?).

3
[Suddenly, behind Nobunaga Kagome and Inuyasha are talking to each other.]
<Inuyasha:    kuora kagome,>
Inuyasha: Hey Kagome,
<Inuyasha:    nande ore-tachi ga koitsu ni tsukiAwanakya nannen da yo.
              why                          socialising
>
Inuyasha: Why do we have to hang out with this guy?
<Kagome:    datte kono HITO nanda ka hottokenai ja nai.
>ja nai is prompting for Inuyasha's agreement
>
Kagome: Because I don't really feel like leaving this guy alone, you know

4
[Some village men whisper to each other.]
<villager:    koko dake no HANASHI dake do na, SHIRO no TONO-sama...
              between you and me
>
villager: Just between us, I've heard that at the castle, our lord...

5
[Side view of Inuyasha suddenly leaning forward, and stepping on Nobunaga,
while Kagome leans forward in interest as well.]
<villager:    MONO no KE ni TSUkareteru   chuu             HANASHI da zo.
              evil spirit   being haunted annotation note? story

villager: is being possessed by an evil spirit.
Fx Inuyasha: *twitch* <piku>
Fx Nobunaga: (head) *trodden on* <gyuru>

[Wide view of some buildings which have been built on top of earth which has
obviously been deliberately shaped to help defend the castle - the sides
are all reasonably smooth and are sharply angled. The only way into the set
of buildings is by a narrow bridge. This is presumably the castle of the
feudal lord of Musashi country.]
<villager:    SHIRO ni ATSUmeta MUSUME-tachi wa,
              castle   collect  maidens

villager: {off} The rumour is that at the castle where the girl's are gathered,
<villager:    TONO-sama ni TSUita MONO no KE ga,>
villager: {off} the monster which possessed our lord,

[View of some buildings in front of a pond.]
<villager:    KUcchimau tte UWAKI da.....

villager: is devouring them...

3
[Halfway inside a room is (presumably) the master of the castle being served
tea by a long haired young girl in a kimono. However, the fat looking man
is completely covered in bandages and none of his skin is visible.]
Fx lord: *odd breathing* <shu-- shu-->
<lord:    guhi_.>
lord: gruh heh
<lord:    guhihi_.>
lord: gruh heh


(    The way the lord's spoken words are written is usually reserved for
monsters only.)

bandaged arm.]
