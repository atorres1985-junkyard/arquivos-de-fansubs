Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

(off frame), while Souta stands behind her.]

<Souta:    ne, ne-chan...>

[Kagome lets go of the Mask and Inuyasha makes a massive swing with
Tetsusaiga, which leaves a bright glowing trail, from some distance away,
cutting through an iron girder and several struts and passes just in front
of Kagome.]
Fx girder: whump! <Doga_>
<Inuyasha:    ii ka_ UGOku na yo_!>
Inuyasha: Okay! Don't move!
<Inuyasha:    TETSUSAIGA!!>
Inuyasha: .oO(TETSUSAIGA!!).

<Kagome:    INUYASHA...>

[Closeup side view of Kagome looking at the fragment.]
<Kagome:    NIKUzuki no MEN....>

[Black frame with the Mask with the fragment in it's forehead.]

look at her.]

<Kagome:    INUYASHA, SAKI ni ACCHI ni KAEtte te.>

[Inuyasha looks in surprise.]
<Inuyasha:    e''.>

[Inuyasha stands looking rather dejected and angry, while next to him Souta
looks off as well.]

4
[Souta turns to look up at Inuyasha, who doesn't look amused.]
<Souta:    ano->
Souta: Umm...
<Souta:    suggoku kakko yokatta yo...>
Souta: You looked mega cool...
<Inuyasha:    ... soo ka.>
Inuyasha: ... you think so.

5
[View of the outside of Kagome's school.]

6
[In the otherwise empty exam room, Kagome, in her school clothes now, is
furiously (and tiredly) working through her exam.]
Fx Kagome: *scribble scribble scribble* <ka ka ka ka ka>
<Kagome:    NEMUi_.>
Kagome: So sleepy!
<Kagome:    demo Yama ga Atta.>
Kagome: But I correctly guessed the content.
<Kagome:    ikeru.>
Kagome: I can make it.

(    Kagome guessed what type of questions she might get and studied for them
especially, which is why she feels she's doing very well.)



Page 15
1
[Kagome is running out of the school.]
<Kagome:    yoshi Owatta.>
Kagome: Right, I'm finished.
<Kagome:    HAYAku Ikanai to,>

Page 16
1
[Running out of the school grounds, Kagome goes past two of her friends, who
smile, while behind her, a football match is in progress.]
Fx Kagome: *stop short* <pita>
<short-hair:    ganbatte ne kagome-.>
short-hair: Do your best okay, Kagome!
<hair-band:    KARESHI MAta seteru n-desho-.>
hair-band: You're making your boyfriend wait aren't you.

(    If you're wondering why there are pupils there in uniform on a Saturaday,
it's because the Japanese school week is Monday to Saturday. It's probably
time for afternoon club activities at the moment.)

3
[Kagome turns around angrily.]
<Kagome:    yada na_.>
Kagome: No way!
<Kagome:    KARESHI nanka ja nai wa yo_.>
Kagome: He's nothing like a boyfriend!

4
[Kagome continues to talk forceful at her friends, who look rather confused.]
<short-hair:    e?>
short-hair: Eh?
<Kagome:    aitsu wa tada no kusareEN_.>
Kagome: It's just an inseparable relationship with that guy!

(    This type of 'inseparable relationship' ('Kusare-en') is one that won't
break up, although none of the couple are trying to maintain it, and
neither are particularly happy with the relationship - ie Ranma and Akane
could use it to describe their situation. The use of this expression is not
limited to male/female relationships - it could include friends and
business partners.)

5
[Kagome runs off from her friends point of view.]

6
[Kagome's friends look even more confused.]
<short-hair:    datte...>
short-hair: But...
<short-hair:    kagome, TASHI ka kyou...>
short-hair: Kagome, shouldn't today...
<hair-band:    HOUJOU-kun to HATSU De-to no hazu ja...>
hair-band: be your first date with Houjou-kun...

7
[Outside the cinema, Houjou's waiting in his school uniform carrying a small present.]
Fx Houjou: *restless* <sowa sowa>
<Narration:    kagome wa HOUJOU-kun o WAsurete ita.>
Narration: Kagome has forgotten about Houjou-kun.
<Houjou:    HIGURASHI...>
Houjou: Higurashi...
<Houjou:    kono oKYUU       KI ni iru ka na.
                 moxibustion be pleased with
>
Houjou: I wonder if you'll be pleased with this moxa.

(    Moxa for moxibustion.)



Page 17

[Outside view of Kagome's house.]

2
[Kagome has that huge rucksack again, and it's packed.]
Fx rucksack: *comically heavy weight...* <zushi...>
<Kagome:    ja SOUTA,>
Kagome: Ok Souta,
<Kagome:    Itte kuru wa ne_.>
Kagome: I'm off.

3
[Kagome is staggering along with behind her Souta has Buyo the cat draped
over his shoulders.]
Fx Kagome: *comically stagger...* <zusha...>
<Souta:    ne-chan, NIMOTSU OOkisuginai?>
Souta: Nee-chan, haven't you got too much stuff?
<Kagome:    ONNA no KO wa SHITAKU ga TAIHEN na no yo__.>
Kagome: Preparation is really hard for a girl you know!

(    The normal meaning of the above sentence would be that preparing clothes,
hair, make-up etc for going out (possibly for a date), is time-consuming.)

4
[Suddenly Kagome seems to collapse backwards.]
Fx Kagome: *falling down quickly* <Zun>
Fx Kagome: *comically sudden collapse* <gaku_>
<Kagome:    kya_!?>
Kagome: Kyaa!?

5
[Sitting on the ground, Kagome turns is angry to see Inuyasha sitting on top
of the bag.]
<Inuyasha:    ke_,>
Inuyasha: Bah,
<Inuyasha:    ba-ka.>
Inuyasha: _idiot_.
<Kagome:    na_,>
Kagome: Wha,
<Kagome:    nani sun no yo-_!>
Kagome: What are you doing!?



Page 18
1
[Inuyasha picks up the bag and walks off, to Kagome's surprise.]
Fx bag: fwump <Ba_>
<Kagome:    a...>
Kagome: Ah...
<Inuyasha:    Iku zo!>
Inuyasha: We're going!

2
[Souta turns to Kagome, who gives off a little puff of anger.]
<Souta:    NIMOTSU MOtte kurete...>
Souta: He's carrying the stuff for you...
<Souta:    SHISETSU da yo ne-.>
Souta: Isn't that nice.
<Kagome:    doko ga.>
Kagome: Where's that?

3
[Inuyasha walks off towards the small shrine holding the Well, and looks
back at Kagome out of the corner of her eye. Kagome has a happy little smile.]
<Kagome:    demo...>
Kagome: .oO(However...).
<Kagome:    MAttete kureta n-da...>
Kagome: .oO(He did wait for me...).

4
[Houjou is standing outside the cinema with a small tear in his eye, and it
looks like everyone's gone in.]
Fx Houjou: *absentminded* <bo->
<Narration:    sono KORO HOUJOU-kun wa,>
Narration: About that time, Houjou-kun has,
<Houjou:    HIGURASHI...>
Houjou: Higurashi...
<Houjou:    mata TAICHOU o KUZUshita no ka?>
Houjou: did you fall ill again?
<Narration:    yappari WASUrerarete ita.>
Narration: been forgotten about after all.
