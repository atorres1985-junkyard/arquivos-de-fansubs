Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

[A view from outside the window shows that Mask's head is on the end of a
long 'neck', stretching out beyond the frame.]
Fx wind: who-o-o-sh... <hyu---->

2
[View of a car (looks rather like a Porshe) being driven through the night.]
Fx car: vrooom... <bo---...>
<girl:    kowa~i, nanka DEsou na TOKORO ne_ UMAO-san.
                                 place

<Umao:    sore ga HONTOU ni DEru n-da ze~~ SHIKAKO-san.>
Umao: {off} It re~e~aly does appear, Shikako-san.

3
[Inside the car are a young man and woman, dressed up, (probably coming back
from a date), with the guy at the wheel, and the woman putting her hands to
her cheeks in mock-fear.]
<Umao:    hikiNIGE sareta      ONNA no Yu-rei.

<Shikako:    kya~~ kowai~~ n.>

[The man gives a happy whistle, and the woman bops him on the shoulder.]
<Umao:    na-nchatte Usopyo~n.
                     lie-??
>
Umao: Just kidding - I made it all up.
<Shikako:    iya~n bakabaka~n>
Shikako: Ooohh, you silly guy~.

(    The protagonist of the series 'Moon dai pet oo' ('Moon big pet king'), uses
speach like Umao - specifically, the style of Japanese used for 'I made it
all up'.)

5
[Suddenly ahead of them they see the Mask standing in the middle of the
road, with it's face stretched out up into the air, like a second neck.]
Fx air: (rushing past car) whoosh--- <go---->

6
[Partial closeup of the two, looking surprised.]
<Umao and Shikako:    e''>
Umao and Shikako: _Eh!?_


(    If the 'uma' (horse) of Umao and 'shika' (deer) of Shikako are combined as
one word, the result is 'baka' (idiot).)

4
[The dark shadow of the Mask lurches it's bleeding body off into the distance.]

>
Inuyasha: .oO(Without a companion to tease, I can't get in the mood.).

(    Inuyasha is actually admitting here that he likes teasing Kagome, in a way.
It's also interesting, that in Ranma 1/2 volume 36, Ranma (and Genma)
temporarily moved out of the Tendo house, and back into the Saotome house,
with Nodoka, and Ranma got rather depressed...)

<Houjou:    FUme yo.>
Houjou: tread on it.
<Kagome:    haa...>

<head-band:    Iku no!?>

4
[While Houjou is now some way off, Kagome's short haired friend whispers to
Kagome, who looks rather shocked.]
<short-hair:    Ikeba?>
short-hair: Why not go?
<short-hair:    kagome, De-to shita koto nai deshou.>
short-hair: Kagome, you haven't been on a date before have you.
<Kagome:    Ba,>
Kagome: Do,
<Kagome:    Baka ni shinai de yo.>
Kagome: don't underrate me!
<Kagome:    De-to kurai...>
Kagome: Going on a date is just...

5
[Closeup of Kagome realising something to her shock.]
<Kagome:    shita koto nai...>
Kagome: .oO(I haven't gone on one...).

(    Kagome is trying to give the impression to her friends that going on a date
is no big deal in the above sentence.)

embarrassed, while behind her, Houjou looks rather happy.]

[Outside the staff-room, Kagome stands in front of the teacher, looking
