Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

[Instead of a stand-alone chapter picture, it is a continuation of the scene
at the end of the previous chapter. In the room, the tono is standing a few
meters in front of Kagome, in a slightly threatening pose, and just behind
Kagome is Inuyasha crashed on the floor, and just behind him are Tsuyuhime
and Nobunaga, holding each other. Surrounding them are many large eggs
mostly filled with adult-looking naked women in the fetal position.]

left shoulder, and with a bow and bag on her back. A closeup is shown of
several of the eggs, one with a woman who has mostly become just a head and tail.]

pooling near him.]

little sweat drop.]

bouncing along her shoulder.]

Myouga: Even boiling oil will do.
<Kagome:    ONAji koto yo_.>
Kagome: Same difference!

(    Yup, this series deffinately isn't like Ranma 1/2 (in many ways) - quite
often, hot water kettles just appear out of nowhere...)

look at him at this.]

[Inuyasha turns to speak derisively to Nobunaga, and Kagome look quite
surprised at his words.]
<Inuyasha:    _taku, yappa Baka da ze koitsu.>
Inuyasha: Jeez, you're a idiot after all.
<Inuyasha:    KOROsare so- ni nari-nagara KOIGATAKI no INOCHIGOi shiyagatte yo-.
              murder                      love rival   plead for life
>
Inuyasha: You were pleading for your love rival's fucking life while you were about to be killed.
Fx Nobunaga: *twitch* <piku>

[Side view of Nobunaga.]
Fx Nobunaga: (sighing) huh... <fu...>

8
[Side view of Nobunaga looking up.]
<Nobunaga:    sou da na...>
Nobunaga: Yeah, you're right...
<Nobunaga:    washi wa Baka da...>
Nobunaga: I am an idiot...

<Inuyasha:    demo na,>
Inuyasha: {off} Except,

[With his arms folded together and carries on speaking with his eyes closed.]
<Inuyasha:    sono Bakasa KAGEN ga HITO hitori TASUketa n-da.>
Inuyasha: that foolishness ended up saving [the life of] one person.
<Inuyasha:    sore de i- ja nee ka.>
Inuyasha: That's good enough, isn't it.

[Closeup of Nobunaga looking a little happy.]
<Nobunaga:    ... sou Itte kureru ka.>
Nobunaga: .oO(....It's nice to hear that.).

[Using a staff to prop himself up, Nobunaga begins to walk off, looking
rather happy.]
Fx Nobunaga: shh <za_>
<Nobunaga:    yoshi_ GENKI ga DEta.>
Nobunaga: Allright! I feel better.
<Nobunaga:    Iku zo_.>
Nobunaga: I'm off!

[Inuyasha and Kagome look to where Nobunaga is in some surprise.]
<Kagome:    e...>
Kagome: Eh...
<Kagome:    Iku tte...>
Kagome: You're going...
<Inuyasha:    NOBUNAGA...>
Inuyasha: Nobunaga...

[The scene expands to show Nobunaga falling down another cliff, with Kagome
and Inuyasha looking down from the edge.]
Fx rocks: clatter... <karan...>
<Inuyasha:    socchi wa Gake da zo.>
Inuyasha: There's a cliff that way.
<Kagome:    yappari Baka na no kashira...>
Kagome: .oO(I wonder if he's an idiot after all...).


(    Kagome was seemingly impressed by Nobunaga's human rights stance (and maybe
thought he wasn't such an idiot after all), but maybe she now thinks that
his belief was mostly because of his foolishness. Compared to the
historical Nobunaga Oda, this one is very different - pretty much opposite.)
