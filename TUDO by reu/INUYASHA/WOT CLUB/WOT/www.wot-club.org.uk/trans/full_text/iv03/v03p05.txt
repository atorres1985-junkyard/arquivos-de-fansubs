Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

year text book, and her smiling face is turned towards us.]

(    The literal meaning of the title would be something like "The Mask that
sticks/adheres to flesh".)

Narration: Musashi Country

[Close of Kaede.]
<Kaede:    kagome to INUYASHA ga MODOtte KIta to?>
Kaede: Kagome and Inuyasha have come back you say?

3
[Kaede is standing on a ridge between fields, talking to a farmer who is
ploughing his field with the aid of an ox.]
<villager:    hee, KAEDE-sama sore ga...>
villager: Yeah, well Kaede-sama...
<villager:    FUTARI tomo KAEtte kuru nari...
              2 ppl       return      as soon as
>
villager: As soon as they both came back...

[Kaede turns to look away.]
<villager:    KESSOU kaete HONEKUi no IDO no  HOU ni HASHItte Iki yori mashita.
              in a hurry   bone gobbling well        run
>
villager: they rushed off towards the Bone Gobbling Well.
<Kaede:    mata ka>
Kaede: Again?

5
[High-speed view of someone moving quickly though a forest.]
Fx sound: swish-swish-swish <za za za>
<Inuyasha:    MAchi yagare kagome-_.>
Inuyasha: {off} Just you bloody wait Kagome-!

[Closeup of Inuyasha running across the frame, looking angry.]
<Inuyasha:    teme--- NIgeru KI ka-.
                      run way
>
Inuyasha: Hey bi-i-ch, you chickening out?

2
[Kagome turns around, while riding her bike, on the back of which is the
large (and now rather empty looking) bag from 4 chapters ago.]
Fx bike: *speeding---* <sha--->
<Kagome:    dakara_,>
Kagome: So I've been saying,
<Kagome:    sugu KAEtte KUru tte Itteru desho-.>
Kagome: I'll come back soon - don't you get it!?

3
[Inuyasha jumps right in front of the Bone Gobbling Well, just as Kagome
reaches it and she slams on the brakes.]
Fx Inuyasha: swish <za_>
Fx bike: *slide to a halt* <sha_>
<Inuyasha:    SHIKON no TAMA ATSUme wa do-su n'da yo_.>
Inuyasha: What about collecting the Shikon no Tama.

4
[Closeup of Kagome speaking forcefully.]
<Kagome:    doite.>
Kagome: Step aside.
<Kagome:    ASHITA kara Tesuto na no yo.>
Kagome: I have tests from tomorrow.

5
[Closeup of Kagome looking rather worried.]
<Kagome:    atashi CHUUSAN na no yo, KOUKOU      JUKEN hikaeteru no.
              middle school 3rd year high school exams make notes
>
Kagome: I'm in the 3rd year of middle school, and my high-school entrance exams are coming up soon.
<Kagome:    kono mama ja SHUSSEKI NISSUU datte TArinaku   nacchau shi...
                         attendance            insufficient   
>
Kagome: If things continue like this, I won't get a good enough attendance... 


(    In the story, it's probably May, but even though it's nearly a year until
the high-school entrance exams (which are in February/March), because of
the difficulty and seriousness of the exams, it is actually important to
start studying for them early.)

[Kagome lets her bike fall to the ground as Inuyasha picks up a boulder and
holds it above the Well.]
<Kagome:    tte, nani yatte n-no.
>implication of 'tte' is "While I'm explaining this,.."
>
Kagome: I said. What are you doing?
Fx bike: clatter <pata>
<Inuyasha:    fu_...>
Inuyasha: Heh...
Fx boulder: *large heavy object being lifted...* <zugogo...>

2
[View of inside the Well, from Inuyasha's point of view.]
<Inuyasha:    kono HONEKUi no IDO ga naku narya,>
Inuyasha: {off} If this Bone Gobbling Well ain't here,
<Inuyasha:    ome- wa mukou no Hen na KUNI ni Ikenaku naru n-daro-.>
Inuyasha: {off} you won't be able go to that _weird_ country on the other side, will you.

3
[Closeup of Inuyasha starting to throw the boulder down.]
Fx air: whoosh <go_>
<Inuyasha:    bu_ KOWAshite yaru!!>
Inuyasha: I will smash it apart!!

4
[Closeup of Kagome panicing.]
<Kagome:    osuwari_!>
Kagome: Si-i-t!

5
[While stepping up onto the Well's ridge, Kagome continues to yell at Inuyasha.]
<Kagome:    7 x osuwari>
Kagome: Sit sit sit sit sit sit sit!
Fx Inuyasha: *creak creak squeak* <gishi gishi mishi>
<Inuyasha:    guoooo_.>
Inuyasha: Guwaaaa.

[Closeup of Kagome turning to Inuyasha, off frame.]
<Kagome:    MAKKA tattara MODOtte kuru kara,>
Kagome: In three days I'll come back, so
<Kagome:    ZE___TTAI Otte KOnai de yo_.>
Kagome: ab-so-lutely don't come after me.

2
[View of Kagome falling down through the well.]
Fx Kagome: fwip <ba_>

3
[A residential area in modern city.]
Fx birds: *tweet tweet* <chichi...>

4
[View of the small shrine holding the Bone Gobbling Well in Kagome's time.]
<Souta:    ji-chan, HONTOU ni KIku no~?
                              be effective
>
Souta: {off} Jii-chan, that prayer you're doing,
<Souta:    sonna KITOU.>
Souta: {off} will it rea-a-ly work?



Page 6
1
[Kagome's grandfather is wearing formal priest's robes.]
<jii-chan:    KIku.>
jii-chan: It will.
<jii-chan:    kono KITOU wa waga HIGURASHI JINJA ni DAIDAI         TSUTAwaru   YUISHO  TADAshii
                   prayer                  shrine  for generations handed down history perfect
>
jii-chan: This is an authentic prayer that has been handed down for generations at our Higurashi Shrine...

(    Until this chapter, we haven't been given a furigana 'spelling' of the name
of the Higurashi Shrine - so I have been using the more obvious 'Higure'
(dusk) reading. The meanings of Higurashi are 1 - (noun) passing a day,
spending a day, 2 - (adverb) all the day, all day long.)

2
[The view expands to show the old guy throwing burning paper into the Well,
and Souta sitting on the steps leading down to the Well with Buyo the cat
on his lap. Beside the old man is a tall bucket.]
Fx paper: *catching align* <po_ po_>
<Souta:    mo- MIKKA mo yatteru kedo,>
Souta: But you've been doing it for three days already -
<Souta:    ne-chan KAEtte konai ja-n.>
Souta: nee-chan isn't coming home.
<jii-chan:    ka~e~ri~ ta~ma~e~ mo~do~ri~ ta~ma~e~>
jii-chan (chanting): You~ may~ re~tu~rn, you~ may~ co~me ba~ck~

(    The style jii-chan is using is similar to that of an authentic Shintoism
prayer. However, here it sounds like an impromptu variation - ie jii-chan
is making it up on the spot, and so much for "handed down through the generations.")

3
[Kagome touches down at the bottom of the Well.]
Fx Kagome: shh <za_>
<Kagome:    yoshi_ TSUita_.>
Kagome: Good, I've arrived.

4
[Kagome stands up and notices some bits of burning paper falling down.]
Fx burning paper: *flutter down* <hara hara>
<Kagome:    n?>
Kagome: Hn?

5
[At the top of the Well, the old man upends the contents of the bucket down
into the Well.]
<jii-chan:    sorei_,>
jii-chan: And now,
<jii-chan:    KIYOme no oMIKI!>
jii-chan: the purificating sacred wine!
Fx wine: splish <za_>



Page 7

[Rather wet, Kagome glares up at her grandfather, who looks rather pleased
with himself. Lucky that wasn't Ranma there, eh.]
<jii-chan:    oo_ kagome_.>
jii-chan: Aahh, Kagome!
<jii-chan:    waga INOri  JOUJUU seri!
                   prayer complete
>
jii-chan: My prayer has reached it's conclusion!
Fx Kagome: shiver <furu furu>
<Kagome:    jiichan...>
Kagome: Jii-chan...

2
[View of a taxi being driven along the streets.]
<taxi-driver:    HIGURASHI JINJA... ne.>
taxi-driver: {off} The Higurashi Shrine... right?
<taxi-driver:    o-KYAKU-san, konna ASAppara kara  oHARAi demo sun-no
                                    early morning  exorcism     
>
taxi-driver: {off} O-kyaku-san, are you going for an exorcism or something so early in the morning?

(    "O-kyaku-san" is a polite way to address your customers and guests.)

3
[View from inside the taxi of a middle-aged man at the wheel, driving a
middle-aged woman wearing glasses and looking dressed up. On her lap is a
wide, wrapped up box.]
<lady:    ee.>
lady: That's right.
<lady:    SENDAI ga   NAkunatte, MONGAIFUSHUTSU toka no     FURUi oMEN oshitsukerare chatte ne.
          predecessor die        never let out of the house old   mask being forced
>
lady: My predecessor died, and the old mask that had never been allowed out of the house was forcibly passed on to me.
<taxi-driver:    oMEN desu kaa?>
taxi-driver: A mask?

4
[Frame of a woman in a poor room from some earlier age with her hands around
the mask on her face.]
<lady:    NIKUzuki no MEN te itte,>
lady: {off} It's called the "Plastering Mask",
<lady:    KABUru to, sono HITO ga SHInu made KAO kara wa garenai n'desu tte.>
lady: {off} If it's worn, until that person dies, they can't take it off their face, it's said.
<taxi-driver:    Hee, okkanai nee.>
taxi-driver: Hmm, that's frightening.

[View of some warriors riding on horses, against a backdrop of flame.]
<lady:    SENGOKU JIDAI ni HOrareta mono rashii n'dakedo, >
lady: It's said to be have been made in the Sengoku Jidai, but
<lady:    HI ni YAkaretemo MOenai shi.
                bake       not burn
>
lady: even if it's baked in a fire, it won't burn.

2
[View of the mask against a black background. It has a long scar running
down it's right cheek and over the eye and other scar over the lips.]
<lady:    KOWAsou to shite KIZUtsukereba  FUKITSU na SHI ni KATA suru tte iu shi,
          break            if get damaged unlucky    death  
>
lady: As it's said that if it gets damaged when trying to break it, you'll die in an ill-omened way,
<lady:    ikura MEISHIN datte nanda ka nee.>
lady: even though it's superstition, it's kind of... [scary] you know.

3
[The lady is now standing on the steps leading up towards the shrine,
holding the box in her hands.]
Fx leaves: rustle... <sawa...>
<sign:    HIGURASHI JINJA>
sign: Higurashi Shrine

[View of the house.]
<mother:    kagome,>
mother: {off} Kagome,
<mother:    SEIFUKU KAWAita wa yo.>
mother: {off} I've dried your uniform.
<Kagome:    arigato- Mama.>
Kagome: {off} Thanks mama.

2
[Kagome and Souta are now walking down the steps, with Souta turning back
towards Kagome.]
<Souta:    INU no ni-chan wa TSUrete konakatta no?>
Souta: Didn't you bring that dog guy with you?
<Kagome:    ATAri MAE desho.>
Kagome: Of course not.
<Kagome:    furikitte kuru no TAIHEN datta n-dakara.
            shake off
>
Kagome: It was really bad shaking him off when I came back.

(    For 'that dog guy', Souta says "Inu no nii-chan" is sort of an alternative
to "Inu[yasha]-nii-chan", but as he doesn't know Inuyasha well,
he's being quite impolite here.)

4
[Kagome and Souta notice something.]
<Souta:    are?>
Souta: Huh?
<Kagome:    n?>
Kagome: Hn?

5
[At the bottom of the steps is the lady, with the opened box on the ground.]
Fx lady: shhh... <zaa...>

6
[Closeup of empty box and the lady's broken glasses on the ground.]
Fx lady: rustle... <zawa...>

[Souta and Kagome look down curiously.]
<Souta:    oKYAKU-san ka na...>
Souta: An o-kyaku-san perhaps...

and over the eye, and other one over her lips. She looks a bit creepy.]

Fx Kagome: *shiver* <zoku>
Fx Souta: yikes! <biku_>

3
[Kagome and Souta have walked down the steps and are now moving away from
the unmoving woman.]
Fx Kagome and Souta: *sneak* <koso_>
<Souta:    na... nanka KIMOCHI WARUi.>
Souta: Sh... she's kinda creepy.
<Kagome:    shi_,>
Kagome: Shh,
<Kagome:    SHITSUREI desho SOUTA.>
Kagome: That's rude isn't it Souta.

[Closeup of Kagome.]
Fx Kagome: *peek* <chira>
<Kagome:    demo... nanka NOUMEN mitai na KAO.>
Kagome: .oO(But... somehow it looks like a Noh mask face.).
<Kagome:    sore ni ano KIZU...>
Kagome: .oO(And also that cut...).

[Side view of the lady's face - there's nothing indicating that she's
wearing a mask.]
Fx lady: rustle <sawa>

[Closeup of Kagome looking a little surprised.]

Fx leaves: rustle... <sawa...>

Souta: Let's go nee-chan.
<Kagome:    u... un.>
Kagome: Y... yeah.

6
[Side view of Kagome moving off.]
Fx Kagome: *step* <ta_>
<Kagome:    nanka HEN na KANji na dakedo...>
Kagome: .oO(Somehow I have this weird feeling, but...).
<Kagome:    KOCCHI ni made YOUKAI ga iru wake nai shi na-.
kocchi has kanji for gendai (present age)
>
Kagome: .oO(There's no reason for Youkai to be here [in this time] is there.).

[The lady turns to look back.]

[View of a rather typical school with students walking in, and overlaid,
Kagome arrives.]
<Kagome:    ohhayo-_.>
Kagome: Morning!

2
[Some girls turn to look at Kagome, one with short hair, one with a white
band in her hair and one with a perm, all wearing the same uniform as Kagome.]
<short-hair:    kagome_.>
short-hair: Kagome!
<head-band:    mou GAKKOU KIte HEIKI na no?>
head-band: Is it okay to come to school again?

3
[Kagome looks in confusion at head-band girl and short-hair girl.]
<Kagome:    e?>
Kagome: Eh?
<head-band:    SAIKIN YASUMI  OOi kara, SHINPAIshite antanchi ni DENWA shitara.
               recent holiday many      worry        gloomy?     phone
>
head-band: When we phoned your home because of all your recent absences,

4
[Standing with her back to us, Kagome is obviously shocked at what her
friends say.]
<short-hair:    KONDO wa gikkuri GOSHI da tte?>
short-hair: we heard you got a strained back this time. Right?
<head-band:    sono MAE wa TOUNYOUBYOU no KENSA       NYUUIN datta tte iu shi... anta DAIJOUBU? 
                           diabetes       examination hospitalisation
>
head-band: Before that, he said it was a hospital examination for diabetes... are you okay?


(    Evidently Kagome has not been to school in some time. You may wonder why
she was wearing her school uniform during the last story, especially as
(due to the large bag she'd brought along), she expected to be away for
several days. Maybe she's deliberately going along with all the other
anime/manga teenage girls who get sucked into another world, and continue
to wear their school uniforms...)

[Gripping her hand in anger, Kagome has a small tear just below her eye as
she imagines her grandfather talking on the phone.]

reminds me of Nobunaga for some reason.]
Fx bike: (breaks) *squeek* <ki_>
<boy:    HIGURASHI,>
boy: Higurashi,
<boy:    mou KARADA ii no?>
boy: are you well again?

(    Higurashi is likely to be Kagome's family name.)

3
[Kagome turns in surprise, and Kagome's friends are surprised.]
Fx girls: *gasp* <kya_>
<Kagome:    e..?>
Kagome: Eh...?
<head-band:    Bi- GUMI no HOUJOU-kun n-da.>
head-band: It's Houjou-kun from B-Class.

4
[Houjou stands in front of Kagome, who looks down and has a tear in her eye.]
Fx wind: *gentle breeze....* <sa---...>
<Houjou:    TSUUFUU da tte? WAKAi no ni TAIHEN da na>
Houjou: It was gout, right? That's really bad at a young age.
<Kagome:    chi_ CHIGAu_...>
Kagome: .oO(You, you got it wrong...).

5
[Closeup of Houjou.]

little plastic bumps on the bottom.]

[The boy turns and leaves.]
Fx bike: (bell) jingle <chiririn>
<Houjou:    KENKOU Sandaru.>
Houjou: It's a health sandal.
<Houjou:    hake yo_.>
Houjou: Put it on.
<Houjou:    ja_.>
Houjou: Bye.

4
[Kagome looks on in surprise.]
<Kagome:    haa...>
Kagome: Huhh...

5
[Kagome friends suddenly crowd around Kagome.]
<short-hair and perm-hair:    chotto kagome_.>
short-hair and perm-hair: Just a sec Kagome!
<head-band:    HOUJOU-kun to tsukiatte n-no!?>
head-band: You're going out with Houjou-kun!?

6
[Closeup of Kagome speaking matter of factly.]
<Kagome:    masaka.>
Kagome: No way.
<Kagome:    sonna HIMA nai yo.>
Kagome: I've no time for that.

7
[Kagome's friends look off in the direction the boy went.]
<short-hair:    demo HOUJOU-kun kagome ni KI ga aru n-da-.>
short-hair: But, Houjou-kun is interested in Kagome.
<perm-hair:    Shokku-.>
perm-hair: Quite a shock.

<Kagome:    da- tte.>
Kagome: But...
<head-band:    kagome_ moshi kashite...>
head-band: Kagome, could it be that...

3
[Perm-hair suddenly moves up to Kagome, who angrily replies.]
<perm-hair:    anta, mou KARESHI iru n-da?>
perm-hair: you... already have a boyfriend?
<Kagome:    inai wa yo sonna no.>
Kagome: No, I don't have one.

4
[Kagome's friends all edge up to Kagome, and a boy in the class turns to
look on.]
<short-hair:    HONTOU!?>
short-hair: Really!?
<short-hair:    HONTOU ni inai no!?>
short-hair: You really don't have one!?
<head-band:    dattara, anta do-yu- Taipu ga i- no!?>
head-band: If it comes to that, what's your type!?

Kagome: Yeah...
<Kagome:    yappari...>
Kagome: It would be...

looking behind her to where Inuyasha is crawling along the floor, looking
majorly annoyed.]
