text: this time, twice as many cel pics [as the previous work] are going to be used, [the staff] says.

(    The 'better than film quality' may mean that (some parts of) the advert has
a higher frame rate - ie, for action sequences, 30 frames per second as is
NTSC, compared to 24 frames per second for film. Since the time for the
previous advert is probably the same, this implies (to me) that the
Inuyasha advert has a lot more action sequences, rather than still frame
pans and zooms. Note: NTSC is 60 interlaced-half-frames a second = 30
complete frames, and I'm just guessing that the animators doesn't consider
there to be much point in doing more than 30 frames a second.)
