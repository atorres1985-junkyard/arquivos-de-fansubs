Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

(    Some young girls (older occationally too) will use their name instead of
saying 'I', which is a more diminutive way of speaking. However, Naraku and
Sesshoumaru do something similar, except they say "kono Naraku" ("this
Naraku" literally, but I've translated it as "I, Naraku") and "kono
Sesshoumaru", which is rather the opposite - they think well of themselves.)
