Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

Naraku: Yes... I know you're the type that hates to be instructed by other people, Sesshoumaru-sama...

(    I'm not sure why Naraku is still saying Sesshoumaru-sama instead of just
Sesshoumaru. Maybe he's mocking Sesshoumaru slightly or trying to lull him
into a false sense of security or something...)

6
[View of some logs burning in a stand.]
<Naraku:    Iinari ni INUYASHA o KOROsu denaku,>

>
Sesshoumaru: You sure wanted to lure me out, didn't you...

3
[View of Sesshoumaru - his faces has hardened and he's holding up his right
hand, and the background has gone all dark.]
<Sesshoumaru:    YOUKEN wa ato de yukkuri KIite yarou.>
Sesshoumaru: We will discuss your intentions later.
<Sesshoumaru:    kisama ga Ikite itara no HANASHI daga na.>
Sesshoumaru: If you're still alive that is.
Fx Sesshoumaru: *stir of power...* <Zawa...>

4
[Closeup of Naraku's face under the baboon pelt (it's the real Naraku) who
