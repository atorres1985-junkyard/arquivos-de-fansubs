Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

[View of a wide clearing with tall grass. In the middle is an old (human it
seems) woman with a staff, who appears to be waiting for something.]
Fx grass: rustle... <Zawa...>

[Out of the grass jumps a medium sized Youkai, a bit like a giant weasel or
some kind of rodent.]
Fx youkai: swish <Za_>
Fx youkai: hshht <Sha-->

3
[Closeup of the old woman, reaching into a jar. She's wearing some
reasonably good quality clothes (obviously not a peasant) and has a rather
weathered face (slightly comical too it seems to me)]
<old woman:    nu!>
old woman: Grn!
Fx old woman: (to jar) shh <Za_>

[The woman throws some kind of powder at the Youkai jumping at her.]

Fx old woman: swish <Za_>

[The old woman makes a swipe with her staff but the Youkai dodges out of the way.]
Fx old woman: *missed swing* <suka_>
Fx youkai: swish <Za_>
<old woman:    a".>
old woman: _Ah_.

4
[The Youkai now comes at the old woman before she can ready another attack.]
Fx youkai: hshht... <Sha--->
<old woman:    uwa_.>
old woman: Uwha!

[Streaked action frame.]
<Inuyasha:    SANKON TESSOU!>

[Scene change. View of the sky.]
<Miroku:    YOUKAI ga fuete iru?>
Miroku: {off} The number of Youkai are increasing?

5
[The group are now sitting down beside some trees talking to the old woman.]
<old woman:    aa, SAIKIN KYUU ni na.>
old woman: Yeah, it started suddenly, recently.
<old woman:    sorede konna Oibore no oHARAi-YA made KAri DAsarete-ru to iu WAKE yo.>
old woman: That's why even an old o-harai-ya like me has been brought out.
<Miroku:    haa...>
Miroku: I see...
<Miroku:    RIYUU wa wakaranai no de?>
Miroku: Do you have any idea why?

(    "o-harai-ya" is a professional exorciser. This can be used as a term of
address too.)

[Closeup of the old woman making a point.]
<old woman:    osoraku TATAri no sei ja yo.>

[Drawing of a large castle estate with a dark menacing aura around it.]
<old woman:    chanto shita NA ga aru n-darou ga, minna ONI no KUBI-JOU to YOndo-ru yo.>
old woman: {voice over} It does have a proper name, but everybody calls it Oni's Head Castle.
<old woman:    SHIRO no CHIKA ni ONI no KUBI ga Umatte-ru to iu n-ja.>
old woman: An Oni's head was buried beneath the castle, it's said.

4
[View of the old woman and Kagome.]
<old woman:    nandemo JOUSHU no SENZO ga TAIJIshita ONI no KUBI o,>
old woman: The lord of the castle from long ago took the head of an Oni he'd exterminated,
<old woman:    MAYOke gawari ni Ume, sono UE ni SHIRO o TAte-ta to iu koto da.>
old woman: burying it as a substitute for a charm against evil, and built his castle on top of it.
<Kagome:    hee...>
Kagome: Wow...

[View of Sango and Miroku.]
<old woman:    shikashi doumo CHIKAGORO, sono ONI ga IKI o FUkikaeshi TATAtte iru to iu.>
old woman: {off} However somewhat recently, that Oni has come back to life and cursed the area.
<old woman:    oHARAi mo kotogotoku SHIPPAIshite-ru to iu shi-->

old woman: Didn't you say you were traveling Youkai exterminators?

4
[Kagome turns to Inuyasha.]
<Kagome:    dou suru?>
Kagome: What'll we do?
<Inuyasha:    sonna HIMA ne- daro.>
Inuyasha: We don't have time for this.

5
[Inuyasha and Miroku talk, while the old woman looks at them.]
<Inuyasha:    NARAKU o SAGAsu no ga SENKETSU da.>
Inuyasha: Looking for Naraku is the priority.
<Miroku:    shikashi HANASHI o KIita IJOU...>
Miroku: But, after hearing this story...
<old woman:    houbi ga tanmari MORAeru rashii zo.>
old woman: Apparently there's a significant reward.

6
[Miroku walks off with the old woman, while Inuyasha watches in annoyance.]
<Miroku:    mairi mashou.>
Miroku: Let's go.
<old woman:    MOUke wa YAMAWAke ja zo.>
old woman: We'll split the takings 50-50.

[Scene change to a view of a Japanese castle, presumably Oni's Head Castle.]
Fx sound: rustle... <Zawa...>

2
[Inside a room in the castle, a serving girl is kneeling on the floor
looking rather scared - someone is holding a sword in front of her.]
<serving girl:    to, TONO, oYURUshi kudasai.>
serving girl: To, Tono, please forgive me.

(    "Tono" is a title used to address the lord of the castle.)

<serving girl:    WATASHI wa nanimo MIte ori masen.>
serving girl: I haven't seen anything.
<serving girl:    MIte ori masen!>

[Scene change - view of the sky.]
<old woman:    TONO no goYOUsu ga?>
old woman: Tono's condition is?

6
[The group are seated in the castle courtyard, with the old woman in front,
with an oldish man sitting on the platform in front of them - head guy in
running the estate probably.]
<old man:    SHINJO ni KOMOtta mama... DEte KOrarenai.>
old man: Since secluding himself in the bedroom... he won't come out.



Page 9
1
[Kagome sidles up to Inuyasha.]
<Kagome:    nee, INUYASHA.>
Kagome: Say, Inuyasha.
<Kagome:    nanka kono oSHIRO... KIMOchi WARUkunai?>
Kagome: Somehow, don't you get... a bad feeling about this castle?

2
[Miroku and Sango have considering looks, while the old woman looks at them, unimpressed.]
<Miroku:    ONI no JAKI ka...>
Miroku: .oO(The evil aura from the Oni huh...).
<Sango:    SHIRO-JUU ni TADAYOtte-ru na.>
Sango: .oO(It's floating over the entire castle.).
<old woman:    nn? doushita omae-ra, Ukanu KAO o shite.>

3
[Closeup of the old woman.]
<old woman:    ojikezuita n-ja arumai na?>
old woman: Are you overcome with fear?
<old woman:    _taku WAKAi kuse ni darashinai.>
old woman: Sheesh, you youngsters are pathetic.

4
[Miroku comes over curiously to the old woman.]
<Miroku:    ...to MOUshi masu ka, HARAiYA-sama wa nanimo oKANji ni naranai no de?>
Miroku: ...you mean Harai-ya-sama, that you can't feel anything?
<old woman:    nani o?>
old woman: Feel what?
Fx old woman: *calmly* <kero_>

5
[Inuyasha, Kagome and Shippou seem a bit surprised.]
<Inuyasha:    kono babaa Inchiki ja nee no ka?>
Inuyasha: Is this babaa a fraud or something?
<Shippou:    ora demo JAKI o KANjiru no ni.>
Shippou: Even I can feel the evil aura.

(    "babaa" is colloquial for "old woman" - more like "old bat" or something.
Inuyasha also calls Kaede, Kaede-babaa.)

6
[Kagome notices two castle workers to the side, who are carrying a stretcher
with someone covered by straw/mats - typical for a corpse.]
Fx workers: skrsh skrsh <Za_ Za_>



Page 10

[Closeup of the corpse, mostly covered by the mat. It seems to be the girl
from earlier.]
Fx worker: *walking over ground...* <Zaku...>

[The others notice this.]

[Closeup of the oldish guy in charge. He seems rather nervous.]
<old man:    mou kore de JUUNIN-me ja...>
old man: This is the 10th one...

4
[Drawing of what is presumably the Tono of the castle, sitting sullenly in a
room, holding a blood-stained sword. There's a dark aura in the room, and
he looks rather thin.]
<old man:    TONO wa, SHINJO ni CHIKAzuita JIJO ya KASHIN o kotogotoku TEUchi ni sareru.>
old man: {voice over} Tono has attacked every maid or retainer who's gone near the bedroom.
Fx Tono: *strained breathing* <Shu--->

5
[View of Miroku, the old woman and the oldish man, who looks a bit depressed.]
<Miroku:    TONO no goRANSHIN mo ONI no TATAri no sei da yo?>
Miroku: The Tono's madness is due to the Oni's curse too?
<old man:    osoraku...>
old man: Probably...



Page 11

[View of the sky.]
<old man:    ONI wa HI ga KUreru to ARAWAreru.>
old man: {off} The Oni appears when the sun's gone down.
<old man:    sore made kono BA de hikaete ore.>
old man: Don't move from this place until then.

[The group is sitting on the ground, waiting, not looking entirely happy.
The old woman seems fine and is doing some stretching exercises.]
<old woman:    MINA, KI o HIkishimete na.>
old woman: Everyone, be on your guard.
Fx old woman: (bones) pop pop <kuki kuki>
<Inuyasha:    GENKI da na- babaa.>

<Shippou:    ho-nto kono JAKI no NAKA de...>

[Closeup of Miroku with a serious expression.]
<Miroku:    SHUGYOU o tsunda MI demo, kono SHIRO no JAKI wa IGOKOCHI ga WARUi.>
Miroku: Even with a trained body, the evil in this castle is uncomfortable.

4
[Miroku looks at Sango.]
<Miroku:    sassa to TAIJIshitara totto to KAEri mashou.>
Miroku: Let's exterminate it quickly and get back.
<Sango:    sou da ne.>
Sango: Yeah.

5
[Miroku and Sango look to the side as someone approaches.]
<voice:    ONI o HARAi ni KIta MONO-tachi desu ka?>
voice: Are you the people come to exorcise the Oni?



Page 12
1
[View of a young woman in a rich kimono - presumably the daughter of the
lord. She seems to be in late teens, or maybe early twenties - she looks
fairly mature (serious anyway) but still young.]
<lady:    douka KI o tsukete...>
lady: Please be carefull...
<lady:    KONDO koso CHICHIUE o SUKUtte kudasai.>
lady: I hope that chichi-ue can be saved this time.

(    "chichi-ue" is a respectful (and old-style) way to refer to your father.)

<Sango:    CHICHI-UE tte...>
Sango: "Chichi-ue"...
<Kagome:    oSHIRO no oHIME-sama?>

[Closeup of the lady.]
<lady:    IMA made NANNINmo no oBOU-sama ya MIKO-sama-tachi ga ONI-BARAi ni SHIPPAIshi,>

<lady:    INOCHI o Otoshi mashita.>
lady: and lost their lives.

2
[Closeup of Miroku looking earnest.]
<Miroku:    goANSHIN kudasai, HIME-sama.>
Miroku: Please do not worry, hime-sama.
Fx Miroku: *get close* <gui>

(    "hime-sama" can be used to address a princess or a noble lady.)

3
[Miroku is now sitting in front of the lady, staring up at here. Nearby,
Sango and Inuyasha look angry, while Kagome is taking it calmly.]
<Miroku:    kono WATASHI ga jikkuri to NANNICHImo kakete oHARAi o itashi masu.>
Miroku: I shall stay here however many days it takes to complete the purification.
Fx Miroku: *stare* <ji_>
<Sango:    sassa to katazukete, totto to KAEru n-desho_.>
Sango: Weren't you going to finish it off quickly and get back huh!?

4
[The group looks to the side at something off-scene.]
<voice#1:    ONI da--_.>
voice#1: {off} It's the Oni-i-i!
<voice#2:    ONI ga DEta zo--_.>
voice#2: {off} The Oni's come!

[Closeup of Inuyasha and Kagome looking surprised.]
<Inuyasha:    TSUkiNUketa?>
Inuyasha: It went through?

3
[Sango catches her boomerang.]
Sango: !?
Fx boomerang: *catch* <Pashi>

4
[Inuyasha rushes forwards, drawing Tetsusaiga.]
<Inuyasha:    chi_,>
Inuyasha: Damn,
<Inuyasha:    doite-ro SANGO.>

<Miroku:    ano ONI no KUBI moshiya...>
Miroku: .oO(Could it be that's Oni's Head is...).
