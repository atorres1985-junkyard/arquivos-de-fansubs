Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

Title: Vanished Presence

(    "Presence" in this case would be similar to "ability to sense the location
of" someone, eg Naraku.)

Kouga was holding.]

Miroku: You intend to use the wolves to do a blanket search huh.
<Inuyasha:    ke_, nani o IMA sara.>
Inuyasha: Bah, what's the point in that.

2
[Closeup of Inuyasha, eyes closed, turned away in derision.]
<Inuyasha:    OOKAMI-gotoki ni KAgitsukerareru kurai nara,>
Inuyasha: If those measly wolves could sniff him out,
<Inuyasha:    tokku no MUKASHI ni ore ga SAGAshiDAshite-ru ze.>
Inuyasha: I would have found him a long time ago.

3
[Inuyasha opens his eyes and is angry to find Kouga talking to Kagome.]
<Inuyasha:    tte, KIite-n no ka Kora!>
Inuyasha: Hey, are you listening to me!?
<Kouga:    kagome,>
Kouga: Kagome,
<Kouga:    ore wa mou Ikanakya naranee.>
Kouga: I have to go now.

4
[In a scene with a romantic background, Kouga clutches Kagome's hands. As
usual, Kagome looks like she's not interested.]
<Kouga:    KONDO Au TOKI wa, NARAKU no KUBI o TEmiyage ni MOtte kite yaru kara na.>
Kouga: The next time we meet, I shall bring you Naraku's head as a present.
Fx Kouga: (at Kagome) *stare* <ji_>
<Kagome:    irana-i.>

just stands there patiently.]

[Miroku comes over to Inuyasha, who responds angrily.]
<Miroku:    shikashi INUYASHA,>
Miroku: However Inuyasha,
<Miroku:    KOUGA no KAZU o TANOnda yariKATA wa YUUKOU kamo shiren zo.>
Miroku: relying on Kouga's numbers may be an effective way.
<Inuyasha:    AMAi ttsu tte n-da yo.>
Inuyasha: I'm saying that's naive.

[View of the remains of the hairy monster.]

2
[Closeup of Inuyasha speaking forcefully.]
<Inuyasha:    NIOi ga TEgakari ni naru tte n-nara, nande NARAKU wa koitsu o SUte-ta n-da!?>
Inuyasha: If his smell could be a clue, then why would Naraku throw him away!?
<Inuyasha:    konna NIOi no MOTO o yo!>
Inuyasha: He's the origin of this smell!
<Inuyasha:    BUYOUJIN sugiru ja nee ka!>
Inuyasha: Isn't that too careless for him!

3
[Miroku and Sango absorb this.]
<Miroku:    haa...>
Miroku: Oh...

4
[Closeup side view of Inuyasha.]
<Inuyasha:    tsumari NARAKU no YAROU wa ZETTAI MItsukaranee JISHIN ga aru tte koto da.>
Inuyasha: In other words, it means that that bastard Naraku is confident he'll never be found.
<Inuyasha:    sou ja nee ka!?>
Inuyasha: Right!?

[Miroku addresses Inuyasha, who has an annoyed look.]
<Miroku:    ICHIRI aru na.>

<Inuyasha:    e".>
Inuyasha: _Eh_.

<Miroku:    NARAKU wa doko ni Itta to OMOu?>
Miroku: Where do you think Naraku has gone?

3
[Inuyasha is glaring at Miroku while Kagome and Sango giving Inuyasha
slightly surprised looks.]
<Miroku:    omae no KANGAe o KIkasero.>

<Inuyasha:    ato wa omae ga KANGAero.>
Inuyasha: You think about the rest of it.
<Sango:    KANGAete nakatta n-da.>

[Closeup of Kagome thinking, looking a bit sad.]

[Kikyou is now walking along a river bank.]
<Kikyou:    tadoritsukenai...>
Kikyou: .oO(I can't manage to find...).
<Kikyou:    NARAKU no KEHAI ni.>
Kikyou: .oO(Naraku's presence.).

2
[View of some trees.]
<voice:    oi...>
voice: {off} Hey...
<voice:    soko no ONNA...>
voice: You woman over there...

3
[Kikyou turns to look to the side.]

4
[Near Kikyou is an old man in armour sitting against a tree.]
Fx Kikyou: shh... <Za...>

5
[Closeup of the old man. He has a scar across his right eye, has some armour
a in good condition and a sword. Either an old warrior or bandit. He looks
quite weak.]
<old man:    MIta tokoro omae...>
old man: You look like...
<old man:    SHINBUTSU ni TSUKAeru MI daro...>
old man: someone who wields divine power...

[View of the stars.]
<Inuyasha:    a-- chikushou mata Furidashi ka.>
Inuyasha: Ahhh, dammit, back to where we started.

2
[Inuyasha and Kagome are on a grassy slope, looking up at the stars - well,
Kagome is anyway.]
<Inuyasha:    sekkaku KEKKAI o KIreru you ni natta tte no ni yo-.>
Inuyasha: Just when I'd finally become able to cut the barrier too.
<Kagome:    un...>
Kagome: Yeah...
<Kagome:    dakedo...>
Kagome: However...

3
[Closeup of Kagome looking off into the distance.]
<Kagome:    NARAKU wa kitto MItsukeDAseru wa yo.>
Kagome: We'll surely find Naraku.
<Kagome:    minna de SAGAseba...>
Kagome: If everybody searches...

4
[Inuyasha suddenly sits up angrily.]
Fx Inuyasha: *sit up* <muku_>
<Inuyasha:    minna tte nanda yo.>
Inuyasha: Whadda ya mean "everybody"?
<Inuyasha:    omae yappa KOUGA o TAYOtte n-no ka?>
Inuyasha: You're relying on Kouga after all?
<Kagome:    e.>
Kagome: Eh.

5
[Closeup of Kagome. (from her reason she obviously wasn't thinking of Kouga)]
<Kagome:    nani yo.>
Kagome: What's this.
<Kagome:    mada YAite n-no?>
Kagome: Jealous again?



Page 16
1
[Inuyasha glares at Kagome, who looks back calmly.]
<Inuyasha:    ba_,>
Inuyasha: Bah,
<Inuyasha:    YAitenee_.>
Inuyasha: I'm not jealous!
<Kagome:    YAitenai n-da.>
Kagome: So you're not jealous.

2
[Inuyasha and Kagome look at each other. (this is basically a battle of
wills over the argument - who speaks first, loses)]
Fx scene: *comical silence* <shi--n>

3
[Inuyasha looks at Kagome a bit nervously, while Kagome responds with a
slightly annoyed accusing expression.]
<Inuyasha:    dou demo ii n-da yo sonna HANASHI.>
Inuyasha: Let's drop this conversation.
<Kagome:    mo-,>
Kagome: Sheesh,
<Kagome:    JIBUN de IiDAshi toite...>
Kagome: you brought it up in the first place...

4
[Kagome and Inuyasha now realise that Sango and Miroku (with Kirara and
Shippou sleeping on their laps) are sitting behind, watching.]
Fx Sango and Miroku: *sta-a-are...* <ji---...>
Fx Inuyasha: erk... <Giku...>

5
[View of the group.]
<Miroku:    kamawazu HANASHI o TSUZUkenasai.>
Miroku: Don't mind us, and continue your conversation.
Fx Shippou: snooze... <suka...>
<Inuyasha:    mou ii.>
Inuyasha: Enough already.
<Kagome:    yoka-nai wa yo.>
Kagome: I've had enough too.
Fx Kagome: *si-i-gh* <ha-->



Page 17

[Scene change. View of some forest covered hills in the day-time.]

2
[In the forest, two men look up (one middle-aged holding an axe, one old).]
<woodsman:    hee-,>
woodsman: Ooh,
<woodsman:    IHATSU o TODOke ni harubaru...>
woodsman: you've brought an "Ihatsu" all this way...

(    "Ihatsu" is "the hair of the deceased". I guess getting a lock of your hair
delivered instead of your body is cultural alternative. A warriors "mage"
(topknot of hair) is actually quite important and today in Japan you
sometimes see a big deal about having your hair get cut, sometimes as a
self-inflicted punishment, and sometimes as a way to get revenge on
someone. However, I guess in this case here, it's a way for the spirit to
go where the body can't.)

3
[Kikyou is talking to the woodsmen.]
<Kikyou:    imawa no kiwa no TANOmare GOTO deshita no de...>
Kikyou: It was the last request of a dying man...
<woodsman:    aa, HAKUREI-ZAN no oKIYOmeDOKORO no HANASHI wa KIita koto aru na.>
woodsman: Aah, I've heard of the story of the purification area on Mt Hakurei...

(    "hakurei" loosely translates as "white soul".)

4
[Closeup of Kikyou.]
<woodsman:    MUKASHI no ERA-i oBOUsama ga HIRAkareta TERA ga atte,>
woodsman: Long ago a _great_ Buddhist priest opened a temple there,
<woodsman:    soko ni MOUdereba, donna TSUMI mo KIYOmerareru to ka...>
woodsman: an if you visit the temple there, any sins can be purified...



Page 18

[Sometime later, Kikyou stands at the top of a hill looking over a valley to
a large rocky, tree covered mountain.]
Fx leaves: rustle... <Zaa...>

2
[Closeup of Kikyou.]
<Kikyou:    are ga HAKUREI-ZAN...ka.>
Kikyou: .oO(That's Mt Hakurei... huh.).
<Kikyou:    nanika... FUSHIGI na KAnji da...>
Kikyou: .oO(Something... feels strange...).
