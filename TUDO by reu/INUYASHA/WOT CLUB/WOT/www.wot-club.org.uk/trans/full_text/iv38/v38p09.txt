Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

<Inuyasha:    sore wa... dou iu koto da.>
Inuyasha: What do... you mean by that.
<Kikyou:    KARADA nado... NANDO KUDAitemo ONAji koto...>
Kikyou: No matter how often... you smash his body, it makes no difference...

[Nearby, Kohaku is looking on from behind a bush.]
Kohaku: ......

4
[Closeup side view of Kikyou.]
<Kikyou:    IKKOKU mo HAYAku SHIKON no TAMA o KANSEIsaseneba naranai.>
Kikyou: I have to complete the Shikon no Tama as soon as possible.



Page 9

[Closeup of Kohaku realising what this means.]

2
[View of Naraku with a complete Shikon no Tama in his hands.]
<Kikyou:    KIKAI wa ICHIDO...>
Kikyou: There will only be one chance...

3
[Closeup of Kikyou.]
<Kikyou:    NARAKU ga KANZENnaru SHIKON no TAMA o TE ni shita TOKI da.>
Kikyou: which is when Naraku has his hands on the complete Shikon no Tama.

[Inuyasha turns to see Kohaku arrive.]

Inuyasha: !



Page 14

[Closeup of Inuyasha.]
<Inuyasha:    KOHAKU...>
Inuyasha: Kohaku...

[Closeup of Kohaku.]

[View of Kohaku.]
<Inuyasha:    konna CHIKAku ni ite,>
Inuyasha: .oO(even though he's so close,).
<Inuyasha:    doushite ore wa KOHAKU no NIOi ni KI ga tsukanakatta!?>
Inuyasha: .oO(why didn't I notice Kohaku's smell!?).



Page 15
1
[View of Kohaku, slicing off a bit of his hair.]
Fx Kohaku: shh <Za_>

2
[View of Kohaku holding out a bit of his hair, tied up.]
<Kohaku:    KAMI o...>
Kohaku: This hair...

3
[Kohaku puts it on the ground.]
<Kohaku:    kore o ANE-UE ni...>
Kohaku: Please give it to ane-ue...
<Kohaku:    itsumo ISSHO ni iru to...>
Kohaku: Say that we'll always be together...

(    This is a bit hard to explain, but basically, Kohaku is leaving his hair as
a momento for Sango. This strongly implies he doesn't expect to see Sango
again (directly).)

4
[Inuyasha rushes forwards.]
Fx Inuyasha: *dash* <Da_>
<Inuyasha:    MAte KOHAKU.>
Inuyasha: Wait Kohaku.

5
[Inuyasha slams into a crackling barrier.]
Fx barrier: crackle crackle <Bachi Bachi Bachi>

[View of Inuyasha looking at Kohaku on the other side of the wavering barrier.]
<Inuyasha:    KEKKAI...>

Page 16

[Closeup of Inuyasha shouting.]
<Inuyasha:    KOHAKU omae...>

<Kohaku:    kakera ga...>
Kohaku: The fragment...
<Kohaku:    MICHIBIite kureru.>
Kohaku: will be guide me.

3
[Closeup of Kohaku, smiling.]
<Kohaku:    ore wa SHIni ni Iku n-ja nai...>
Kohaku: I'm not going to my death...
<Kohaku:    NARAKU o TAOsu tame ni Iku n-da.>
Kohaku: I'm going to defeat Naraku.

(    This sounds strange, but what I think Kohaku means is that his only concern
is to defeat Naraku, and anything else is secondary. Kohaku certainly
doesn't seem to expect he'll survive defeating Naraku.)



Page 17
1
[Kohaku runs off.]
Fx Kohaku: dash <Da_>
<Kohaku:    ANE-UE o TANOmi masu!>
Kohaku: Please take care of ane-ue!

<Inuyasha:    MAte KOHAKU!>
Inuyasha: Wait Kohaku!

[Inuyasha holds out Tetsusaiga, which is glowing darkly (red) and crackling
with energy.]

Inuyasha: .oO(Red Tetsusaiga!).
<Inuyasha:    KEKKAI o KIriSAke!>
Inuyasha: .oO(Tear down the barrier!).

<Inuyasha:    AKAi TETSUSAIGA ga hajikarete-ru!?>
Inuyasha: .oO(The barrier is repelling red Tetsusaiga!?).

3
[Inuyasha looks on at the barrier.]
Fx barrier: *stir of power...* <Zawa...>
<Inuyasha:    chikushou...>
Inuyasha: Dammit...

4
[View of the piece of Kohaku's hair.]
<Inuyasha:    KOHAKU...>
Inuyasha: .oO(Kohaku...).
