Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

Title: Orochi Nest

(    "Orochi" simply means "large snake". Though the legend of the "Yamata no
Orochi" is famous, there doesn't seem to be any other deep meaning behind
the word that I can find.)
