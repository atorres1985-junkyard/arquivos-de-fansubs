Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

[View of Kagome, Inuyasha and Toutousai, who's hiding behind Inuyasha.]
<Kagome:    yamete INUYASHA.>
Kagome: Don't do it, Inuyasha.
<Inuyasha:    sagatte-ro kagome.>
Inuyasha: Get back Kagome.
<Toutousai:    omee KAteru to OMOtte n-no ka?>
Toutousai: Do you think you can win?

2
[Closeup of Inuyasha.]
<Inuyasha:    ke_,>
Inuyasha: Bah!
<Inuyasha:    MAtte kure to Ittemo, KIku AITE ja nee daro.>
Inuyasha: He's not an opponent who'd listen, even if you said "please wait".

3
[View of Sesshoumaru, holding up Toukijin.]
Fx mist: swish... <Zawa...>
<Sesshoumaru:    sou iu koto da.>
Sesshoumaru: That's right.
<Sesshoumaru:    kakatte KOi, INUYASHA.>
Sesshoumaru: Come at me, Inuyasha.

[Sesshoumaru speeds in.]
<Sesshoumaru:    KOnai nara kochira kara yuku zo.>
Sesshoumaru: If you won't come, then I will.
Fx Sesshoumaru: vwish <Su_>

2
[Inuyasha charges forwards, drawing Tetsusaiga.]
Fx Inuyasha: swish <Za_>
Fx Tetsusaiga: shing <Sha_>
<Inuyasha:    ke_, KOUKAIsunna yo SESSHOUMARU!>

[Closeup of powered-up Tetsusaiga in Inuyasha's hands, which seems to drop.]
Fx Tetsusaiga: *massive weight* <Zushi>

4
[Closeup of Inuyasha gritting his teeth in pain/strain.]
<Inuyasha:    ku_,>
Inuyasha: .oO(Ugh.).
<Inuyasha:    nante OMOsa da.>
Inuyasha: .oO(It's so heavy.).



Page 5
1
[Inuyasha looks up to see Sesshoumaru aiming Toukijin at him.]
Fx Toukijin: whoosh <Go_>
Inuyasha: !

2
[Inuyasha manages to block with Tetsusaiga, but is pushed back -
Tetsusaiga's point is also digging into the ground, as it's too heavy for
Inuyasha to hold it up.]
Fx swords: clang <Ka_>
Fx Tetsusaiga: (cutting up ground) skrsh (<Za_>
<Inuyasha:    ku_,>
Inuyasha: Ugh!



Page 6
1
[Inuyasha is hit by lots of small cuts - like when fighting Kaijinbou, but stronger.]
Fx cuts: snick snick <Bishi Bishi>
Inuyasha: !

2
[Kagome, Shippou and Toutousai look on, worried.]
<Kagome:    yappari Ukeru no ga yatto da wa.>
Kagome: Like I thought, he can just manage to block.
<Shippou:    shikamo KENATSU ni MAketo-ru.
** given up on translating "kenatsu" directly, at the moment. See comment below.
>
Shippou: He even lost the "kenatsu" battle.
<Toutousai:    Mazui na mo~>
Toutousai: This is _ba~ad_.

(    I've translated "kenatsu" as "cutting-force" before, but I think I should
leave it untranslated for the moment, unless I think of a more appropiate
version. It seems to be a made-up word (or very rare) and literally means
"sword-force" or "sword-pressure". Both Tetsusaiga and Toukijin can cut
without even physically hitting - Tetsusaiga's top-end "kenatsu" being the
"Cutting Wind". Kaijinbou got cut apart by Tetsusaiga's "kenatsu" in the
previous chapter, and it also kept back Toukijin's "kenatsu" that time -
Inuyasha won that "kenatsu" battle.) 

3
[Miroku turns to Toutousai.]
<Miroku:    IMA no INUYASHA de wa KAchime wa nai to!?>
Miroku: Has Inuyasha now got no chance!?
<Toutousai:    da~tte, aitsu TETSUSAIGA FUrene- jan.>
Toutousai: We~e~ell, he can't swing Tetsusaiga.

4
[Closeup of Toutousai thinking.]
<Toutousai:    sore ni shitemo, tada de sae BUSSOU na TSURUGI TOUKIJIN...>
Toutousai: .oO(Besides, that inherently dangerous sword Toukijin...).
<Toutousai:    yori ni yotte SESSHOUMARU no TE ni WATAcchimau to wa...>
Toutousai: .oO(ended up in that hands of Sesshoumaru, of all people...).
