Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

wolf-man: {off} You're okay, Kouga!?
<Kouga:    _tarime- daro.>

[Kouga's two remaining friends are looking at Kouga in surprise.]
<wolf-man patch:    de, NARAKU o mitsuketa no ka?>

<Kouga:    a-.>
Kouga: Yeah.

3
[The wolf-man looks a bit surprised.]
wolf-man patch: ......

4
[The two wolf-men question Kouga.]
<wolf-man patch:    nande MODOtte kita n-da yo.>
wolf-man patch: Why did you come back then?
<wolf-man spike:    ...moshiya NIgete...?>
wolf-man spike: ...Could it be that you ran off...?
<Kouga:    fu_,>
Kouga: Humph.

5
[Kouga turns to look at his friends.]
<Kouga:    KAN yo.>
Kouga: Intuition.
<Kouga:    NARAKU wa tomokaku,>
Kouga: It wasn't Naraku,
<Kouga:    yatsu ga TSUrete-ta ATAMA no WARUso- na YAROU...>
Kouga: but rather, that seemingly stupid jerk he brought with him...



Page 11
1
[Closeup of Kouga making a point.]
<Kouga:    JUUROUMARU to ka itta ka...>
Kouga: Juuroumaru or whatever he was called...
<Kouga:    suge- Yabai KEHAI ga shita.>
Kouga: gave me the absolute creeps.
<Kouga:    ore no CHOKKAN ni MACHIGAinee.>
Kouga: My intuition is never wrong.

2
[Kouga gets up and looks off with a smirk.]
<Kouga:    he_, sono TEN INUYASHA wa Baka da ze.>
Kouga: Heh, on that point Inuyasha is a fool.
<Kouga:    IMAGORO JUUROUMARU ni gittagita ni yararete-ru ni CHIGAinee.>
Kouga: About now, he'll likely be being painfully done in by Juuroumaru.
<wolf-man patch:    INUYASHA ni Atta no ka?>
wolf-man patch: You met Inuyasha?

3
[The two wolf-men look a bit tentative and worried.]

<wolf-man patch:    YOKEI na koto kamo shirenee ga...>
wolf-man patch: This may be none of our business, but...
<wolf-man spike:    sore, INUYASHA to ISSHO ni iru kagome-NEE-san mo, ABUnee tte koto ja...>

[Comical moment of Kouga realising this.]

[Meanwhile, back in the forest...]
Fx sound of movement: {off} rustle... <Zawa...>

2
[Juuroumaru makes another strike at Inuyasha, again missing and smashing up
the ground.]

<Inuyasha:    ha_.>

3
[Again a flashing attack comes at Inuyasha's head.]
Fx attack: whoosh <Hyu_>

[Inuyasha throws up his arm, which gets cut. Juuroumaru seems to be using
his left arm for this, but again it's not clear.]

<Inuyasha:    ku_.>
Inuyasha: Ugh.

2
[Inuyasha angrily starts to draw Tetsusaiga.]
Fx Tetsusaiga: shing <Sha_>
<Inuyasha:    ko_,>
Inuyasha: Yo-,

3
[Inuyasha makes a powerful downwards cut with Tetsusaiga, seeming to cut
Juuroumaru's attack in half.]
<Inuyasha:    kono YAROU!>
Inuyasha: you bastard!
Fx Tetsusaiga: thud <Dan>
Fx attack: fwip <Ba_>



Page 14

[The end of Juuroumaru's arm, or whatever, flies into the bushes.]

2
[Kagome and Shippou look on.]
<Kagome:    yatta!>
Kagome: That got him!
<Shippou:    UDE o KIriOtoshita!?>
Shippou: He cut off the arm!?

3
[Inuyasha pauses to look at Juuroumaru.]
Fx Inuyasha: rustle... <Zawa...>

4
[Closeup side view of Inuyasha thinking, looking a bit strained.]
<Inuyasha:    dou iu koto da!?>
Inuyasha: .oO(What's going on!?).
<Inuyasha:    KItta KANSHOKU nanka nakatta zo.>
Inuyasha: .oO(There wasn't any feeling of cutting.).

5
[Black frame.]
<Inuyasha:    are wa...>
Inuyasha: .oO(_That thing_...).
<Inuyasha:    JUUROUMARU kara KATTE ni HANArete...?>
Inuyasha: .oO(separated from Juuroumaru of it's own accord...?).

6
[Juuroumaru makes another attack run.]
Fx Juuroumaru: swish <Za_>



Page 15
1
[Juuroumaru carves up the ground again.]
<Inuyasha:    ha_.>
Inuyasha: {dodging} Hah!
Fx ground: wham <Doga_>

2
[Closeup of Juuroumaru's arms and hands after making the crater in the
ground. Doesn't seem injured at all.]
Fx rocks: clatter... <Gara...>
Inuyasha: !

3
[Miroku, Kagome and Shippou look on in surprise.]
<Miroku:    a...?>
Miroku: Ah...?
<Shippou:    UDE ga tsuito-ru!?>
Shippou: The arms are still there!?



Page 16
1
[Closeup of Inuyasha looking surprised.]
<Inuyasha:    yappari... sakki no are wa...>
Inuyasha: .oO(I knew it... that thing earlier...).
<Inuyasha:    UDE nanka ja nee!>
Inuyasha: .oO(wasn't his arm!).

2
[Closeup of the ground just behind Inuyasha.]
Fx rocks: plock <Boko_>

3
[Like one of the fast attacks earlier, something small and sharp blasts out
of the rocks behind Inuyasha and shoots right through his chest, coming out
the other side.]
Fx attacking thing: vfwip <Ba_>
Fx Inuyasha: *stab* <Do_>
Inuyasha: !



Page 17
1
[Miroku, Kagome and Shippou are shocked and worried.]
<Miroku:    na...>
Miroku: Wha...
<Miroku:    JIMEN kara!?>
Miroku: From the ground!?
<Kagome:    i, INUYASHA-_.>
Kagome: I, Inuyasha-a!

2
[Inuyasha falls to his knees, looking over at Juuroumaru, where the thing lands.]
Fx Inuyasha: *loose strength...* <Gaku...>
<Inuyasha:    ku...>
Inuyasha: Ugh...
Fx thing: (landing) thock <Bo_>

3
[Closeup of whatever it is. It's not clear in this frame, but it's body is
snake/tentacle like (doesn't have scales though), and the head has a mop of
long white hair (like Juuroumaru, though the face can't be seen). Just
behind the head are two large pincers (like a preying mantis) both dripping
with blood. This is clearly the thing that originally attacked Naraku and
the guards.]
Fx thing: *slither...* <Mozo...>

4
[Miroku, Kagome and Sango look on in surprise.]
<Miroku:    na...>
Miroku: Wha...
<Sango:    nanda are wa!?>
Sango: What's that!?



Page 18
1
[Closeup of the little monster. It's face looks like Juuroumaru's, but is a
lot meaner and has a nasty smile.]
<youkai:    kukuku...>
youkai: Kukuku...
Fx youkai: *slide...* <Zu...>

(    This new Youkai, even though it's quite small, has the same kind of
monsterous/evil voice that Goshinki had.)

2
[The new Youkai raises itself up on it's coiled body, smiling nastily.
Juuroumaru, behind it, looks as passive as always.]
<youkai:    aitsu no HARAWATA... nakanaka ii AJI da ze, JUUROUMARU.>
youkai: That guy's guts... taste pretty nice, Juuroumaru.
Fx youkai: *slimey...* <Nuru...>

3
[Closeup of Inuyasha looking shocked.]
<Inuyasha:    chi... chikushou.>
Inuyasha: .oO(Da... dammit.).
<Inuyasha:    mou IPPIKI iyagatta no ka.>
Inuyasha: .oO(There's another fucking one.).
