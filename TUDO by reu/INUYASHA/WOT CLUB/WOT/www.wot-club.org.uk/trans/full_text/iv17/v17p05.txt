Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

Myouga: Until you promise, I won't stop!
<Myouga:    NIDO to TETSUSAIGA o HOUriDAshite wa nari masen_.>
Myouga: You mustn't neglect using Tetsusaiga again!
<Inuyasha:    ke_.>
Inuyasha: Bah!

2
[Inuyasha is sitting near the edge of a rock overhanging the river. Kagome
is sitting next to him, and Miroku is a bit behind Kagome.]
Fx waterfall: slsh-slsh... <Zazaza...>
<Miroku:    ke_, ja nai desho-.>
Miroku: You don't mean that, surely.
<Kagome:    chotto wa OMOi kamo shirenai kedo...>
Kagome: Maybe it's a little heavy, but...
<Inuyasha:    chotto da too!?>
Inuyasha: A _little_!?

3
[Inuyasha starts to draw out Tetsusaiga.]
<Inuyasha:    temee-ra KANTAN ni Iu kedo na_...>
Inuyasha: You lot say it so easily, but...
Fx Tetsusaiga: shing <Sha_>

[Inuyasha, who has Tetsusaiga held out over to his right (above the water)
is pulled over the edge of the ledge by the weight.]
Fx Tetsusaiga: *massive weight* <Zushi>
Fx stones: clatter... <gura...>

2
[Kagome turns to Miroku as Inuyasha hits the water in the background.]
Fx Inuyasha: {comically} ka-splash <dobo-n>
<Miroku:    dou OMOware masu? kagome-SAMA.>
Miroku: What do you think, Kagome-sama?
<Kagome:    e...?>
Kagome: Eh...?

3
[Closeup of Miroku.]
<Miroku:    WATASHI wa...>
Miroku: I think...
<Miroku:    INUYASHA ni SHINJITSU o TSUTAeru beki da to OMOi masu.>
Miroku: we should tell Inuyasha the truth.

4
[Closeup of Kagome, looking a little sad.]
<Kagome:    SHINJITSU...>
Kagome: .oO(The truth...).
<Kagome:    TETSUSAIGA ga...>
Kagome: That Tetsusaiga...
<Kagome:    INUYASHA no YOUKAI no CHI o FUUjiKOmeru KATANA datte koto...?>
Kagome: is a sword sealing in Inuyasha's Youkai blood, you mean...?

[View of Miroku.]
<Miroku:    SHIranai kara KANTAN ni TEBANAshite shimau.>
Miroku: He gave up on it easily because he doesn't know.

2
[Closeup side view of Kagome thinking, with a drawing of Inuyasha from the
previous chapter - when it looked like he was about to become a Youkai again.]
<Kagome:    un...>
Kagome: Yeah...
<Kagome:    ano TOKI mo... SESSHOUMARU o TAOsou to shite,>
Kagome: .oO(At that time... to beat Sesshoumaru,).
<Kagome:    HENGEshikakete ita.>
Kagome: .oO(he started transforming again.).

3
[Myouga is bouncing angrily on Miroku's shoulder.]
<Myouga:    TSUTAecha nara-n.>
Myouga: You mustn't tell.
<Miroku:    MYOUGA-sama.>
Miroku: Myouga-sama.

4
[Closeup of Myouga looking worried.]
<Myouga:    INUYASHA-sama no koto ja,>
Myouga: If Inuyasha-sama knew that secret,
<Myouga:    HIMITSU o SHIttara, KATANA nanzo ni TAYOru yori, HENGEshita ONORE no TSUME to KIBA de TATAKAou to suru ni KImatto-ru.>
Myouga: he would decide to transform and fight with his own claws and fangs, rather than rely on some sword.

5
[Miroku considers this, and Kagome looks a little sad.]
<Miroku:    haa...>
Miroku: I see...
<Miroku:    yappari Kuse ni nari-masu ka naa.>
Miroku: It would become a habit after all I guess.
<Myouga:    naru_.>
Myouga: It would!
Kagome: ......

[A bit down-river, Toutousai is dumping Hiraikotsu into the water (which is
steaming), looking at Inuyasha who is wringing out his clothes.]
Fx water: sizzle... <Ju---...>
<Toutousai:    shikkashi omae mo ISOGAshii OTOKO da na.>
Toutousai: You really have your hands full.
<Toutousai:    HITO ni nattari Bakemono ni mo naru tte yu- ja nee ka.>
Toutousai: You're turning human, then also turning into a monster, aren't you.
<Inuyasha:    Bakemon te yuu na_!>
Inuyasha: Don't call me a monster!
Fx Inuyasha: (clothes) *wring* <giu~>

2
[Closeup of Inuyasha looking a bit fed-up.]
<Inuyasha:    ore datte Wake wakannee n-dakara yo_.>
Inuyasha: Even I don't understand why it happens!

3
[Closeup of Toutousai looking off at Inuyasha.]
<Toutousai:    wakannee no ka.>
Toutousai: You don't understand huh.
<Toutousai:    Baka da na omae.>
Toutousai: You're an idiot, you know.

4
[Miroku and Kagome look a bit apprehensive.]
<Miroku:    TOUTOUSAI-sama...>
Miroku: .oO(Toutousai-sama...).
<Kagome:    nani o IuKI!?>
Kagome: .oO(What's he going to say!?).

5
[Closeup of Toutousai.]
<Toutousai:    MYOUGA ni KIita ze.>
Toutousai: I heard it from Myouga.
<Toutousai:    omee SHInisou ni naru to BAkeru n-datte yo.>
Toutousai: That when it looks like you'll die, you transform.
<Toutousai:    ma, motomo to HANBUN wa YOUKAI no CHI ga NAGArete _kara na.>
Toutousai: Well, by nature half of your blood is Youkai after all.

[Closeup side view of Toutousai.]
<Toutousai:    mottomo ore ni Iwaserya.>
Toutousai: Here is my own theory though.

2
[Closeup of Inuyasha, suddenly paying attention seriously.]
<Toutousai:    sonna no HONTOU no TSUYOsa ja nee.>
Toutousai: {off} [Transforming into a Youkai] isn't real strength.
Fx Inuyasha: *twitch* <Piku>

3
[Toutousai continues to look at Inuyasha.]
<Toutousai:    INUYASHA yo,>
Toutousai: Inuyasha,
<Toutousai:    sono TETSUSAIGA no OMOsa wa, Itta toori omae no KIBA no OMOsa da.>
Toutousai: as I said, Tetsusaiga's weight is because of your fang's weight.

4
[Closeup of Inuyasha.]
<Toutousai:    Oreru MAE no TETSUSAIGA wa, omae no oyaji-dono no KIBA.>
Toutousai: {off} Before Tetsusaiga broke, it was your oyaji-dono's fang.
<Toutousai:    YOUsuru ni, omae wa oyaji-dono ni TAYOtte MAMOrarete-ta n-da.>
Toutousai: In short, you were relying on your oyaji-dono to protect you.

[Closeup of Toutousai.]
<Toutousai:    daga KONDO no TETSUSAIGA wa sou wa ikanee.>
Toutousai: However, this time Tetsusaiga isn't like that.
<Toutousai:    omae wa JIBUN no KIBA o TSUKAikonashite JIBUN o MAMOru n-da.>
Toutousai: You're handling your own fang, and protecting yourself.

2
[Closeup of Inuyasha, somewhere between surprised and impressed.]
<Toutousai:    sono TETSUSAIGA o JIYUU ni FUreru you ni natta TOKI--->
Toutousai: {off} When you can freely swing Tetsusaiga as it is now...
<Toutousai:    HONTOU ni omae wa TSUYOku nareru tte koto da.>
Toutousai: it means you'll have truely become strong.



Page 9

[Miroku is applauding Toutousai, and Kagome is looking quite happy, hands
gripped, looking encourgingly at Inuyasha, who is inching away from her in surprise.]
Fx Miroku: clap clap clap <Pachi Pachi Pachi>
<Miroku:    TOUTOUSAI-sama no ossharu toori.>
Miroku: It's just as you say, Toutousai-sama.
<Kagome:    ganbatte INUYASHA.>
Kagome: Keep at it Inuyasha.
Inuyasha: ......

2
[Closeup of Kagome looking happy, smiling widely. (She'd make a good cheerleader...)]
<Kagome:    INUYASHA wa TSUYOi n-da mono.>
Kagome: You are strong, Inuyasha.
<Kagome:    yaruKI ni nareba nanda tte yareru yo ne_.>
Kagome: You could do anything if you set your mind to it, for sure!

3
[Closeup of Inuyasha edging away, a bit at a loss as how to respond.]
