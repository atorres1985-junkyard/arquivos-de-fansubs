Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

Title: The Fourth One

fourth offspring that Naraku has made.)

Kagura: .oO(Humph... That jerk Naraku, he's given birth to another fucking weird thing.).

(    Kagura's language is consistently quite impolite for a woman - rather like
a man's rough speech in some ways.)

<wolf-man:    KOUGA! kyou to iu kyou wa, Iwasete morau ze.>
wolf-man: {off} Kouga! Today's the day I'll tell you!

(    This wolf-man (can't tell who) is obviously frustrated, and has been
meaning to say something for a long time. Despite this, the line still
indicates humbleness/subserviance to Kouga.)

[Closeup of Kouga, glaring off.]
<Kouga:    nandei.>
Kouga: Say what.
Fx Kouga: *glare* <Giro>

4

of hair, and the wolf-man with spiked hair, looks rather fearful and taken

turn their heads around.]

<Inuyasha:    n!?>

grin, while digging the ground up somewhat.]

<Inuyasha:    nan no YOU dei, YAseOOKAMI.>
Inuyasha: Whadda you want, wimpy wolf.
<Kouga:    n~~?>
Kouga: Hn~n~n~n?

[Kagome talks to Inuyasha, looking a bit worried, but he's just watching Kouga.]
<Kagome:    INUYASHA, ikinari Kenka wa Dame yo.>
Kagome: Inuyasha, don't start a fight so suddenly.
<Inuyasha:    urusee.>
Inuyasha: {to Kagome} Shuddup.
<Inuyasha:    NAGAre ni yotte wa KOROsu.>

<Kouga:    kagome, konna YAROU to ISSHO ni ite TSUKArene- ka?>
Kouga: Kagome, aren't you tired of being with this jerk?

2
[Kagome looks a bit annoyed, Inuyasha is really irritated and puts his hand
on Tetsusaiga's hilt, while Shippou suddenly shows up on Inuyasha's
shoulder, looking angry.]
<Kagome:    chotto...>
Kagome: Just a sec...

[Closeup of Shippou, speaking angrily.]
<Shippou:    INUYASHA wa omae ni kagome o UBAwareru to OMOtte, asetto-ru dake ja_.>
Shippou: Inuyasha's only upset because he remebers you stole Kagome!
<Shippou:    ittsumo konna da to OMOttara, OOMACHIGAi ja zo.>
Shippou: You're making a big mistake if you think he's _always_ like this.

(    Shippou's line is also somewhat implies "... you stole Kagome's heart!".)

4
[Inuyasha has angrily bopped Shippou on the head, Kagome is looking tiredly,
and Kouga is watching with arms holded.]

2
[Inuyasha, Kagome, Sango, Miroku etc are sitting on a group of rocks looking
at Kouga a short distance in front of them, also sitting on a rock. Kouga's
friends are a bit behind him.]
<Inuyasha:    Baka ka temee-ra,>
Inuyasha: You stupid bastards,
<Inuyasha:    sore ga wakarya, KUROU wa shinee n-da yo_.>
Inuyasha: if we knew that, we wouldn't be in so much difficulty.
<Kouga:    SHIrane- no ka yo_.>
Kouga: So you don't know then.

3
[Closeup of Inuyasha.]
<Inuyasha:    NARAKU no YAROU, SHIRO no mawari ni KEKKAI harimegurashite yagaru n-da.>
Inuyasha: That jerk Naraku has put up a barrier all around his fucking castle.
<Inuyasha:    NAKAMA no ADAUchi wa ore-tachi ni makasete...>
Inuyasha: We'll take care of your friends' vengeance, and...

4
[Inuyasha charges forwards, starting to draw Tetsusaiga.]

[Shippou and Miroku watch calmly.]
<Shippou:    mada TETSUSAIGA ga OMOi n-ja na.>

<Miroku:    sorya, Ikinari KARUku wa naran deshou.>
Miroku: Well, it wouldn't become light quickly, would it.

2
[Inuyasha shouts at Kouga.]

<Kagome:    mou chotto YASAshiku shite kuretemo...>
Kagome: .oO(if only he could be a bit more gentle about it...).

4
[Kagome turns away from Inuyasha, looking tired, but Inuyasha suddenly looks
rather comically shocked. He even has the first and fourth fingers on his
left hand extended pose, which was pretty common in Ranma 1/2, but we'd
hardly ever seen in the Inuyasha series. ]

3
[Kouga's view of some trees as he approaches the bottom.]
Fx Kouga: swish-swish <Zazaza>
<Kouga:    MACHIGAinee!!>
Kouga: There's no mistake!

4
[Kouga skids to a stop on a path. A short distance in front of him is (a)
Naraku in the standard baboon-pelt, riding on a horse, pulling a cart.]
Fx Kouga: (ground) skrsh <Za_>
Fx cart: creak... <Gishi...>

5
[Closeup of the cart and Naraku. The horse is actually a skeleton. On the
cart is a large box/crate with the walls made of some fabric. There's a

4
[View of part of the fabric surrounding the crate being pulled away, showing
one bright eye. Actually the crate seems more like a cage... Overlain,
Kouga looks a bit surprised.]
