Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

Title: Juuroumaru

(    Juuroumaru is a name - "juu" = beast, "rou" is often used in boy's names,
and "maru" is the same as for Sesshoumaru, which is often used as a name
ending, taken on by young men, before they become adults/settle down.)

[Closeup of Kouga.]
<Kouga:    he_,>
Kouga: Heh!
<Kouga:    nani HAKOnde KIta ka SHIranee ga,>
Kouga: I dunno what you've carted in, but,
<Kouga:    koko de Atta ga HYAKUNENme da.>
Kouga: I'll make use of this chance [to kill you].

2
[Kouga looks over at Naraku, standing beside the cart.]
<Kouga:    NARAKU,>
Kouga: Naraku,
<Kouga:    NAKAMA no KATAKI torasete morau ze.>
Kouga: I'm going to get revenge for my friends' deaths.
<Naraku:    kukuku KOUGA yo...>
Naraku: Kukuku. Kouga...

3
[The cover surrounding the box on the cart is pulled off, showing the top of
a cage.]
<Naraku:    kisama no AITE wa koitsu da.>
Naraku: {off} your opponent is this guy.
Fx cover: flap... <Basa...>

[Closeup side view of Kouga looking a bit surprised.]
<Kouga:    ORI!?>
Kouga: .oO(A cage!?).

2
[View of the cage with something dark lurking inside, as the door is lifted up.]
Fx cage: squeek... <Gi...>
Fx creature: rasp... <Shu-->

[Closeup of Naraku.]
<Naraku:    DEte KOi JUUROUMARU.>
Naraku: Come out, Juuroumaru.

[Closeup of part of a bare human looking hand peeking out from a rich
looking sleeve, but with a thick chain wrapped around it.]
Fx chains: chang... <Jara...>

1
[Closeup of Juuroumaru's face - what we can see of him anyway, as he has a
mask (a bit like Sango's) over his face. As a whole, he looks vaguely like
Inuyasha, though is certainly different - he has long white (in blank &
white anyway) hair, but it's straighter and plainer than Inuyasha. His eyes
are almost vacant looking, but look human.]
Fx Juuroumaru: rasp... <Shu--...>

2
[Full view of Juuroumaru, now that he's outside the cage. He's dressed in a
rather fine kimono, but has his hands in manacles with a thick chain going
all around him. Like Inuyasha, he wears no shoes or similar, but he looks
much more like a human.]
Fx Juuroumaru: *slide...* <Zu...>
Fx chains: chang...  <Jara...>

[Kouga looks on a bit surprised.]

[Juuroumaru is crouched on the ground, faces Kouga.]

3
[Closeup of Kouga, as he angrily looks off at Naraku.]
<Kouga:    doushita NARAKU.>
Kouga: What's the meaning of this, Naraku.
<Kouga:    sassa to soitsu no KUTSUWA to KUSARI o hazushi yagare.>
Kouga: Hurry up and fucking remove that guy's chain and halter.

(    Kouga actually says "bit" (as in "the bit in the mouth of a horse") but
that sounds kinda weird.)

4
[Side view of Naraku.]
<Naraku:    kisama ni wa, kono mama de juubun...>
Naraku: Like this will be sufficient again you, arsehole...

5
[Kouga rushes in for the attack.]
<Kouga:    sou ka yo.>
Kouga: Whatever.
Fx Kouga: swish <Za_>
<Kouga:    sore ja ENRYOnaku iku ze!>
Kouga: Then I'll attack without hesitation!

smashes apart two tree trunks with his arms.]
