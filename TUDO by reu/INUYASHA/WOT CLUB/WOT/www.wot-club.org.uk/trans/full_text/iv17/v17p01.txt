Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

Title: Toukijin

(    "Toukijin" is the name of the sword, and the kanji ("tou-ki-jin") loosely
translates as "fighting-Oni-god" (or "fighting-fierce-god").)

[Closeup of Jaken, looking a bit confused.]
<Jaken:    are...?>
Jaken: Huh...?
<Jaken:    washi wa TASHIka KAIJINBOU ni KIrarete...>
Jaken: I'm sure I was cut by Kaijinbou...

7
[Jaken sees the bottom half of his body in front of him, still seperated,
and has tears in his eyes.]
<Jaken:    tte yappashi...>
Jaken: hey, I did...!

8
[Black frame.]
<Sesshoumaru:    Iku zo JAKEN.>
Sesshoumaru: {off} Let's go Jaken.
<Sesshoumaru:    sassato KARADA o kuttsukero.>
Sesshoumaru: Hurry up and attach your body together.

[Jaken looks up at Sesshoumaru who has turned to leave.]
<Jaken:    ...SESSHOUMARU-sama...?>
Jaken: ...Sesshoumaru-sama...?

2
[Closeup of Jaken.]
<Jaken:    anou~ moshiya...>
Jaken: Ummm, could it be...
<Jaken:    TENSEIGA de washi no INOCHI o SUKUtte kudasatta no de...?>
Jaken: that you saved my life with Tenseiga...?

3
[Closeup side view of Jaken.]
<Sesshoumaru:    WATASHI no hoka ni, konna KOTO no dekiru MONO ga iru ka.>
Sesshoumaru: Apart from me, is there anyone else who can do that, huh?

4
[Jaken seems to have gotten his body back together and is looking at
Sesshoumaru with tears in his eye. (It kinda seems like Tenseiga will
repair very serious injuries and can even bring seperated body parts
together. Rather like what the full Shikon no Tama can do, though Tenseiga
seems a bit slower.)]
<Jaken:    SESSHOUMARU-sama...>
Jaken: Sesshoumaru-sama...
Fx Jaken: *be moved deeply...* <ji~~n>
<Jaken:    chotto KANDOU.>
Jaken: .oO(I'm quite deeply moved.).
<Sesshoumaru:    KAIJINBOU wa KATANA o SHIAgeta no ka?>
Sesshoumaru: Did Kaijinbou finish the sword?

5
[View of Jaken, having stood up.]
<Jaken:    so, sou deshita.>
Jaken: Th, that's right.
<Jaken:    KAIJINBOU wa ONI no KIBA kara TSURUGI o UchiOkoshita to...>
Jaken: Kaijinbou forged a sword from the Oni's fangs...

(    Sesshoumaru more literally says "Did Kaijinbou finish the 'katana'", and
Jaken says "Kaijinbou forged a 'tsurugi' from the Oni's fangs". "Katana" is
quite general, though can also mean "blade" (in the Japanese style).
"Tsurugi" is perhaps more general though older, and Jaken is implying that
the new sword is a two-edged sword - in full this would be "moroha no
tsurugi". There are lots of words in Japanese that mean "sword" or "blade"
in some way, or a particular make or style of sword. Two-edged swords
became rare a few centuries before the Sengoku Jidai - after making Katana
was perfected.)

[Closeup of Sesshoumaru who turns slightly back to look back at Jaken.]
<Jaken:    sore ga, ayatsu naniyara MEtsuki ga okashikute...>
Jaken: {off} Also, for some reason he looked strange, and...
<Jaken:    marude...>
Jaken: it's as if...

<Inuyasha:    chikushou...>
Inuyasha: .oO(Dammit...).

4
[View of the campsite - Inuyasha is sitting with his back against a rock
looking up. To his left is Miroku, who seems to be asleep while sitting up.
On the other side of the fire from Inuyasha is Sango, asleep on the ground
with Kirara. To Inuyasha's right Kagome is (mostly) in her sleeping-bag
with Shippou in her arms.]
<Inuyasha:    YORU ga NAGAi...>
Inuyasha: .oO(The night is long...).

5
[While in his same sleeping pose, Miroku talks.]
<Miroku:    INUYASHA, SUKOshi NEMUttara dou desu.>
Miroku: Inuyasha, how about sleeping a bit.
<Inuyasha:    MIROKU...>
Inuyasha: Miroku...

[View of Inuyasha turning away, looking annoyed.]
<Inuyasha:    ke_, hottoite kure.>

<Inuyasha:    ore wa HITO no SUGATA o shite-ru TOKI ni, NEMUtta koto wa nai n-dei.>
Inuyasha: When I have a human appearance, I don't sleep.

2
[Miroku gives Inuyasha a look, and Inuyasha gets annoyed.]
<Miroku:    kowakute NEMUren no ka?>
Miroku: Too scared to sleep huh?
<Inuyasha:    na"_...>
Inuyasha: _Wha_...

3
[Inuyasha looks away.]
<Inuyasha:    fu_...>
Inuyasha: Humph...

4
[Inuyasha turns back to glare at Miroku.]
<Inuyasha:    ou KOEe yo, WARIi ka.>
Inuyasha: So I'm scared, well excuse _me_.
<Miroku:    SUNAO de yoroshii.>
Miroku: At least you're honest.

5
[Closeup of Inuyasha looking more serious.]
<Inuyasha:    koredemo iroiro URAmarete_ kara na.>
Inuyasha: After all, there's all sorts who hate me.
<Inuyasha:    konna TOKI ni OSOwaretara, hito tamari mo ne- daro ga.>
Inuyasha: If I was attacked at a time like this, I'd be helpless wouldn't I.

6
[Miroku is looking off at something, seeming serious.]
<Miroku:    maa... ii KOKOROgake kamo shiremasen na.>
Miroku: Well... maybe that is worthwhile after all.
<Inuyasha:    n...?>
Inuyasha: Hm...?

7
[Sango has her eyes open, and Kirara is alert too.]
<Sango:    HOUSHI-sama... KIzuite-ru?>
Sango: Houshi-sama... you noticed?
<Miroku:    SANGO...>
Miroku: Sango...

8
[Sango sits up.]
<Sango:    hidoi JAKI da.>

Kaijinbou: Gugugu...
<Kaijinbou:    INUYASHA... doko ni iru...?>
Kaijinbou: Inuyasha... where are you...?

(    "Gugugu" is a rather monstrous chuckle. I was doing this as _kukuku_
before, but this was a mistake. Goshinki used this chuckle.)



Page 9

[The group are rather shocked by this.]
Fx group: shh <Za_>
Miroku: !?

Kaijinbou: The sacred sword I forged, "Toukijin"...
<Kaijinbou:    koitsu ga INUYASHA no CHI o SUitai to NAite oru wa...>

[Kaijinbou is pointing the sword right at Inuyasha.]
<Kaijinbou:    nandee... YOUKAI da to OMOtte itara...>

[Closeup of Miroku thinking.]

<Miroku:    IYOU na JAKI ni mamirete iru...>
Miroku: .oO(It's covered with a bizarre evil aura...).

[Off-scene, Kaijinbou continues, surprising Inuyasha and Miroku.]
<Kaijinbou:    gugugu... kono TOUKIJIN wa na...>

<Kaijinbou:    TOUTOUSAI no jijii ga KITAeta KATANA TETSUSAIGA o, KAmiKUDAita ONI no KIBA kara UchiOkoshita no yo.>
Kaijinbou: was forged from the Oni's fangs that bit apart the sword Tetsusaiga, made by that old fart Toutousai.



Page 12

<Inuyasha:    nan ni shita tte roku demo nee.>

3
[The two pieces of Hiraikotsu fall to the ground.]
Fx pieces: *fall with a thud* <Dosha>
<Kaijinbou:    gugugu... MUDA da.>

Kagome: .oO(You'd think Miroku-sama had no tricks up his sleeve other than the Air Rip, but he does have his Buddhist powers too.).

(    Kagome is actually addressing the readers with this - ie reminding us that
Miroku doesn't just have the Air Rip.)
