Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

[Inuyasha is angrily pointing Tetsusaiga up at Abi, up in the air. Around
them the village is burning.]
Fx flames: roa-a-a-r <Go--->
Fx flames: cracle crackle <Bachi Bachi...>
<Inuyasha:    ONNA o tata_KIru no wa SHUMI ja nee kedo na.>
Inuyasha: Ripping apart women ain't my style you know, but...
<Inuyasha:    temee wa Tachi ga WARUsugiru ze!>
Inuyasha: you're just too nasty!
<Abi:    fu_...>
Abi: Heh...

2
[Closeup of Abi.]
<Abi:    tata_KIru da tte!?>
Abi: Rip me apart!?
<Abi:    WARAwaseru n-ja nai yo.>
Abi: Don't make me laugh.

[Closeup side view of Abi.]
<Abi:    omae mo NARAKU to OANji...>
Abi: You're the same as Naraku...
<Abi:    HANYO darou!>
Abi: A Half-Youkai!

2
[Abi swings her taloned arm, unleashing some flame.]
<Abi:    HANYOU DOUSHI no kudaranai KOZEriAI ni...>
Abi: How dare you drag the great Abi-hime...
<Abi:    yokumo kono ABI-HIME-SAMA o MAkikonde kureta na!>
Abi: into a petty little fight between two Half-Youkai!
Fx flames: roa-a-ar <Go_>

(    "Abi-hime" is how Abi is generally called (and how she refers to herself).
"Hime" often means "princess" but can mean "lady". There doesn't seem to be
any obvious reason why she is called Abi-hime except that she seems at a
higher level than most Youkai - possibly from a well known family.)

<Abi:    yatsu-ra no CHI o SUitsukuse!>
Abi: Suck up all their blood!

2
[The birds swoop down to attack.]
Fx birds: swish <Za_>

3
[Inuyasha swings round Tetsusaiga, unleashing a lot of energy.]
<Inuyasha:    KAZE no KIZU!!>
Inuyasha: Kaze no Kizu!! (Cutting Wind)
Fx wind: whoosh <Go_>

Abi: This three-pronged halberd...
<Abi:    KEKKAI o HAtta...?>
Abi: erected a barrier...?

[Inside the house, the gang are sitting in a circle.]
<Sango:    aitsu... NARAKU ni KAKAwari wa aru rashii kedo...>
Sango: She... seems to have some kind of connection with Naraku, but...
<Sango:    TESAKI tte KANji ja nakatta ne.>
Sango: it didn't feel like she was an agent of his.

7
[View of Miroku and Inuyasha.]
<Miroku:    NARAKU no koto desu.>
Miroku: With regards to Naraku...
<Miroku:    ABI-HIME to yara o RIYOUshiyou to shite iru no deshou.>
Miroku: He's probably trying to use this Abi-hime person.
<Inuyasha:    nan no tame ni da.>
