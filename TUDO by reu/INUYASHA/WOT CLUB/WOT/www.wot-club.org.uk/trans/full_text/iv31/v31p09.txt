Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

<Title:    KINIKI no YAMA>
Title: The Forbidden Mountain

(    The title of this week's chapter is "kiniki no yama", but I can't find out
exactly what the word "kiniki" means anywhere (I even did a search with
Google). It has the kanji characters "forbidden" and "area", but the word
itself might have a more refined meaning.)
