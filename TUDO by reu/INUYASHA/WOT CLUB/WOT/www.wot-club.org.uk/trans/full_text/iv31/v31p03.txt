Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

[View of Sango and Miroku.]
<Sango:    demo, SHIKON no kakera ga aru tte koto ga hakkiri shita n-dakara,>

<Sango:    mattaku no MUDASHI ja nakatta tte koto da yo.>

[View of Inuyasha.]
<Inuyasha:    aa.>

[Scene change. View of the moon at night]
Fx ground: rumble... <Gooo...>

[Closeup of a burning village. There's some dead villages amoung the remains
of the houses.]
Fx flames: ro-a-a-r <Go--->
Fx wood: crackle crackle <Bachi Bachi Bachi>

3
[View of some bandits, in crude armour, with some on horse-back.]
Fx horse: clop clop <Dodo_>
<bandit#1:    chi_ shiketa MURA da ze.>
bandit#1: Damn, what a poor village.
<bandit leader:    KOME mo SAKE mo arya shinee.>
bandit leader: There's no rice or booze.

4
[View of the bandits.]
<bandit#1:    KOROshiZON ka yo.>
bandit#1: A pointless kill huh.
<bandit leader:    YAROU-domo HIkiageta.>

[Closeup of what's coming closer - it's a flock of birds. Well, more like
birds that were around when dinosaurs were still alive.]
Fx birds: swish... <Za--->

<bandit:    TORI...?>
bandit: Birds...?

3
[The birds decend onto the bandits, attack them - stabbing their beaks into
the necks.]

3
[Dark frame.]
<Voice:    TORI-TSUKAi no HIME...>
Voice: {off} The falconry princess...
<Voice:    ABI.>
Voice: Abi.

(    I translated "tori-tsukai" are "falconry" here, since that sounds better
than "bird-using", which is the literal translation. The kanji is slightly
different, but it seems "Abi" is a type of bird - "red-throated diver" also
known as a "red-throated loon".)

Fx Naraku: shh <Zaa...>

launch an evil plan").]

<Naraku:    watashi no tame MICHI o TSUKUre.>
Naraku: Make a path for me.
