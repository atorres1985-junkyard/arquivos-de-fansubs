Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

<Kagome:    HAKUDOUSHI no CHIKARA ja, sono MON wa TOOrenai tte koto kashira.>
Kagome: I wonder if this means Hakudoushi's power isn't enough to pass through the gateway.

[View ahead - a large number of barren mountains, with smoke coming from the
top and around them. Volcanos.]

<Kagura:    sou iu toko wa, NARAKU ni sokkuri da na.>

formation - Shippou and Kagome on Inuyasha's back, and Miroku and Sango on Kirara.]

shape of an oval. It's fairly plain but there's a thick chain around it.
Either side of the gateway is a large statue, each as tall as the gateway.
They're quite humanoid for the most part and are also carrying large weapons.]

<Inuyasha:    aa!? HASHIRA no KAZAri ja nakatta no ka yo.>
Inuyasha: Huh!? They're not decorated pillars eh.

(    In Japanese mythology, Gozu and Mezu are often the guardians to the gates
of the underworld, or similar. Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be a
way to tell which statue is who.)
