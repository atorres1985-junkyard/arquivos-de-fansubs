Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

[Closeup side view of Kagome.]

Kagome: are the feelings humans would hold, no matter who they are.
<Kagome:    anta no Iu you na, HITO o NOROu KIMOchi ja nai.>
Kagome: They are not the feelings of cursing someone, like you were trying to say.

(    I guess what Kagome means is that even if some part of her was happy when
she heard Kikyou was dead, or that gets annoyed with Inuyasha for example,
those are only part of her overall feelings. That she doesn't have to hate
herself or Inuyasha over having such feelings. I guess where Kagome is
different from most people however, is that she doesn't mask or bottle up
her feelings, and can recognise her feelings and examine herself well
enough that spots of darkness on her soul fade away, as it were. Maybe
another way of putting it is Kagome is flexible enough and doesn't try to
be perfect or expect others to be. It seems Kikyou (when she was alive) and
Hakushin-shounin tried to be perfect, which is possibly the cause of their
downfall. Anyway, back to the plot...)

[Inuyasha rushes forwards.]

Inuyasha: Kagome!!

3
[Inuyasha catches Kagome.]
Fx Inuyasha: fwip <Ba_>

4
[Inuyasha, holding Kagome, looks up at Kagura who's holding the baby.]
<baby:    sono ONNA... NARAKU ga iyagaru wake da na.>
baby: That girl... So that's the reason Naraku can't stand her.
