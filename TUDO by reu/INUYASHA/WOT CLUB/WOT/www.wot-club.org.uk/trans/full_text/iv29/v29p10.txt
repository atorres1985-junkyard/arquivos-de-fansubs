Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

Shinosuke: There was no trace of my fiancee Wakana either...
<Kagome:    maa...>

4
[Drawing of Shinosuke looking depressed.]
<Shinosuke:    SEISHI mo wakaranu mama SAGAshi agunete TOHOU ni KUrete iru TOKI,>
Shinosuke: I was at my wit's end, searching not knowing if she was dead or alive,
<Shinosuke:    KAZE no UWASA de...>

[View of Shinosuke, and Miroku and Inuyasha.]

<Sango:    iya...>
Sango: Erm...
<Sango:    FUKAi IMA wa nai kedo sa.>

[View of Inuyasha and Miroku.]
<Inuyasha:    de, dou nan da MIROKU.>
Inuyasha: So, what do you think Miroku.
<Inuyasha:    kono ONNA SHUURAKU.>

[Closeup of Inuyasha looking around.]
<Inuyasha:    JAKI ya YOUKI o KANjiru ka?>

<Miroku:    onago bakari de, sazoya oKOKOROBOSOi deshou.>
Miroku: With only women here, it must be rather lonely.
<girl:    hai, HOUSHI-sama.>

3
[Inuyasha puts a hand to his head as if a bit frustrated.]
<Inuyasha:    ke_ kono YOUSU ja,>
Inuyasha: .oO(Bah, in this place,).
<Inuyasha:    JAKI wa nee tte koto ka...>
Inuyasha: .oO(is there no evil energy huh...).

4
[Inuyasha suddenly looks quite nervous - he's inbetween Miroku and Sango -
who is giving Miroku a very dark and angry look with dark energy swirling
around her.]
Fx swirl of dark energy: roa-a-r <Go--->
<Inuyasha:    tte, SAKKI.>
Inuyasha: .oO(Er, murderous energy!).

(    I tend to translate "jaki" as "evil energy" and "youki" as "Youkai energy".
The word Inuyasha uses here is "sakki" which roughly translates as "intent
to kill" or "blood lust" for example (fairly generic) - it's basically the
"energy" from the intent or desire to kill someone and you'll sometimes see
manga/anime characters (typically samurai warriors) using this as well as
sensing it. It's also used in "if looks could kill" comical situations like this.)

5
[Closeup of Sango, partly recovered.]
<Sango:    sorosoro Ikanai?>
Sango: Shouldn't we be going?
<Sango:    koko wa atashi-tachi ga SAGAshite-ru ONI ONNA no SHUURAKU to CHIGAu n-desho?>
Sango: This isn't the community of oni-women we've been looking for is it.

[Sango and Kagome turn to look behind them.]
<village woman:    douzo HITOBAN oTOmari kudasai.>
village woman: {off} Please stay for the night.

2
[View of the slightly older woman from earlier.]
<village woman:    mamonaku HIGUre desu shi...>
village woman: It'll be getting dark soon...
<village woman:    roku na omotenashi mo dekimasen ga...>
village woman: We can't offer you much, but...

3
[Miroku makes a show of gratitude and behind him, Sango looks quite annoyed.]
<Miroku:    oKOTOBA ni AMAete.>
Miroku: We gratefully accept your offer.
<Sango:    HOUSHI-sama_!>
Sango: Houshi-sama!

4
[Behind the older woman are two younger ones, who look rather happy. The
older woman makes a guesture in one direction.]
<village girl:    dewa, ONNA no kata wa WATASHI-domo to ISSHO ni.>
village girl: Then, if the ladies would come with us.
<village woman:    TONO-GATA wa achira ni.>
village woman: This way for the gentlemen.

5
[Kagome and Sango look a bit surprised.]
<Kagome:    e, BETSUBETSU?>
Kagome: Eh, separately?

[Scene change. View of a small lamp sand.]

[Closeup of Miroku, looking calm and serious.]
<Miroku:    INUYASHA,>
Miroku: Inuyasha,
<Miroku:    yahari TABIDAtsu koto ni suru ka?>
Miroku: maybe we should continue our travel after all?



Page 17

[Inuyasha, Shinosuke, Shippou and Miroku are alone in a room. Shinosuke and
Miroku both look rather depressed, though for different reasons. Inuyasha
is glaring at Miroku.]
<Inuyasha:    nani Itte n-da.>
Inuyasha: What are you saying.
<Inuyasha:    omae, TOmaru no ni OO NOri KI datta ja nee ka.>
Inuyasha: You're the one who had the big desire to stay.
<Shippou:    ora-tachi to ISSHO na no ga FUFUKU na no ka.>
Shippou: Aren't you satisfied with staying with us?
<Miroku:    fu--->
Miroku: *siiiigh*

2
[Scene change. At night, view of the forest.]
Fx sky: *ominous rumble...* <Goo...>

3
[View of a temple building perhaps, seperate from the rest of the village.]
Fx leaves: rustle... <Zaa...>

4
[A village girl is standing outside, looking into the building.]
village girl: ......

5
[Closeup of the girl. She's the one who met the samurai earlier.]
<village girl:    SHINOSUKE-san...>
village girl: Shinosuke-san...



Page 18

[View of the girl sitting before the doors to the room, looking a bit down.]

of the mouth, with blood around it.]

voice: bring the man here...
Fx sound: *chew...* <Kucha...>

4
[Closeup of Wakana. She seems to have tears in her eyes, and looks quite frightened.]
<Wakana:    ha...>
Wakana: I...
<Wakana:    hai...>
Wakana: I will...
