Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

[The blast hits a large round barrier around Kagura and Kanna. (it's
probably just because she's drawn a bit small but Kanna has this rather
cute dopey expression.)]

<Inuyasha:    KAZE no KIZU ga SUiKOmareru!?>
Inuyasha: .oO(The Cutting Wind is being sucked inside!?).

[The blast seems to curve around the barrier.]
Fx barrier: plock <Bobo>
Fx barrier: crackle crackle <Bachi Bachi Bachi>

[Inuyasha and the others look on in shock as light flashes on them.]
Inuyasha: !
<Miroku:    ikan!>
Miroku: Oh no!
<Miroku:    NIgero, minna!!>
Miroku: Take cover, everyone!!

[As the Cutting Wind is thrown back, Inuyasha jumps away carrying Kagome,

[Kagura, Kanna and the baby rise up into the air inside the round barrier.
The temple has been pretty much destoryed.]
Fx air: whoosh <Go--->
Fx wood: crack crack <Baki Baki Baki>

2
[Closeup side view of Inuyasha looking up.]
<Inuyasha:    chikushou...>
Inuyasha: .oO(Dammit...).
<Inuyasha:    KAZE no KIZU o KAEshi-yagatta.>
Inuyasha: .oO(The Cutting Wind was returned.).



Page 12
1
[View of the baby.]
<baby:    kukuku... korede SUnda to OMOu na.>
baby: Kukuku... Don't think it's over.
<baby:    mata Ai ni Kuru zo...>
baby: I'll be back sometime...

2
[View of Inuyasha shouting. (He's still carrying Kagome, who's still unconscious)]
<Inuyasha:    yakamashii, temee!>
Inuyasha: Shut-up you bastard!
<Inuyasha:    KONDO kagome ni TEeDAshi yagatta-ra...>
Inuyasha: The next time you try anything against Kagome...

3
[View of Kagura, Kanna and the baby up in the air.]
<baby:    kukuku, sou wa ikan.>
baby: Kukuku, that's not it.
<baby:    sono ONNA wa, kono YO de YUIITSU SHIKON no kakera o SAGAseru ONNA da kara na.>
baby: That girl is the only one in the entire world who can search for Shikon fragments after all.

(    Does this contradict stuff from earlier in the series? Not really, since
Kagome can sense Shikon fragments from a long distance and see them very
accurately. Others have only been able to sense and see Shikon fragments
when very close. As the number of Shikon fragments that haven't yet been
found decreases, the chance of finding one at random reduces significantly
- a few needles in a very very large hay stack. Since Kagome can sense
fragments from a long distance, maybe the plan is to control Kagome and
then fly around with Kagura, covering large distances quickly. Might seem a
bit silly to throw back the Cutting Wind at Kagome (and the rest) though,
but I guess from the bad guys point of view, if anyone dies it's no real
loss, since finding the fragments is just a matter of time either way.)

4
[Miroku and Sango look a bit surprised.]
<Miroku:    nani!?>
Miroku: What!?

<baby:    kagome no ME o WARE-ra no mono ni sureba,>
baby: If we can make use of Kagome's eyes,
<baby:    SHIKON no TAMA wa KANSEIsuru.>
baby: the Shikon no Tama will be completed.
<baby:    ZOUO ni mamireta SHIKON no TAMA ga na.>
baby: Though it's be a Shikon no Tama smeared with hatred.

2
[Closeup of Inuyasha.]
<Inuyasha:    Baka ka, temee.>
Inuyasha: Are you stupid or what.
<Inuyasha:    kagome ga, NARAKU nanzo no tame ni HATARAku to HONKI de OMOtte n-no ka.>
Inuyasha: Did you really think Kagome would work for the likes of Naraku?

3
[View of Inuyasha and co on the ground, from up in the air.]
<baby:    fun...>
baby: Humph...
<baby:    sono ONNA ni mo tsukeiru Suki wa ikurademo aru.>
baby: There are any number of ways to crack that girl.

<baby:    urusai.>
baby: Shut up.
<baby:    washi wa shibaraku NEru.>
baby: I'll be sleeping for a while.

[Closeup of the baby looking a bit peeved.]

<Shippou:    NEMUri TSUZUketoru ga...>
Shippou: She's still sleeping, but...
<Miroku:    INUYASHA ga tsuite masu kara.>
Miroku: Inuyasha is with her.

[Kagome looks up at Inuyasha.]
Kagome: ......

4
[Closeup of Kagome smiling a bit.]
<Kagome:    sou ka...>
Kagome: That's right...
<Kagome:    INUYASHA... KIte kureta n-da...>
Kagome: You came for me... Inuyasha...

5
[Closeup of Inuyasha looking a bit apologetic.]
<Inuyasha:    aa...>
Inuyasha: Yeah...
<Inuyasha:    sumanakatta.>
Inuyasha: I'm sorry.

6
[Kagome sits up.]
<Inuyasha:    ore ga inakatta kara...>
Inuyasha: Since I wasn't there...
<Kagome:    ii yo, BETSU ni.>
Kagome: It's okay, really.



Page 17

[Inuyasha gets a bit angry.]
<Inuyasha:    yokunee daro!>

Inuyasha: .oO(and I would have also lost Kagome's life as well.).

3
[Closeup of Kagome.]
<Kagome:    datte... moshimo mata KIKYOU no TEgakari o KIkasaretara,>
Kagome: Well... if you happen to hear a clue about Kikyou,
<Kagome:    SAGAshi ni Iku desho.>
Kagome: you'll leave, won't you.

4
[Closeup of Inuyasha looking serious.]
<Inuyasha:    Ikanee!>
Inuyasha: I won't go!

5
[Inuyasha speaks seriously to Kagome who gives him a dubious look, but
somewhat gently.]
<Inuyasha:    mou omae no soba kara HANArenee.>
Inuyasha: I won't leave your side again.
<Kagome:    Uso tsuki.>
Kagome: Liar.



Page 18
1
[Inuyasha is a bit taken aback.]
<Inuyasha:    na"_,>
Inuyasha: _Wha_,
<Inuyasha:    Uso ja nee.>
Inuyasha: I'm not lying.
<Kagome:    anta wa Icchau yatsu no yo.>
Kagome: You're a guy who'd leave.
<Kagome:    dore dake anta to tsukiatte-ru to OMOtte n-no yo.>
Kagome: Just how long do you think I've known you for.

2
[Closeup of Kagome, sort of giving a warning.]
<Kagome:    dakedo, sono TOKI WATASHI wa Mutsu to suru wa yo.>
Kagome: However, when it happens, I'll get miffed.
<Kagome:    sono kurai TOUZEN yo ne.>
Kagome: That much is obvious.

3
[Closeup of Inuyasha with a sort of gentle expression, realising something.]
<Inuyasha:    kagome...>
Inuyasha: Kagome...

4
[Inuyasha looks at Kagome, who is sitting next to Inuyasha leaning against
him. She seems a bit annoyed, but coping with it.]
<Inuyasha:    oi...>
Inuyasha: Hey...
<Inuyasha:    yappa OKOtte n-daro.>
Inuyasha: You're angry after all, aren't you.
<Kagome:    OKOtte-ru kedo...>
Kagome: I'm angry, but...
<Kagome:    SUki dakara shouganai wa yo.>
Kagome: .oO(Because I love you, I can't help it.).

(    Because Kagome loves Inuyasha, she gets jealous of Kikyou. Because she
loves him, she gets angry with him when he's "two timing" her. Because she
loves him, she forgives him (as much as she can).)
