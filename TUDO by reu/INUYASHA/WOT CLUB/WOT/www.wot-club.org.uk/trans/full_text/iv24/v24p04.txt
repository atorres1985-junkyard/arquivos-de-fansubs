Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

villager#1: The fields are laid waste, and we're in a desperate situation.
<villager#2:    kono mama dewa MINA, Uete SHInu hoka...>

Inuyasha: We don't have time for this.
<Miroku:    ANSHINshiro.>

Fx sound: rustle <Gasa_>
<Inuyasha:    n!?>
Inuyasha: Hm!?

4
[The group look up in surprise to see a huge monkey above them, coming down
towards them. It's quite a lot large than Inuyasha and has nasty looking
claws and teeth and has one huge cyclops eye.]
Fx youkai monkey: shh <Za_>
<youkai monkey:    kisama-ra~~_.>
youkai monkey: You bastards!

heap of leaves. Each of them has a simple little jacket as clothing.]

reaction to seeing something cute - holding up both hands near her chest.]

<Shippou:    KOZARU ja.>
Shippou: Monkey kids.
<Kagome:    yada_, kawaii_.>

[View of Shippou.]
<Shippou:    ...INUYASHA...>

[Inuyasha turns to Shippou, holding the small stone.]
<Inuyasha:    nandei SHIPPOU.>
Inuyasha: What's up Shippou.
Fx stone: *weigh down...* <zushi...>
<Shippou:    YUDANsasete nanika o TEWATAsu no wa...>
Shippou: Handing over something while the other's guard is down...

5
[Inuyasha is suddenly pulled down by a huge boulder - a much larger version
of the rock he was handed.]
Fx rock: *weigh down...* <Zushi...>
<Shippou:    ora-tachi SHOU YOUKAI no GENJUTSU no KIHON ja kara, UkeTOranu hou ga ii to OMOtta n-jaga...>
Shippou: like for me, is the foundation of small Youkai's trickery, so it's better not to accept anything, but...

[However, the monkeys were too close and Inuyasha thumps them on the head
with his free hand.]

4
[Closeup of Inuyasha glaring angrily.]
<Inuyasha:    temee-ra, WARUfuzake mo taigai ni shinee to...>
Inuyasha: You bastards, you stop this prank or else I'm...

5
[The monkeys, with lumps on their heads, still seem confident.]
<big-eyed monkey:    fu, fun, sugonda tte MUDA ja.>
big-eyed monkey: Hu, humph, threatening us is futile.
<mean-eyed monkey:    ware-ra ga JUTSU o TOkanu kagiri,>
mean-eyed monkey: As long as we don't break our spell,
<mean-eyed monkey:    sono IWA wa kisama no TE kara KEsshite HANArenu.>

[Closeup of Inuyasha with a sort of smile.]

[Kagome turns back to look at an angry Inuyasha, who drops the rock.]
Fx rock: whump <zun>
<Inuyasha:    oi_, kagome_.>
Inuyasha: Hey! Kagome!
<Kagome:    INUYASHA, soko de MAtte-te.>
Kagome: Inuyasha, wait there.

Shippou: only those who created the trickery can remove it.
<Kagome:    maa.>
Kagome: Oh my.

5
[View of a dark run-down looking building ahead.]
Fx Kagome: shh shh <Za_ Za_>



Page 13

though a finely designed structure.]
Fx Kagome: shh... <Za...>

2
[Closeup of Kagome.]
<Kagome:    HOKORA...>
Kagome: A hokora...

(    A "hokara" is a small shrine.)

3
[Kagome sees some small footprints leading to the shrine.]
<Kagome:    n? ASHI ATO...>
Kagome: Hm? Footprints...

4
[View inside - the three monkeys of huddling together, shivering, though
it's not clear why.]
Fx monkeys: *shiver shiver* <gata gata gata>

5
[Kagome casually enters the building.]
<Kagome:    nee.>
Kagome: Hi.



Page 14
1
[Kagome has handed some lolly-pops (candy ball on a stick) to the monkeys,
and Shippou has one too.]

<Kagome:    dou shite MURA no HATAKE ni Itazura suru no?>
Kagome: Why did you do that prank to the villagers' fields?
<mean-eyed monkey:    Itazura nado dewa nai_.>

[Drawing of the shrine in flames.]
<mean-eyed monkey:    tokoroga IKUSA no sei de HOKORA ga YAkeOchi,>
mean-eyed monkey: {voice over} However due to a war, the hokora was burnt down,
<mean-eyed monkey:    SARUGAMI-sama no YADOtte orareru goSHINTAI ga, NANIMONOka ni MOchiSArarete shimouta.>
mean-eyed monkey: the go-shintai in which Sarugami-sama resides was taken away by someone.

(    The "go-shintai" (literally "god body") of a (Shinto) Shrine is where the
god of the shrine resides (when at the Shrine), and the most valuable
object in any shrine. It's quite common for a "go-shintai" to be a mirror.)

2
[Kagome is looking at the monkeys.]
<Kagome:    sono SARUGAMI-sama no goSHINTAI ga, MURA ni aru tte iu koto?>
Kagome: So you're saying that the villagers have Sarugami-sama's go-shintai?
<mean-eyed monkey:    umu.>

[View of the monkey with his arms folded.]
<mean-eyed monkey:    ware-ra wa, goSHINTAI wa MURA no HATAKE ni Umerarete oru to funde iru.>
mean-eyed monkey: We guessed that the go-shintai was buried in a village field.
<mean-eyed monkey:    naze nara,>
mean-eyed monkey: Because,

4
[View of the three monkeys.]
<mean-eyed monkey:    SARUGAMI-sama kara YUME no oTSUge ga atta.>
mean-eyed monkey: Sarugami-sama informed us in a dream.
<small-eyed monkey:    washi mo YUME o mita.>
small-eyed monkey: I saw the dream too.
<big-eyed monkey:    washi mo washi mo.>
big-eyed monkey: Me too, me too.

5
[View of the three monkeys discussing things.]
<mean-eyed monkey:    KURAkute SHIMEppoi TOKORO ni oru to no koto de atta.>
mean-eyed monkey: It was a place that was dark and damp.

small-eyed monkey: I was told it was a cramped and stuffy place.
<big-eyed monkey:    washi ni wa, YASAI KUSAkute Iya da to uttaete orareta.>

expression but suggests a warning.]
<Kagome:    ano ne.>
Kagome: You know.

5
[View of Kagome talking to the monkeys.]
<Kagome:    WARUi koto wa Iwanai kara,>
Kagome: For your own sake,
<Kagome:    INUYASHA ni kaketa JUTSU, HAYAku TOita hou ga ii wa.>
Kagome: the sooner you remove that spell you put on Inuyasha, the better.
<mean-eyed monkey:    sou wa ikan.>
mean-eyed monkey: Can't do.

6
[View of the three monkeys making a pose. (got rising sun behind them)]
Fx pose image: ta-daa <bo--->
<mean-eyed monkey:    naze nara,>
mean-eyed monkey: Because,
<mean-eyed monkey:    TOku JUTSU o WASUreta kara ja.>
mean-eyed monkey: we've forgotten the remove spell.



Page 17

[Inuyasha has arrived, still with the boulder on his right arm. He looks
pretty annoyed.]
Fx boulder: thu-u-ump <Zu-n>
<Inuyasha:    nan ja sorya~~>
Inuyasha: Whaddiya say-y-y?
Fx Inuyasha: wheeze wheeze <ze- ze->
<mean-eyed monkey:    gie.>
mean-eyed monkey: Gieh.

2
[Shippou talks to the terrified monkeys.]
<Shippou:    omae-ra, Toboke-te oru to Kega o suru zo.>
Shippou: You guys, if you're kidding you'll get hurt.
<Shippou:    INUYASHA wa, KODOMO AITE ni mo TEKAGENsuru to iu koto o SHIran no ja.>
Shippou: Inuyasha doesn't know the meaning of going easy on children.
<mean-eyed monkey:    Toboke-te nado oran.>
mean-eyed monkey: We aren't kidding.

3
[The monkeys do their post again.]
Fx pose image: ta-daa <bo-->
<mean-eyed monkey:    kirei sappari,>
mean-eyed monkey: We've completely and utterly,
<mean-eyed monkey:    WASUrete shimouta no da.>
mean-eyed monkey: forgotten it.

4
[The monkeys all have lumps on their heads again, and Inuyasha seems even angrier.]
Fx Inuyasha: *breathing hard* <ha- ha->
Fx monkeys: clunk... <mishi...>
<Kagome:    KOMAtta wa ne.>
Kagome: This is a problem, isn't it.



Page 18

[Inuyasha hauls the boulder above the monkeys.]
Fx Inuyasha: (boulder) *haul up...* <gu_>
<Inuyasha:    KOROsu.>
Inuyasha: You die.
<mean-eyed monkey:    MAte.>
mean-eyed monkey: Wait.

2
[Closeup of the nervous looking monkeys.]
<mean-eyed monkey:    SARUGAMI-sama sae MITSUkareba JUTSU wa TOkeru.>

3
[Closeup of Kagome.]
<mean-eyed monkey:    nanishiro kono JUTSU wa, SARUGAMI-sama kara OSOwatta mono dakara na.>
mean-eyed monkey: {off} At any rate, we were taught this spell by Sarugami-sama you see.

<Kagome:    Ikou INUYASHA.>
Kagome: Let's go Inuyasha.
<Inuyasha:    e".>
Inuyasha: _Eh_.

5
[Kagome has jogged off into the distance, with the monkeys following behind
her. Shippou is looking at Inuyasha, who is dragging the boulder angrily.]
<Kagome:    SAKI Iku wa yo--_.>
Kagome: I'll go on ahead!
<mean-eyed monkey:    jitto MAtte oreba yokatta mono o.>
mean-eyed monkey: You should have just waited where you were.
<Shippou:    TSUKArenu ka? INUYASHA.>
Shippou: You tired, Inuyasha?
<Inuyasha:    KIku na_.>
