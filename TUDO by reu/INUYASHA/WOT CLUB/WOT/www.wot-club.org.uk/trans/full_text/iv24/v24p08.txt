Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

<Title:    SHICHININTAI>
Title: Shichinin-tai

(    Perhaps the closest equivilant meaning in english to "Shichinin-tai" is "7
man army" though the literal translation would be "7 person squad". By the
way, "-tai" is a suffix often used at the end of the name of a group, and
sometimes the Shichnin-tai are referred to as just Shichinin.)

[View of just behind Jakotsu as the horsemen stop their horses just in front
of him. Jakotsu is carrying a large sword on his back, which has a curved
