Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

[Inuyasha and co face off against Jakotsu, surrounded by a circle of corpses.]
<Inuyasha:    temee...>
Inuyasha: You bastard...
<Inuyasha:    ittai nan nan da!>
Inuyasha: What the hell are you!?

[Closeup of Inuyasha making a point.]
<Inuyasha:    Ikite-ru NINGEN no NIOi ga shinee!>
Inuyasha: You don't smell like a living human!
<Inuyasha:    SHIBITO to... HAKATSUCHI no NIOi da!>
Inuyasha: You smell of a corpse... and burial soil!

2
[Jakotsu has a slight smile.]
<Jakotsu:    hee.>
Jakotsu: Oooh.

3
[Miroku addresses Inuyasha.]
<Miroku:    INUYASHA, koitsu moshiya...>
Miroku: Inuyasha, you mean this guy could be...
<Inuyasha:    aa.>
Inuyasha: Yeah.

4
[View of Inuyasha addressing Jakotsu.]
<Inuyasha:    TOCHI no RENCHUU ga UWASAshite-ta ze.>
Inuyasha: There's a rumour going around this area.
<Inuyasha:    Tachi no WARUi BOUREI ga, HAKA kara DEte KItta tte na.>
Inuyasha: That a nasty zombie had come out from a grave, that is.

[View of Inuyasha and Miroku.]
<Miroku:    SHICHININ no GEDOU no SHUUDAN...>
Miroku: That filthy group of seven soldiers out for hire...
<Miroku:    TOUBATSU-TAI ni Oitsumerarete KUBI o hanerareta YATOware HEITAI,>
Miroku: who were by cornered by an army sent to subjugate them, and had their heads cut off...
<Miroku:    SHICHININTAI no hitori ka!?>
Miroku: Are you one of the Shichinin-tai!?

2
[Closeup of Jakotsu, who seems to be staring a bit. (somewhat vacantly)]
Jakotsu: ......

3
[Closeup of Miroku looking stern.]
<Miroku:    KOTAero.>
Miroku: Answer.

4
[Closeup of Jakotsu with a happy smile.]
<Jakotsu:    INUYASHA mo kawaii kedo,>
Jakotsu: Not only is Inuyasha cute,
<Jakotsu:    socchi no HOUSHI mo IROppoi na.>
Jakotsu: but that houshi is sexy.
<Jakotsu:    hi-hi- Iwashite mite-_.
I think "hiihii" is scream or something. I'm not sure what "iwasu" (iwasuru?) is though.
>
Jakotsu: I'd love to see his agonised face.

5
[View of the group. Sango and Inuyasha's expressions are rather similar -
shocked and disbelieving. Kagome is simply wide-eyed, and Miroku has his
eyes closed as if thinking something to awful to contemplate.]
<group:    koitsu...>
group: .oO(This guy...).

6
[Miroku begins to unwrap the seal on his cursed hand, but Kagome suddenly appears.]
<Miroku:    SUttemo ii desu ka.>
Miroku: Is it okay to suck him up.
<Inuyasha:    ou.>
Inuyasha: Go ahead.
<Kagome:    chotto MAtte.>
Kagome: Wait a sec.

[Closeup of Kagome making a point.]
<Kagome:    aitsu... SHIKON no kakera o MOtte-ru!>
Kagome: That guy... has a Shikon fragment!
<Kagome:    kakera no CHIKARA de IkiKAEtta no kamo...>
Kagome: Maybe the fragment's power resurrected him...

2
[Miroku and Inuyasha look surprised and disturbed.]
Inuyasha: !

3
[Closeup of Inuyasha shouting angrily.]
<Inuyasha:    temee...>
Inuyasha: You bastard...
<Inuyasha:    SHIKON no kakera,>
Inuyasha: Who inserted,
<Inuyasha:    DARE ni SHIKOmareta!?>
Inuyasha: the Shikon fragment!?

4
[Closeup of Jakotsu with a smile, and a glow coming from his neck.]
<Jakotsu:    hehehe...>
Jakotsu: Hehehe...
<Jakotsu:    OKOtta KAO mo mata ii nee.>
Jakotsu: Your angry face is even better.
Fx fragment: *glow...* <Pou...>

[Inuyasha angrily draws Tetsusaiga.]
<Inuyasha:    yakamashii HENTAI YAROU!>
Inuyasha: Shut up you perverted bastard!
<Inuyasha:    dou attemo, SHItte-ru koto ARAizarai shibette morau ze!!>
Inuyasha: No matter what, I'll force you to tell what you know!!
Fx Tetsusaiga: shing <Za_>

2
[Closeup of Jakotsu, smiling.]
<Jakotsu:    hee, omoshiree KATANA MOtte n-naa.>
Jakotsu: Ooh, that's an interesting sword you have there.
<Jakotsu:    ore no KATANA to...>
Jakotsu: Your's or mine...



Page 7
1
[Jakotsu swings his sword around in a blur.]
<Jakotsu:    doccha ga sugee ka na!>
Jakotsu: I wonder which is best!
Fx sword: swish <Sha_>

2
[A curling flash of movement attacks Inuyasha, who just manages to block it
with Tetsusaiga.]
Fx Tetsusaiga: clang clang <Kaka_>
Inuyasha: !?



Page 8
1
[Miroku puts himself in front of the girls and they all move back.]
<Miroku:    sagatte!>
Miroku: Get back!
<Miroku:    SHIKOmiGATANA desu!>
Miroku: It's a concealed sword!
Fx Miroku: shh <Za_>

(    Miroku says "shikomi-gatana" which is a sword in a scabbard designed to
look like a walking cane. Since Jakotsu is obviously carrying a sword, this
sounds a bit strange - I guess in this case he just means that it's a sword
with a concealed attack.)


2
[Jakotsu is holding up his sword above him with a smile. There is a blur of
movement of something seemingly folding into the sword.]
Fx sword: chink <Cha_>
<Jakotsu:    hehe_.>
Jakotsu: Heheh!

3
[Closeup of Sango.]
<Sango:    MYOU da to wa OMOtte-da n-da.>
Sango: I had thought it was strange.
<Sango:    ASHIGARU-tachi no yarareKATA...>
Sango: The way in which the foot-soldiers were killed...

4
[View of the circle of dead soldiers.]
<Sango:    ICHIDO ni Bassari yararete-ru!>
Sango: indicates they were quickly wiped out!
<Sango:    yatsu to KIriMUSUbu HIMAmonaku...>
Sango: They didn't even have time to cross swords with him...



Page 9
1
[Closeup of Inuyasha looking angry and frustrated.]
<Inuyasha:    TObiDAshi no NAGAMONO da to wa OMOtte-ta ga, sore dake ja nee!>
Inuyasha: .oO(I thought he was projecting something long, but it's not so simple!).
<Inuyasha:    koitsu no KATANA...>
Inuyasha: .oO(This guy's sword...).

2
[Jakotsu makes another swing with his sword.]
Fx sword: swish <Sha_>

3
[Inuyasha blocks with Tetsusaiga again, but the blur of movement from the
attack curls around him and cuts him on the right arm.]
Fx Tetsusaiga: clang <Ka_>
Fx Inuyasha's arm: snick <Za_>
Inuyasha: !

4
[Miroku and Kagome look surprised and worried.]
<Miroku:    na...>
Miroku: Wha...
<Kagome:    INUYASHA!>
Kagome: Inuyasha!



Page 10
1
[Miroku, Kagome and Sango look on in shock.]
<Miroku:    MAgaru KATANA!?>
Miroku: A bending sword!?

2
[Closeup side view of Jakotsu happily making another attack.]
<Jakotsu:    dou daa!?>
Jakotsu: How do you like it!?
<Jakotsu:    kore ga SHICHININTAI KIrikomi TAICHOU...>
Jakotsu: This is the Shichinin-tai's Attack Captain...

3
[Jakotsu makes another attack on Inuyasha.]
<Jakotsu:    JAKOTSU-sama no JAKOTSUTOU daa!>
Jakotsu: Jakotsu-sama's Jakotsutou!
Fx Jakotsutou: swish <Sha_>

(    Jakotsu translates as "snake bone" (approximately) and Jakotsutou
translates as "snake bone sword".)



Page 11
1
[Inuyasha angrily swings around Tetsusaiga, knocking the attack.]
Fx Tetsusaiga: clang <Ka_>
<Inuyasha:    sharakusee.>
Inuyasha: Impudent!

2
[View of Jakotsu with a somewhat stunned look on his face. We can now see
the exact nature of his sword after Inuyasha knocked the attack back. At
the end of the main blade that Jakotsu holds is another blade, similarly
shaped which is connected to the main blade by a pin, allowing it to
rotate. A series of other blades are connected (a bit like a chain) which
allows the sword to both extend a long distance and rotate.]
Fx blade: clatter <Sharin **?? guessing>



Page 12
1
[Smiling, Jakotsu makes another attack.]
<Jakotsu:    fu_.>
Jakotsu: Humph!
Fx sword: *swing* <Bun>

2
[Inuyasha blocks with Tetsusaiga again.]
Fx swords: clang <Ka_>
<Inuyasha:    ku_.>
Inuyasha: Ugh.

3
[However, Jakotsu's sword curves around and cuts Inuyasha in the leg, and
hits the ground.]
Fx :  <Gugu... **?? 'strain against' doesn't make much sense here>
Fx Inuyasha's leg: snick <Sha_>
Fx ground: wham <Doka_>
Inuyasha: !

4
[View of Miroku and Kagome looking shocked.]
<Miroku:    haneKAEshitemo MODOtte kuru.>
Miroku: Even after deflecting it, it came back.
<Kagome:    ano KATANA... marude HEBI!>
Kagome: That sword... is like a snake!



Page 13
1
[Closeup of Jakotsu making another attack.]
Fx sword: swish <Sha_>
<Jakotsu:    motto NIge na!>
Jakotsu: Jump around more!

2
[The attack dives down just before Inuyasha, who jumps up into the air, to
strike the ground lightly, and curve around back up.]
Fx strike: *curl* <Shuru>
Fx ground: wham-am <Dogaga>

3
[The strike comes up and around from behind Inuyasha, cutting him in the face.]
Fx strike: swish <Sha_>
Fx Inuyasha: snick <Za_>
Inuyasha: !

4
[Jakotsu looks on at Inuyasha while his sword folds back.]
Fx sword: chink <Cha_>
<Jakotsu:    hehe_.>
Jakotsu: Heheh!



Page 14
1
[Closeup of Inuyasha looking in pain a bit, and somewhat confused.]
<Inuyasha:    chikushou...>
Inuyasha: .oO(Dammit...).
<Inuyasha:    doko kara YAIBA ga TOnde kuru ka wakaranee!>
Inuyasha: .oO(I can't tell where the blades will attack from!).

2
[Closeup side view of Jakotsu with an ecstatic kind of expression.]
<Jakotsu:    ii zo~ sono KAO.>
Jakotsu: Oooh, that expression is great.
<Jakotsu:    Zokozoku suru.>
Jakotsu: So thrilling.

3
[Jakotsu happily starts another strike.]
<Jakotsu:    motto MItte_.>
Jakotsu: I wanna see more!
Fx sword: swish <Sha_>

4
[Blur of movement.]
<Sango:    HIRAIKOTSU!>
Sango: Hiraikotsu!

5
[Sango's boomerang strikes Jakotsu's sword from the side, tangling it up.]
Fx Hiraikotsu: whizz <Gyan>
Fx Jakotsutou: clatter <Ja_>
Jakotsu: !



Page 15
1
[View of Sango in the action of having thrown her boomerang - this is from
Jakotsu's point of view.]
Fx Sango: shh... <Za...>

2
[Closeup of Jakotsu. He looks very darkly angry.]
<Jakotsu:    ONNA~~~?>
Jakotsu: A woma~a~an?

3
[Jakotsu angrily swings his sword around, taking Hiraikotsu with it.]
<Jakotsu:    teme--_.>
Jakotsu: You bitch!
Fx Jakotsu: *swing around heavy object* <Bun>
Fx Hiraikotsu: whizz <Gyan>



Page 16
1
[Sango's boomerang comes back to her, along with Jakotsu's blades.]
<Kagome:    kya_.>
Kagome: Kyah!
Fx ground: wham <Doga>
<Sango:    ku_.>
Sango: Ugh.

2
[A blade cuts Sango on the arm.]
Fx blade: vwip <Bi_>
Sango: !

3
[Kagome goes up to Sango, looking very worried.]
<Kagome:    SANGO-chan!>
Kagome: Sango-chan!
<Sango:    da, DAIJOUBU, kasutta dake...>
Sango: I, I'm okay, it's just a scratch...

4
[Jakotsu retrieves his sword, looking incensed.]
Fx blades: whish <Hyun>
Fx sword: chink <Cha_>

5
[Closeup of Jakotsu shouting angrily.]
<Jakotsu:    sukkondero ONNAa_!>
Jakotsu: Get back woman!
<Jakotsu:    ore to INUYASHA no TANOshimi o JAMAsun ja nee_!!>
Jakotsu: Don't you interfere with mine and Inuyasha's fun!!



Page 17
1
[Jakotsu turns to the side to see Inuyasha rushing at him.]
Fx Inuyasha: whoosh <Go_>
Jakotsu: !

2
[Inuyasha punches Jakotsu powerfully in the face.]
Fx Inuyasha: whack <Baki>
<Inuyasha:    KIMOchi WARUi n-da yo, temee wa__!>
Inuyasha: You're a really creepy bastard!



Page 18

[Jakotsu slides back some distance, but manages to stay on his feet.]
Fx Jakotsu: fwip <Ba_>

2
[Closeup of Jakotsu rubbing his face.]
<Jakotsu:    moo~~>
Jakotsu: She~e~esh
<Jakotsu:    TSUMEtee naa.>
Jakotsu: You're so cold.
Fx Jakotsu's cheek: *sting* <jii-n>

3
[Closeup of Inuyasha shouting angrily.]
<Inuyasha:    yakamashii! SHIKON no kakera o DARE kara moratta!?>
Inuyasha: Shut up! Who did you get that Shikon fragment from!?
<Inuyasha:    sassa to HAKUJOUshi-yagare.>
Inuyasha: You better fucking confess soon!

4
[Slight scene change to a ridge overlooking the pair's fight.]
Fx wind: whoosh... <Hyu--->

5
[View of some hunched person looking over the ridge. He seems kinda squat
and his is wearing white clothes including a mask of sorts over his face.
He has a box held on his back with several large tubes - weapons of some
kind presumably.]
Fx figure: hshht... <Shu-->
<figure:    gehehehe, yatte-ru yatte-ru~>
figure: Gehehehe, there he goes again.
<figure:    JAKOTSU no YAROU, kawattenee na~~>
figure: That jerk Jakotsu, he sure hasn't changed...
