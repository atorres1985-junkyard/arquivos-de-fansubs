Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

<Kouga:    NIOu ze...>
Kouga: You smell...

[Closeup of Kouga.]
<Kouga:    NINGEN demo nee, YOUKAI demo nee.>

<Kyoukotsu:    kono KYOUKOTSU-sama no CHINIKU ni nari na!>
Kyoukotsu: will become part of Kyoukotsu-sama's body!
Fx ground: wham <Ban>

(    Kyoukotsu refering to himself as "Kyoukotsu-sama" basically indicates a
massively inflated ego.)

[Distant view of what appears to have been a small battlefield. A figure is
sitting on what appears to be the body of a horse. Kohaku seems to be
kneeling nearby.]
<Kohaku:    hai, JAKOTSU-sama.>
Kohaku: Yes, Jakotsu-sama.
<Jakotsu:    _taku, ano usura Baka.
** "usura" == ? (guessing on "useless")
>
Jakotsu: Sheesh, that useless idiot.

(    "jakotsu" loosely translates as "snake skeleton/bones".)

2
[View of some dead solders, with crows picking at their flesh.]
<Jakotsu:    ma, sho- ga nai ka.>
Jakotsu: {off} Well, can't be helped I guess.
<Jakotsu:    aitsu, ore-tachi no NAKA de ICHIBAN YOWAkatta mon naa.>
Jakotsu: He was the weakest one amongst us you know.

3
[Side view of Jakotsu, who seems to be wondering about something. Looks like
a human guy, though is dressed a bit strange. He has white baggy leggings,
with a simple pattern, and a vest which kinda looks scaly, like a snakes.
He has fairly short hair, which seems tied up.]
<Jakotsu:    de sa, dou na no KOHAKU-chan.>
Jakotsu: So, what do you think Kohaku-chan.

4
[Closeup of Kohaku.]
<Kohaku:    ha?>
Kohaku: Huh?

5
[Closeup of Jakotsu - looks kinda happy. He has dark rimmed eyes, and either
likes dark lipstick or just has dark lips. Kinda handsome but looks a
bit... strange. (Reminds me of Musou, as Onigumo was called on his recent outing)]
<Jakotsu:    dakara sa, ore no AITE no INUYASHA tte no wa,>
Jakotsu: Well you know, my opponent is called Inuyasha,
<Jakotsu:    OTOKOMAE ka ttsu~~ no.>
Jakotsu: so I'm asking if he's handsome.

[Closeup of Kohaku.]
<Kohaku:    sou iu koto wa...>
Kohaku: I suggest...
<Kohaku:    goJIBUN de oTASHIkame kudasai.>
Kohaku: you go find out for yourself please.

2
[Closeup of Jakotsu, who seems to be in dream-land.]
<Jakotsu:    aa~~ HAYAku Aite-.>
Jakotsu: Ahhh... I want to meet him soon.
<Jakotsu:    INUYASHA...>
Jakotsu: Inuyasha...
Fx Jakotsu: *dreamy eyed expression* <powa--n>

3
[Side view of Inuyasha.]
<Jakotsu:    donna CHI no IRO o shite-ru n-daro.>
Jakotsu: {off} I wonder what colour your blood is.
