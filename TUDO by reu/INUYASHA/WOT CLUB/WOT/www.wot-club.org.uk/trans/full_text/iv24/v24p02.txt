Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

Title: The Lady Template

(    "lady" here is the "the lady of the castle", "hime" in Japanese. A more
descriptive translation would be "the lady used as a template". It seems
that the Oni does not have a real form, and models its form after others -
needs a "template".)
