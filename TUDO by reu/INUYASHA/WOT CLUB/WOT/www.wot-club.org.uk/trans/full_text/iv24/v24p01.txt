Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

flowing around the castle.]

2
[Miroku claps Sango's hands, to her surprise.]

Fx Inuyasha: clunk... <mishi...>
<Kagome:    HON_TOU ni Derikashi- nai n-dakara.>

[The oldish guy in charge and some others come into the room.]
Fx tono: *odd breathing* <Shu--->

<Miroku:    SUKOshi wa KIita you da na...>
Miroku: It seems it worked a bit...
Fx lady: *stagger...* <Yoro...>
<lady:    ku_...>
lady: Ugh...

(    Miroku says he put "nen" into the ash-salt, but "nen" loosely translates as
"prayer", though a very strong one - think of it as cross between a prayer
and a spell I guess.)

there's an evil aura around the place.]
<Miroku:    shikashi mazui na kono ONI... kanari TEGOWAi.>
