Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

pretty bad mood.]

<Shippou:    aru IMI, ICHIBAN TOOi SONZAI ja na.>
Shippou: In a sense, he's the furthest thing possible [from being a god].

3
[Kagome talks to the villagers.]
<Kagome:    SARUGAMI-sama shika JUTSU no TOkiKATA o SHIranai n-desu tte.>

villager: there's no go-shintai around.

3
[Miroku, Sango, Shippou and the three monkeys are talking to the villagers.]

<villager:    KOMAtta mon desu.>

Sango: What's up?
Fx Miroku and Sango: *whisper* <koso>
<Miroku:    iya, KOYOI wa kochi-ra ni TOmete itadakou to...>
Miroku: Well, I figured to stay here for the night...

4
[Miroku and Sango continue their discussion. The monkeys chat happily to
each other, while Shippou looks on. To the side, the villagers are
discussing things.]
Fx Miroku and Sango: *whisper whisper* <hiso hiso>
<Sango:    ii no? sonna iiKAGEN na koto de...>
Sango: You sure? That's really irresponsible...
<Miroku:    sono uchi nantoka naru deshou.>

<Inuyasha:    sabishikune- yo, ba-ka.>

[Scene change. Miroku, the monkeys, Sango, Kagome and the village head are
looking at the bowl.]
<village head:    kore ga nanika?>
village head: What is this?
<Miroku:    kore wa mata, KOUGOUshii.>
Miroku: This is something holy.
<mean-eyed monkey:    ko_, kore wa__.>

[The monkeys gather excitedly around the glowing bowl.]

<big-eyed monkey:    kore wa MACHIGAinaku SARUGAMI-sama no MIHIKARI_.>

<Inuyasha:    yappa HOTAKE shika ne- ja ne- ka yo.>

the monkeys with him.]

3
[Scene change. Closeup of the top of a barrel, which has a lid several
inches below the top. On top of the lid is a large round white-ish rock.
The rock is glowing and has a carving on the front, which is a bit like two
eyes with a large mustache below them.]
Fx rock: *sparkle...* <pika--...>

4
[Kagome is standing beside the barrel, and the monkeys are looking at it
excitedly, while some villagers watch.]
<Kagome:    yappari kono TSUKEMONO ISHI...>
Kagome: Like I thought, it's the pickle stone...
<Kagome:    HIKAtte-ru shi.>

<villager#2:    washi-ra nya MIen ga...>
villager#2: We can't see it though...
Fx villagers: *chatter chatter* <zawa zawa>

[The monkeys seem angrily with the villagers.]
<mean-eyed monkey:    na"_, nan to iu BachiAtari na koto o~~_.>

<Kagome:    SARUzaru MORI no SOTO de tte koto...?>

[The mean-eyed monkey points accusingly at the village head.]
<mean-eyed monkey:    Uso-tsuke, goSHINTAI wa MORI no OKU no HOKORA ni MAtte atta no da zo.>
mean-eyed monkey: Liar, the go-shintai was enshrined at the hokora in the forest.
<village head:    sou wa Ittemo.>

<big-eyed monkey:    IKUSA de HOKORA ga MOeru na ka, HISSHI de oTASUke MOUshi,>
big-eyed monkey: {voice over} When the hokora burnt because of the war, we desperately tried to save it...

7
[The monkeys, having carried the go-shintai way, leave it in a clearing (on
the edge of the forest?) and sit around it.]

[FlashBack The monkeys look to the side to see some acorns on the ground.
<mean-eyed monkey:    a_, Donguri.>
mean-eyed monkey: Ah! Acorns.

2
[The monkeys stray from the go-shintai eating the acorns. The wide-eyed
monkey, the furthest away, points off into the distance.]

[Kagome looks on while the mean-eyed monkey makes the classic "ah I get it!"
action - slap fist into your other hand's palm.]
<mean-eyed monkey:    oo.>
mean-eyed monkey: Ahh!
Fx mean-eyed monkey: clap <pomu>
<Kagome:    ...tsumari, sono mama WASUrechatta wake ne.>
Kagome: ...In other words, you forgot about it right.

4
[The god comes out of the go-shintai to the delight of the monkeys. The god
looks sort of like an old man - long white hair, beard and mustache, and
has a simple white robe around him. His face is rather like a monkeys, and
he's carrying a staff with vines around the top.]
<Sarugami:    MAtte ita zo yo~~~>
Sarugami: I've been waiting-g-g
Fx Sarugami: sproing <dero--n>
<monkeys:    SARUGAMI-sama-_.>

<wide-eyed monkey:    YASAI KUSAkatta zo yo-.>

2
[The god looks down at the monkeys, and Inuyasha arrives looking angrily.]
<Sarugami:    washi ga FUZAI no AIDA ni, kawatta koto wa naktta rou na-.>
Sarugami: You haven't been up to anything while I was away have you?
<mean-eyed monkey:    hai_, NANIGOTOmonaku...>
mean-eyed monkey: Of course, not a thing...
Fx boulder: thu-u-mp <Zu--n>
<Inuyasha:    kuora!>
Inuyasha: Hey!
<Shippou:    WASUrerareto-ru.>
Shippou: They've forgotten.

3
[Scene change. It's now morning, and some birds are flying in the sky.]
Fx bird: chirp... <chichi...>

4
[Miroku addresses some villagers.]
<Miroku:    ATARAshii HOKORA o TAtete oMATSUri sureba MURA o MAMOru to,>
Miroku: Sarugami-sama said that if you build him a new hokora,
<Miroku:    SARUGAMI-sama wa osshatte ori masu.>
Miroku: he'll protect the village.
<villagers:    hehe~.>
villagers: Understood.



Page 15

[Kagome is smiling at Inuyasha who is flexing his right hand, now that he's
free of the boulder.]
<Kagome:    yokatta wa ne INUYASHA,>
Kagome: It's better now isn't it Inuyasha,
<Kagome:    IWA ga torete.>
Kagome: with the rock off.
<Inuyasha:    ttaku.>
Inuyasha: Sheesh.
<Inuyasha:    tonda MICHIKUSA kucchimatta ze.>
Inuyasha: That was one hell of a side-trip.

2
[The monkey god bows slightly before Kagome, who smiles.]
<Sarugami:    KASHIKOi MUSUME yo, yoku zo washi no IBASHO o IiAtete kureta.>
Sarugami: You're a smart girl to have guessed right where I was.
<Sarugami:    REI o Iu zo yo.>
Sarugami: You have my thanks.
<Kagome:    ie...>
Kagome: No problem...
<Kagome:    OMOikkiri wakariYASUkatta shi.>
Kagome: It was really easy to figure out though.

3
[Inuyasha glares at the monkeys, who respond angrily.]
<Inuyasha:    omee-ra ga Baka-sugiru n-dei.>
Inuyasha: You guys are just too stupid.
<mean-eyed monkey:    nani ou, kisama koso,>
mean-eyed monkey: You dare _you_ say that.
<mean-eyed monkey:    yappari HATAKE da to HOru KI MANMAN datta dewa nai ka.>
mean-eyed monkey: You were fully intending to dig up the fields weren't you!

4
[The god gazes off into the distance, and Kagome looks slightly surprised at something.]
<Sarugami:    IKKOKU mo HAYAku DEtai to OMOtte otta zo yo.>
Sarugami: I wanted to get away from there as quickly as possible.
<Sarugami:    SOTO no IHEN ga KIgakari de no.>
Sarugami: I was afraid some disaster had struck out here.
<Kagome:    IHEN...?>
Kagome: Disaster...?

[Drawing of a large cloud of darkness way above the village, which has some
lights glowing in it. There seems to be a swarm of insects as well.]

Sarugami: {voice over} Soon after I was put on the pickle-barrel,
<Sarugami:    IMA made ni KANjita koto mo nai MAGAMAGAshii JAKI ga,>
Sarugami: there was an evil aura more terrible than anything I've felt before,
<Sarugami:    kono MURA no JOUKUU o TOOrisugite itta--->
Sarugami: which passed through the skies above the village...

2
[Closeup of Kagome looking slightly stunned.]
<Kagome:    e...!?>

[Miroku, Sango and Inuyasha suddenly get very interested.]
<Inuyasha:    na_...>
Inuyasha: Wha...
<Miroku:    SARUGAMI-sama, sore wa...>
Miroku: Sarugami-sama, that's...

4
[Closeup side view of the god.]

Sarugami: I don't know what it was, but...
<Sarugami:    washi wa Taru no NAKA kara soyatsu no KEHAI o Otta zo.>

[Kagome looks towards Inuyasha.]
<Kagome:    INUYASHA...>

<Sarugami:    JAKI wa USHITORA no HOUGAKU ni MUkatta zo yo.>
Sarugami: {voice over} The evil was heading in the direction of Ushitora.

2
[Continuation of the above.]
<Sarugami:    dono BASHO de KIeta ka made wa, KANjitore nan da ga...>
Sarugami: I couldn't feel where the evil vanished though...

<Kagome:    USHITORA...>
Kagome: .oO(Ushitora...).
<Kagome:    HOKUTOU no hou tte koto da wa.>
Kagome: .oO(That's to the north-east.).
