Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

Everyone except Sango has a slight smile - as usual, she looks more serious.]

armsman: {off} Shit, where has that fucking bitch run off to.

2
[Misty view of a group of 4-5 men are wading through the shallow waters of a
swamp, or lake, which has bunches of tall reeds to the side. Someone is
also on a horse, and the walking men all have spears or staffs.]
Fx water: splash <Basha_>
<armsman:    ABURACHOUJA-sama no WAKA-sama ni sakarai yagatte...>
armsman: To bloody oppose the Aburachouja-sama heir...

(    Actually, the armsmans says the "waka-sama of Aburachouja-sama", where
Aburachouja is the local lord, and "waka-sama" is a term of address for his
son and heir.)

3
[View of some of the armsman and the person on the horse - they all look a
bit rough, and the more richly dressed person on the horse has his right
arm in a sling, and a bandage around his head.]
Fx water: splash <Basha>
<waka:    MItsuketara TEASHI tatakiOtte yare.>
waka: When you find her, break her arms and legs.
<armsman:    ha, hai WAKA-sama.>
armsman: Y, yessir, waka-sama.

[A young peasant girl is hiding beside some reeds, sitting in the water.]
Fx water: {off} splash... <Basha...>
girl: ......

5
[Closeup of the girl, who has shortish black hair, freckles, fairly typical
peasant clothes and a cloth wrapped over the top of her head. She has tears
in her eyes and is shivering in fright.]
Fx girl: *tremble* <gata gata>
<girl:    aa~~>
girl: .oO(Ah~ahh~).
<girl:    ora doushiyo...>

[Off in the distance is the indistinct view of someone (a girl maybe)
getting some water from the lake in a bamboo pipe/container.]

armsman#1: There she is.
<armsman#2:    KOHARU ni CHIGAinee_.>
armsman#2: It's Koharu for sure!
Fx armsman#2:  <Za_>

3
[The second armsman makes a clumsy swing, missing the girl, who can't be
seen clearly.]
Fx armsman: (staff) *swing* <Bun>
girl: !

4
[The girl (who does rather look like Sango in her 'normal', non combat,
clothes) hits the armsman over the head with the bamboo container.]
Fx armsman: whack <Baki>
<armsman:    hau.>
armsman: Yeow.

5
[The armsman falls back in surprise, and part of the girl's lower body can
be seen standing up.]
Fx water: splash... <Basha...>
<armsman:    na"_...>
armsman: _Wha_...

6
[The freckled peasant girl (presumably Koharu) from earlier looks off in
surprise at this.]
Koharu: !?

7
[The rest of the armsmen and the "waka-sama" on the horse look at this scene
in surprise too.]
<waka:    na_,>
waka: Wh,
<waka:    nanja omae~_.>
waka: who the hell are you!?



Page 4
1
[We finally get a look at the new girl - it is Sango, with her boomerang
slung over her shoulder, looking faintly annoyed.]
Fx Sango: shh <Za_>
<Sango:    anta-ra koso nani?>
Sango: Likewise, who are you?
<Sango:    MIta toko FUTSUU no NINGEN mitai da kedo...>
Sango: You do seem to be ordinary humans, but...

2
[The earlier armsman now has a lump on his head and the young master looks
on too.]
<armsman:    ko... KOHARU ja nee.>
armsman: Sh... she's not Koharu.
waka: ......

3
[Closeup of the young master, who does seem to be a rather pathetic specimen.]
<waka:    UTSUKUshii.>
waka: She's beautiful.
<waka:    TSUrete KAEru.>
waka: Take her back.

4
[Four armsmen form a group and edge towards Sango, who doesn't seem too bothered.]

<armsman#2:    hei_.>
armsman#2: Yessir!

5
[Koharu comes out of her hiding place looking distressed.]
<Koharu:    ta... TAIHEN da.>
Koharu: .oO(Oh... oh no.).
<Koharu:    ano HTIO sarawareru!>
Koharu: .oO(She'll be kidnapped.).

(    Koharu probably intends to turn herself in so Sango doesn't get involved.)

[View of Inuyasha leaping through the air.]
Fx Inuyasha: fwip <Ba_>

2
[Inuyasha slugs three of the armsmen at once, knocking some teeth loose,

[The armsmen and young master (listing over the side of the horse) beat a
hasty retreat.]

<Miroku:    dou shimashita.>
Miroku: What happened.

4
[View of Miroku, seemingly from Koharu's point of view.]

5
[Koharu is surprised and taken aback by something - Miroku it seems.]
<Koharu:    a...>
Koharu: Ah...
Fx Koharu: (heart) *skip a beat* <doki...>

6
[Koharu has suddenly thrown her arms around Miroku's neck and looks very
happy. Miroku just stands there without any obvious expression, while
Kagome has keeled to the side a bit in shock.]
Fx Koharu: (Miroku) *hug* <hishi_>
<Koharu:    MIROKU-sama-_.>
Koharu: Miroku-sama-a!
<Koharu:    Aitakatta!>
Koharu: I missed you!

[Koharu and Miroku are now holding each other happily.]
<Koharu:    SANNEN buri desuu.>
Koharu: It's been three years.
<Miroku:    iya~ sukkari MICHIGAemashta na.>
Miroku: Wow, you look really different.

4
[Sango is just looking on in surprise, Inuyasha seems a bit confused, and
Kagome has sidled up to Inuyasha to whisper to him.]
Sango: ......
<Inuyasha:    TOMOdachi ka?>
Inuyasha: They're friends?
<Kagome:    nanka TANnaru oTOMOdachi IJOU tte KANji.>
Kagome: Somehow it feels like they're more than just friends.

5
[FlashBack Flashback to Koharu's past - a small, thin girl in dirty clothes working in some kind of room.
<Koharu:    IKUSA de OYAKYOUDAI nakushite,>
Koharu: {voice over} I lost my parents and siblings to war,

<Koharu:    ora MAINICHI NAite mashita.>
Koharu: and I cried every day.

7
[A slightly younger looking Miroku holds out some food (something and rice).
It's hard to say how Miroku looks, but I don't see him being younger than
about 14.]
<Koharu:    sonna TOKI...>
Koharu: {voice over} Then...
<Miroku:    oTAbe.>
Miroku: Eat this.
<Koharu:    {voice over} oHARAi no tame MURA ni YObarete KIte ita MIROKU-sama dake ga...>

Miroku: How old are you?
<Koharu:    JUUICHI...>
Koharu: Eleven...
<Koharu:    {voice over} soshite...>
Koharu: And so...

[Miroku turns to Koharu with a smile, and she goes wide-eyed.]
Fx wind: swish... <sa-...>
<Miroku:    KOHARU,>
Miroku: Koharu,
<Miroku:    WATASHI no KO o Unde kureru ka?>
Miroku: will you bear my child?
EndFlashBack]

3
[Inuyasha, Kagome and Sango all edge a long way backwards from Koharu and
Miroku, in shock.]
Fx Inuyasha, Kagome and Sango: swish swish <Zaazaza>
<Miroku:    are.>
Miroku: Hey.
<Miroku:    nani HIite n-desu ka.>
Miroku: What are you retreating for?

4
[Kagome and Sango are suddenly back in front of Miroku - Kagome has both
hands clenched, giving him an intense angry look, and Sango is giving him a
cold look.]
Fx Kagome and Sango: fwip <za_>
<Kagome:    MIROKU-sama, KODOMO ni made so-yu-...>
Kagome: Miroku-sama, you'd [say that] even to a _child_...!
<Sango:    Kedamono.>
Sango: Beast.

[Koharu is happily clasping both hands together looking off into the sky
with a tear in her eye. Behind her Kagome and Sango both do a massive prat-fall.]
<Koharu:    ora UREshikatta.>
Koharu: I was so happy.
Fx Kagome and Sango: (falling over) thunk thunk <bata bata>

6
[Kagome is speaking even angrlier to Miroku now, looking quite upset.]
<Kagome:    SEKININ tonnasai yo!>
Kagome: You take responsibility [for your actions]!
<Miroku:    haa...?>
Miroku: Huh...?



Page 9
1
[Miroku looks a bit embarrassed.]
<Miroku:    shikashi...>
Miroku: But...
<Miroku:    mada KOHARU ni wa YUBI IPPON FUrete imasen no de...>
Miroku: I haven't even layed a finger on Koharu yet...

2
[Sango is giving Miroku an angry look.]
<Sango:    HONTOU darou ne_.>
Sango: Are you sure about that!?
<Miroku:    KODOMO deshita shi...>
Miroku: She _is_ a child, and...

3
[FlashBack Miroku and Koharu are standing in a grassy field, and it looks like Miroku is about to leave.
<Koharu:    MIROKU-sama wa sugu MURA o SArare mashita kedo...>
Koharu: {voice over} Miroku-sama soon left the village, but...
<Koharu:    itsuka kitto MUKAe ni KIte kudasaru to...>
Koharu: he said that someday he would come to take me away...

4
[Time passes and Koharu now looks as she does now, and is at work, but from
behind a doorway, the young master is staring at her.]
<Koharu:    sore ga SAIKIN ABURACHOUJA no WAKA-sama ga,>
Koharu: {voice over} However, recently Aburachouja's son, 
<Koharu:    ora no koto iyarashii ME de MIru you ni natte...>
Koharu: had begun to look at me with with a lewd expression...
EndFlashBack]

5
[Koharu looks pained and saddened, and beside her Kagome has her hands
clasped in pity.]
<Koharu:    SAKUBAN toutou CHIKARAzuku de, OMOi o togeyou to nasarimashita no de...>
Koharu: and finally by force, last night he was able to accomplish his goal...
<Kagome:    sore de NIgedashita no?>
Kagome: So you ran away?

6
[Koharu continues, but Kagome seems to hear something she didn't quite expect.]
<Koharu:    hai.>
Koharu: Yes.
<Koharu:    MAKI de shitataka ni NAGUtte UGOkanaku natta Suki ni...>
Koharu: I took my chance after hitting him severely with some firewood...
<Kagome:    soo...>
Kagome: I see...

7
[Koharu comes to plead with Miroku.]
<Koharu:    MIROKU-sama,>
Koharu: Miroku-sama,
<Koharu:    ora o TSUrete tte kudasai.>
Koharu: please take me with you.

Koharu: I have nowhere to go.
<Koharu:    soreni...>
Koharu: Besides...

2
[Koharu grabs Miroku's hands, and he looks a bit embarrased. Inuyasha looks
a bit confused, Kagome looks surprised and disbelieving and Sango looks annoyed.]
<Koharu:    ora, mou JUUYON desu.>
Koharu: I'm fourteen now.
<Koharu:    MIROKU-sama no KO datte Ume masu.>
Koharu: I'll be happy to bear your child.

<Kagome:    atashi yori TOSHISHITA na no ni...>
Kagome: .oO(But she's even younger than I am...).
Fx Kagome: (heart) thump-thump <doki doki>

(    Kagome means (I think), that she thinks it's too early for having children
herself, while Koharu doesn't, but is even younger.)

4
[Miroku looks at Sango, who has gone a bit wide-eyed.]

5
[Miroku is suddenly grasping Sango's hands, and she looks quite annoyed.

end of the previous chapter, and Koharu's smiling face is shown in the mirror.]

<village headman:    sore wa KI no DOKU na MUSUMEGO ja na.>

4
[Miroku is talking to an oldish looking man - the village head.]
<Miroku:    kono MURA ni Oite yatte itadake masu ka, SONCHOU-sama.>
Miroku: May we leave her in her your care, sonchou-sama?
<village headman:    yoroshii deshou.>

(    "sonchou" means "village head", "sonchou-sama" - term of address for a
village head.)

[Miroku is holding Koharu in his lap, looking off into the distance.]
<Miroku:    TATAKAi ni nattara, omae no INOCHI o MAMOrinukeru ka douka wakaran.>

<Miroku:    WATASHI no Otte iru YOUKAI wa, sorekurai YAKKAI na AITE nan-da.>
Miroku: The Youkai who are after me, really are so difficult to deal with, you see.

[View of Miroku, with his eyes closed sadly, and Koharu looking up at him.]
<Miroku:    WATASHI tote omae to WAKAreru no wa TSURAi.>
Miroku: It will be painful for me to be seperated from you.

3
[A short distance behind Miroku, Inuyasha, Kagome, Shippou and Kirara are
all intently looking at the pair. A bit behind them is Sango, looking annoyed.]
<Inuyasha:    are SETTOKU shite n-no ka?>
Inuyasha: Is that supposed to persuade her [to stay]?
<Kagome:    KUDOitte-ru yo- ni shika, MIenai wa ne-.>
Kagome: It seems just like a seduction, doesn't it.

4
[Closeup of Sango, looking off into the distance.]
<Sango:    ttaku, Betabeta shichatte.>
Sango: Sheesh, clinging together like that.
<Sango:    are ja MIREN ga NOKOru dake ja nai.>
Sango: That will just leave a lingering affection, won't it.

5
[While Kagome, Shippou and Kirara stare raptly off at Miroku and Koharu,
Inuyasha is staring at Sango.]
Fx Inuyasha: *stare...* <ji--...>

Sango: ...What.



Page 16

[Closeup of Inuyasha looking off at Sango.]
<Inuyasha:    ore no KI no sei kamo shirene- ga,>
Inuyasha: Maybe this is just my imagination, but,
<Inuyasha:    SANGO, ome- sakki kara nanka Biribiri shitene- ka?>
Inuyasha: Sango, haven't you been a bit on edge lately?

2
[Closeup of Sango giving Inuyasha a demonic glare.]
<Sango:    KI no sei daro.>
Sango: It is just your imagination.
Fx Sango: (comically) *glare* <giro>
Fx background: (comically) crackle <zukyu--n>

3
[Sango is just standing there, looking at Inuyasha, with comical flames
coming off her. Inuyasha is now hiding behind Kagome with a her in his eye,
and Kagome and Shippou are looking in confusion at Sango.]
Fx flames: (comically) roa-a-r <go--->
Fx flames: (comically) crackle crackle <bachi bachi>
<Kagome:    sa... SANGO-chan...?>
Kagome: Sa... Sango-chan...?
Fx Inuyasha: (comically) *hide* <koso_>

(    Inuyasha probably meant it as an innocent question, but the implication is
that Sango has been "on edge" over Miroku and Koharu's relationship...)

4
[Scene change to a view of the night sky.]
<Miroku:    dewa SONCHOU-sama,>
Miroku: So then, sonchou-sama,

Inuyasha, Kagome and Sango are standing a bit back.]
<village headman:    TOmatte ikaretemo kamawan no daga...>
village headman: Although you won't be staying no matter what [at least stay tonight]...
<Miroku:    ie...>
Miroku: No...



Page 17

[Closeup of Miroku looking a bit sad.]
<Miroku:    NAGAku TODOmareba...>

<Miroku:    sore dake KOHARU ni TSURAi OMOi o sase masu no de.>
Miroku: that will made it even harder for Koharu.

2
[Sango, Kagome and Inuyasha look off at Miroku and the headman.]
