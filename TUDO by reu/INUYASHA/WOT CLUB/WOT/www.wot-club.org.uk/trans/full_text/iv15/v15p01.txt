Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

[Another nice picture of Kagome - she's sitting on a wall, looking off to
the side with a slight smile. She's wearing some rather nice boots, a dark
mini-skirt, a thick belt, flower patterned t-shirt and a white jacket.
There's a bottle of mineral water to one side and she's holding a ruck-sack
on the other.]

[Kagome turns to look behind her as her two un-named friends come up behind
her - one with longish hair and a hair-band, and another with short hair.]

hair-band: Ah! Kagome!
<Kagome:    a... ohayo-.>

[A girl with long curley hair carrying a tennis racket runs to catch up to
Houjou as he cycles into school, and Houjou turns to look at the girl with
a smile.]

behind a bush.]
Fx girls: *seakily* <koso_>
<hair-band:    HOUJOU-kun mo manzara ja nasasou- da shi...>
hair-band: Houjou-kun doesn't seem annoyed either...
<short-hair:    do- sun no kagome.>
short-hair: What'll you do Kagome?

4
[Kagome seems slightly confused while her friends seem surprised.]
<Kagome:    dou tte...>
Kagome: Do what...?
<Kagome:    i- n-ja nai?>
Kagome: It's okay isn't it?
<hair-band:    chotto...>

<short-hair:    HOUttoitara torarechau kamo yo_.>

<short-hair:    AITE wa DARE na no_.>
short-hair: Who is he then!?

[Kagome responds angrily.]
<Kagome:    yamete yo mo_.>

<Shippou:    nazeka kagome to INUYASHA dake nan-ja.>
Shippou: can go through the Well.

2
[Closeup of Shippou looking a bit sad.]
<Shippou:    INUYASHA ga MUKAe ni Ikeba sumu koto ja to iu no ni...>
Shippou: If Inuyasha would go over, this could all be finished...

3
[Inuyasha is sitting on a wooden fence, and Kaede (who seems to be laying
out some herbs or something) looks at him.]
<Kaede:    Ikan no ka INUYASHA.>
Kaede: Why don't you go, Inuyasha.
<Inuyasha:    urusee_.>

Inuyasha: .oO(She's certainly no girl.).
<Kaede:    kisama BUREI na KOTO o KANGAete iru na.>
Kaede: You thinking something rude aren't you.

6
[View of the sky.]

<Miroku:    hai NARAnde kudasai.>
Miroku: Certainly, please stand in line.

<Miroku:    INUYASHA no SEIKAKU o KANGAenasai.>

<Inuyasha:    kagome no YAROU, yappari YURUsenee_.>
Inuyasha: .oO(That jerk Kagome, I'm not going to forgive her.).
<Inuyasha:    ayamaraseru!>
Inuyasha: .oO(I'll make her apologise!).

4
[Inuyasha jumps down into the Well.]
Fx Inuyasha: fwip <Ba_>

5
[View of a Wacdnalds (deliberate play on MacDonalds) near a train-station,
though you can't tell which.]
<hair-band:    HAKUJOUshinasai yo kagome.>
hair-band: {off} Confess up Kagome.
<hair-band:    do-yu- OTOKO to tsukiatte-ru no yo_.>
hair-band: Why kind of guy are you seeing?



Page 10
1
[Inside the resturant, Kagome is holding a soft-drink, and there is a tray
with chips and burgers nearby. Kagome looks a bit annoyed.]
<Kagome:    UTSUWA no CHIsai yatsu yo_.>
Kagome: He's a low-grade guy.

(    I'm not exactly sure what Kagome means here. Literally, she's saying that
Inuyasha is of low caliber - he doesn't have what it takes... to ber her
boyfriend, perhaps...?)

2
[Kagome continues on, looking annoyed, resting her chin on her hand.]
<Kagome:    RANBOU de wagamama de OKOrippokute.>
Kagome: He's violent, selfish, and offensive.
<hair-band and short-hair:    Yanki-...?>
hair-band and short-hair: .oO(A Yank...?).

(    Or Yankee - ie disparaging slang for an American...)

3
[Kagome continues on, not looking at her friends, and they edge back a bit.]
<Kagome:    shikamo sungoi Yakimochi-yaki.>
Kagome: He also gets really jealous.
<hair-band:    hee.>
hair-band: Hmm.

4
[View of Kagome's two friends who seem... unimpressed I think.]
<hair-band:    demo-, Yakimochi-yaku tte,>
hair-band: But, getting jealous means,
<hair-band:    SUki da tte koto desho-.>
hair-band: that he loves you doesn't it.
Fx hair-band: (sucking drink through straw) *suck* <ju~>
<short-hair:    sono HITO kagome hitoSUJI nan-da.>
short-hair: That person's devoted to you Kagome.
<short-hair:    Aho-rashi...>
short-hair: .oO(This is pathetic...).

5
[Kagome looks a bit depressed, and suddenly her friends sit up, shocked.]
<Kagome:    sore nara... GAMAN mo suru kedo...>
Kagome: If he was... then I could put up with the rest...
Fx hair-band: *twitch* <piku_>
<hair-band:    nani_.>
hair-band: What!?
Fx short-hair: *sit up with a jerk* <gu_>
<short-hair:    CHIGAu no_!?>
short-hair: He's not!?



Page 11
1
[Kagome continues, looking depressed, while her friends look on, stunned.]
<Kagome:    nanka MUKASHI SUki datta HITO no koto,>
Kagome: There was someone he loved a long time ago,
<Kagome:    WASUrerarenai mitai...>
Kagome: but it seems he can't forget about her...

2
[Closeup side view of Kagome.]
<Kagome:    sou yo, yoku KANGAetara...>

[View of Kikyou.]
<Kagome:    INUYASHA datte, KIKYOU no koto OMOikkiri hikizutte-ru ja nai.>
Kagome: .oO(Inuyasha is definately dragging out the situation with Kikyou.).

4
[Kagome continues some more, holding her hands together and looking off into
the distance, and her friends get even more surprised.]
<Kagome:    sore na no ni, atashi ni CHIKAzuku OTOKO KOROso- to suru no yo.>
Kagome: Not only that, but he tried to kill a guy who got close to me.
<hair-band:    chotto,>
hair-band: Hang on!
<short-hair:    nani soitsu.>
short-hair: Who is this guy!?

5
[The hair-banded girl speaks to Kagome forcefully.]
<hair-band:    kagome, nande sonna yatsu to tsukiatte n-no yo.>
hair-band: Kagome, why are you seeing a guy like that?
<Kagome:    e_.>
Kagome: Eh?



Page 12
1
[Kagome's friends get quite angry, banging the table.]
<hair-band:    WAKArenakya Dame yo sonna yatsu.>
hair-band: You gotta break up! That kinda guy is no good.
Fx hair-band: (table) thump <dan>
<short-hair:    mou ZETTAI Accha Dame_.>
short-hair: Don't you ever meet him again!

2
[Kagome seems a bit surprised.]
<Kagome:    e_ demo...>
Kagome: Eh? But...
<hair-band:    DAMAtte KIite rya, SAITEI YAROU ja nai no, soitsu.>
hair-band: Keep quiet and listen - he's the worst possible sort, isn't he.

3
[Closeup of Kagome's two friends, speaking to Kagome forcibly.]
<hair-band:    RANBOU de Wagamama nan desho!?>
hair-band: He's violent and selfish isn't he!?
<short-hair:    shikamo FUTAMATA kakete-ru nante_.>
short-hair: He's even also two-timing you!

4
[Kagome is a bit taken aback and looks a bit surprised.]
<Kagome:    so_...>
Kagome: Tha...
<Kagome:    sou nan dakedo...>
Kagome: That's true, but...
Fx Kagome: (heart) thump thump thump <doki doki doki>

5
[Kagome makes some points, looking a bit desperate.]
<Kagome:    de, demo, ii toko mo aru no yo.>
Kagome: Bu, but, he has some good points too.
<Kagome:    KEKKOU yasashii shi.>
Kagome: He's quite nice.
<Kagome:    TSUYOkute TAYOri ni naru shi.>
Kagome: He's strong and reliable too.
<short-hair:    kagome...>
short-hair: Kagome...



Page 13
1
[Kagome's two friends lean in, looking hesitant.]
<hair-band:    anta Dama-sarete-ru no yo...>
hair-band: .oO(You're being tricked...).
<hair-band:    soitsu no koto...>
hair-band: Do you...
Fx hair band: *timidly* <osoru osoru>
<short-hair:    SUki na no?>
short-hair: love him?

2
[Closeup of Kagome with a hard to read expression. She's thinking, and looks
a bit sad.]

3
[Kagome takes a drink, and her two friends look at each other.]
Kagome: ......
Fx Kagome: (soft drink) *suck through straw...* <ju---...>
<hair-band and short-hair:    SUki nan-da.>
hair-band and short-hair: .oO(She does love him.).

(    Silence means consent. By not answering, Kagome is pretty agreeing that she
does love Inuyasha and knows it, but (probably) doesn't really want to
admit it. I still think, and have for a while, that Kagome really waiting
for Inuyasha to be "free" (not have any lingering feelings for Kikyou)
before being more forward.)

4
[View of the Higurashi Shrine.]
Fx leaves: rustle... <Zawa...>

5
[View of Kagome's room, and the window is sliding open.]

<Inuyasha:    kagome no iiNIOi de IPPAI da...>
Inuyasha: .oO(Kagome's nice smell is all over...).

5
[Inuyasha reacts massively as Souta suddenly walks into the room, behind Inuyasha.]
Fx door: clunk <ban>
<Souta:    are_,>

Souta: Sure, that's great.
<Souta:    Kenka-shita wake ja nai n-da, FUTARI-tomo.>
Souta: There's no way you two would have had a fight.

5
[Closeup of Souta smiling widely.]
<Souta:    datte, nee-chan suggoku KIGEN WARUso- datta kara...>
Souta: Because, nee-chan was in a really bad mood...

6
[Inuyasha looks a bit depressed or worried.]
<Souta:    ...doushita no?>
Souta: ...What is it?
Inuyasha: ......

[Closeup of Inuyasha thinking.]
