Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

[Miroku charges forwards while Sango catches her boomerang on the return.]
<Miroku:    NARAKU!>

[Naraku stands calmly in front of Miroku and Sango, in his usual baboon pelt.]
<Naraku:    kukuku... KIta na.>
Naraku: Kukuku... You made it here then.
<Naraku:    HOUSHI... SANGO.>
Naraku: Houshi... Sango.
Fx Miroku: shh <Za_>

(    Reminder, Miroku can be referred to as a 'houshi' - lowish level Buddhist priest.)

4
[Miroku and Sango look somewhat angry.]
<Miroku:    naze YOUROUZOKU no MONO-tachi o KOROshita?>
Miroku: Why did you kill members of the Youkai-Wolf Tribe?

[Meanwhile, in the "garden" Kouga is making a rapid series of attacks
against Inuyasha, who is trying to protect his right arm.]

1
[Kouga jumps up into the air.]
Fx Kouga: fwip <Ba_>

2
[Kouga comes rushing down delivering a massive punch to Inuyasha's chest
(who'd been lying on the ground), the force of which kicks up the ground
around Inuyasha.]
<Kouga:    kore de Owari da!>
Kouga: This is the end!
Fx Kouga: (Inuyasha) wham <Doga_>

3
[Kagome shouts out in worry.]
<Kagome:    INUYASHA!>
Kagome: Inuyasha!



Page 12
1
[Long view of Kouga is the middle of a wide crater.]
Fx ground: rumble... <Goooo...>

[Closeup of Kouga pulling his fist out - there is blood on his fingers.]

doesn't seem conscious.]

[Kouga looks to the side at a voice.]
<Kagura:    KI ga HAreta?>
Kagura: {off} Feeling cheered up?
<Kagura:    MIGOTO NAKAMA no KATAKI o Utte sa.>

[Long view over the courtyard of a figure with a fan.]
Fx Kagura: *walking over ground...* <Saku...>

5
[View of Kagura smiling happily.]
Fx Kagura: *walking over ground...* <Saku...>
<Kagura:    OOKAMI no nii-san.>
Kagura: Well mister wolf.
<Kagura:    anta mo kore de OMOi NOKOsu koto nai daro.>
Kagura: Surely you have no regrests over this.

(    Kagura says "ookami no nii-san" which would literally translate as "older
brother wolf" but here 'nii-san' is used a a rather mocking way to address
a guy - Kouga in this case.)

6
[Closeup of Kagome realising something.]
<Kagome:    are wa...>
Kagome: .oO(That's...).

(    I don't think Kagome's referring to Kagura here, but probably something
else she's noticed - possibly something special about Kagura's fan.)



Page 14
1
[Kouga is now standing on the edge of the crater in which Inuyasha and
Kagome is in, a short distance in front of Kagura.]

[Kouga looks a bit confused.]
<Kouga:    ... nanda temee wa.>
Kouga: ... Who're you, bitch.

3
[Kagura answers with a smile and unfolds her fan.]
<Kagura:    atashi wa KAGURA.>
Kagura: I am Kagura.
<Kagura:    anta ni mo SAIGO no MAI o MAwasete ageru yo.>
Kagura: I'll have you dancing your final dance too.
Fx fan: *unfold...* <Para...>



Page 15
1
[The dead wolf-men rise up from the ground.]
Fx corpses: *slide...* <Zu...>
Fx corpses: ksh... <Za...>

2
[Kouga looks on in shock.]
<Kouga:    na_...>
Kouga: Wha...

3
[Kagura now stands surrounded by dead wolf-men, all leaning over like
they're being held up by the waist.]
<Kagura:    konna FUU ni ne...>
Kagura: In a way just like this...
<Kagura:    mottomo koitsu-ra SHInjatte-ru kedo ne.>
Kagura: this lot also died of course.

4
[Kouga is really angry.]
<Kouga:    temee ga_...>
Kouga: You did...!
Fx Kouga: *grind teeth...* <Giri...>

5
[Kouga rushes forwards angrily.]
<Kouga:    bu_KOROshita-ru!>

[Kouga falls to his knees.]
Fx Kouga: *loose strength...* <Gaku...>
<Kouga:    u... UGOkenee!?>
Kouga: .oO(Ca... can't move!?).

2
[Closeup of Kagura holding her face covering her face except her eyes.]
<Kagura:    kukuku...>
Kagura: Kukuku...
<Kagura:    UDE ni SHIKOnda, kakera no DOKU ga KIite kita ne.>
Kagura: Looks like the poisoned fragment you inserted into your arm, has started affecting you.

(    From Kagura's words, the timing of this seems to be a co-incidence.)

3
[Kagura holds up her fan.]
<Kagura:    ja, sorosoro ikou ka.>
Kagura: Right, about time I started eh.
Fx fan: waft... <Su...>

4
[Kagura makes a quick motion with her fan and suddenly a volley of huge
glowing arcs are rushing at Kouga, who tries to dodge as best he can.]
Fx fan: swish <Za_>
<Kagura:    FUUJIN no MAI.>
Kagura: Fuujin no Mai. (Dance of the Wind-Blades)
Fx blades: fwip-fwip-fwip-fwip <Babababa_>

[Splurts of blood come from several places over Kouga's body.]

has her bow and arrows btw, and has been clearly been drawn with them recently.]
<Kagome:    nanimokamo ano ONNA ga...>
Kagome: .oO(Everything is because that girl...).
<Kagome:    i... INUYASHA...>
Kagome: I... Inuyasha...

3
[Closeup of Inuyasha's face - doesn't appear to be conscious.]
<Kagome:    Okite...>
Kagome: [Please] get up...
<Kagome:    INUYASHA!>
Kagome: Inuyasha!
