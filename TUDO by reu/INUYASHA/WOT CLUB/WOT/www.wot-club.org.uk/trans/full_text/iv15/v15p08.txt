Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

[Closeup of the girl - she's all white, and carrying what looks like a
mirror. She has longish hair that covers the sides of her head (hiding her
ears) and in two flat bunches that fall in front of her shoulders. She has
two flowers in her hair and a blank expression, and her kimono fairly
plain, and rather like Inuyasha's.]

(    Kanna is a girl's name. You could perhaps literally translate it as
"godless" - there is a word "kanna-zuki", which is the tenth lunar month,
which is "the month the gods are all away at the Izumo shrine" according to
my dictionary.)
