Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

[Kagome, dressed up fashionably again, is walking along, dressed for
slightly colder weather, looking to her side and behind her with a hard to
read expression - as if she just remembered or realised something she was
slightly unhappy about.]

[Houjou suddenly walks into a school classroom, looking happy.]
Fx classroom: jabber jabber <doya doya>
<Houjou:    HIGURASHI GAKKOU KIte-ta no ka.>
Houjou: So you are coming back to school, Higurashi.
<Houjou:    KEKKAKU mou ii no!?>
Houjou: Is the tuberculosis better now!?

2
[View of the other students in the classroom looking over at Houjou, when
they were talking in pairs. It's probably during some kind of break between
lessons. A reminder - Houjou is in a different class to Kagome, so he
wouldn't necessarily know Kagome was back straight away.]

3
[Kagome looks up from her desk, where she is doing some studying.]
<Kagome:    HOUJOU-kun...>
Kagome: Houjou-kun...

4
[A little later, Kagome is standing in front of Houjou, looking slightly surprised.]
Fx desks: {in background} clatter <gatata_>
<Kagome:    EIGA?>
Kagome: A movie?
<Houjou:    un.>
Houjou: Yup.
<Houjou:    nanka SAIKIN yukkuri Au HIMA nakatta shi.
** 
>
Houjou: There hasn't been any good free time to meet recently.

[Kagome is looking a bit surprised and confused, and behind her is a drawing
of Houjou talking to that first-year girl, with an arrow pointing at the girl.]
<Kagome:    demo...>
Kagome: But...
<Kagome:    HOUJOU-kun, ICHINEN no JOUSHI to tsukiatte-ru n-ja...?>
Kagome: .oO(Houjou-kun, is [not] going out with a first-year student...?).

2
[Kagome is a bit wide-eyed as her two friends suddenly appear, one looking
sternly at Kagome, the other at Houjou.]
Fx hair-band: *zip* <Za_>
<hair-band:    Iku wa yo ne kagome_.>
hair-band: You will go, won't you, Kagome.
<Kagome:    e".>
Kagome: _Eh_.
<short-hair:    Ikitai tte.>
short-hair: {to Houjou} She said she wants to go.
<Houjou:    HONTOU!?>
Houjou: Really!?

3
[Houjou now turns to leave, smiling happily.]
<Houjou:    ja, KONDO no DOYOUBI na_.>
Houjou: Then, this Saturday, okay.

4
[Kagome seems slightly confused, while her friends look stern.]
<Kagome:    chotto, nani yo KATTE ni...>
Kagome: Hey, what's with deciding for me...
<short-hair:    kagome ni wa HOUJOU-kun mitai na Futsu- no HITO ga pittari na no_.>
short-hair: A normal guy like Houjou-kun is a perfect fit for you, Kagome!

5
[The friend with a hair-band raises an admonistory finger at Kagome, who
shrinks back, wide-eyed.]
<hair-band:    SHITTOBUKAi UE ni ONNA-GUSE no WARUi BOURYOKU OTOKO to, kono mammma tsukiattte-tara kagome no SHOURAI Mechakucha yo.
** SHITTOBUKAi UE = most jealous?
ONNA-GUSE no WARUi = bad habbit for women?
>
hair-band: Going out with the most jealous man is a typical mistake for women, and he's violent too, so if you go on like this, you future will be mucked up, Kagome.
<Kagome:    sore... INUYASHA no koto...?>
Kagome: .oO(That's... about Inuyasha...?).

[View of the Higurashi Shrine near evening.]
Fx leaves: rustle... <Sawa...>
<Kagome:    fu-.>
Kagome: {off} *sigh*

2
[Kagome, having just come back from school presumably, is looking down into
the Well.]
<Kagome:    INUYASHA mada OKOtte-ru daro- na...>
Kagome: .oO(Inuyasha's still angry I guess...).
<Kagome:    KEKKOU NEnimotsu Taipu dakara.>
Kagome: .oO(He is rather the type to hold a grudge, after all.).

3
[FlashBack Flashback to the scene two chapters ago. Again.
<Inuyasha:    mou temee no KAO nanka MItakune-_.>
Inuyasha: I don't want to look at you again!
EndFlashBack]

4
[Closeup side view of Kagome thinking.]

5
[View from inside the Well of Kagome turning and leaving.]
Fx Kagome: *turn* <kuru>
<Kagome:    Dame da.>
Kagome: No way.
<Kagome:    IMA MODOttara mata Kenka shiyou.>
Kagome: If I returned now, we'd have another fight.

[On the other side, Inuyasha is leaning over the side of the Well, looking
down, as if he's been there for some time.]
Fx leaves: rustle... <Sawa...>
Inuyasha: ......

2
[Inuyasha remembers what Souta said in the previous chapter.]
<Souta:    nee-chan, suggoku KIGEN WARUso- datta kara...>
Souta: Because nee-chan was in a really bad mood...

3
[Closeup of Inuyasha thinking.]

4
[Shippou suddenly turns up, giving Inuyasha an angry look.]
Fx Shippou: *pop up* <hyoi>
<Shippou:    iikagen MUKAe ni Ike INUYASHA.>
Shippou: Cut that out and go over there, Inuyasha.
<Shippou:    kagome wa YURUshite kureru.>
Shippou: Kagome will forgive you.

5
[Inuyasha gives Shippou a dry,annoyed look.]
<Inuyasha:    sore ja, marude ore ga WARUi mitai ja ne- ka.>
Inuyasha: If I did, it'd be like it was my fault, wouldn't it.

6
[Closeup of Shippou giving Inuyasha an angry look.]
<Shippou:    WARUi.>
Shippou: It is your fault.
<Shippou:    kagome no KOKORO o UTAGAtto-ru.>
Shippou: You doubted Kagome's feelings.

7
[FlashBack Yet another flashback to Kagome holding the injured Kouga in her arms.
<Kagome:    yamete.>
Kagome: Stop it.
<Kagome:    KOUGA-kun hidoi Kega shite-ru no yo.>
Kagome: Kouga-kun is badly injured.
EndFlashBack]



Page 6
1
[Inuyasha looks at Shippou sitting on the edge of the Well.]
<Shippou:    TASHIka ni kagome wa KOUGA o kabatte NIGAshita.>
Shippou: Kagome certainly did protect Kouga and let him escape.

2
[Closeup of Shippou.]
<Shippou:    YATSU ga INUYASHA no TEKI de,
'YATSU' has kanji for KOUGA
>
Shippou: Inspite of him being Inuyasha's enemy,
<Shippou:    sarawarete hidoime ni atta ni mo kakawarazu ja.>
Shippou: and also having a terrible time being kidnapped, though.

3
[Shippou is thinking on something, and Inuyasha is watching.]
Shippou: ......
Inuyasha: ......

4
[Shippou suddenly looks up at Inuyasha, who gets angry and frustrated.]
<Shippou:    yappari KOUGA no koto o SUki ni natte shimatta n-jaro ka?>
Shippou: I guess she did fall in love with Kouga after all?
<Inuyasha:    ore ni KIku na-_.>
Inuyasha: Don't ask me!

5
[View of the Higurashi house at night, with light coming out of a window.]

6
[Souta is is Kagome's room on her bed, with Buyo sitting on his lap. Kagome
is at her desk, studying.]
<Souta:    nee-chan,>
Souta: Nee-chan,
<Souta:    itsu made Iru no sa.>
Souta: what's keeping you here?
<Kagome:    nani yo,>
Kagome: What's with that,
<Kagome:    Icha WARUi?>
Kagome: is it bad me being here?



Page 7
1
[Kagome turns around to give Souta an annoyed look.]
<Kagome:    atashi wa JUKEN BENKYOU de ISOGAshii n-dakara ne_.>
Kagome: I'm busy studying for exams you know.
<Kagome:    ittsumo MUKOU ni Itte-ru wake ni ikanai no_.
'mukou' has kanji for Sengoku
>
Kagome: There's no way I can always stay over there!

2
[Souta continues to look at his sister, who has turned back to her studying.]
<Souta:    ittsumo Itte n-jan.>
Souta: When'll you be going.
<Kagome:    sore wa INUYASHA ga TSUreMODOshi ni kuru kara_...>
Kagome: When Inuyasha comes to take be back.

3
[Souta says something to Kagome, who has a shocked look. The T-shirt
Kagome's wearing has 'SHAM' written on it, and some panda footprint marks,
though this is probably not meant to mean anything in particular.]
<Souta:    KOnai ne.>
Souta: He's not coming, is he.
Fx Kagome: *twitch* <piku>
Fx Kagome: (pen in hand) crack <peki **?? guess>

4
[The background hs gone dark and meanacing, as Souta looks up, wide-eyed, as
Kagome looms over him, with a dark, threatening expression.]
<Souta:    ...urusakatta?>
Souta: ...I'm being a nuisance?
Fx Kagome:  <bo bo bo **??>
<Kagome:    ...DEtte tte.>
Kagome: ...Leave.

5
[View of an alarm clock ("classical" look, except it doesn't have two bells
on the top) on Kagome's desk. The time is 10:05.]
Fx clock: tick tick tick <Chi_ Chi_ Chi_>

6
[Kagome is having a pause in her studies, thinking with her head on her hands.]
<Kagome:    demo...>
Kagome: However...
<Kagome:    kore wa Chansu kamo shirenai.>
Kagome: this might be my only chance.

7
[Kagome turns back to her studying.]
Fx Kagome: *sit forward quickly* <gu_>
<Kagome:    sou yo IMA no uchi ni SUkoshi demo...>
Kagome: That's right, right now, for just a bit...
<Kagome:    BENKYOU OKUreta BUN TOrimodosa nakucha_.>
Kagome: I gotta get back on schedule in my studies!

(    In Japan, what is taught in school is all pre-planned centrally - ie there
is an official schedule of what should be taught when. This does make it
easier to Kagome to know what to study.)

Kagome: studying in the morning, would definately work better.

[Kagome tiredly swings her arm over to stop the alarm clock, not looking.]
<Kagome:    n~~~~>
Kagome: Hn~n~n~n

7
[Kagome looks in confusion at the place where her alarm was.]

Kagome: The alarm-clock's gone...?

[View of Houjou looking a bit surprised, while standing in a corridor.]
<Houjou:    e...>
Houjou: Eh...
<Houjou:    KYUUYOU?>

3
[Closeup of Kagome, hands together in apology.]
<Kagome:    un...>

<Kagome:    dakara DOYOUBI no EIGA, Ikenai no.>
Kagome: That's why I can't go to the movies, this Saturday.

4
[View of Kagome and Houjou standing in a corridor, both looking away from
each other.]
<Kagome:    gomen ne.>
Kagome: I'm sorry.
<Houjou:    sokka...>
Houjou: I see...

5
[Closeup of Kagome.]
<Kagome:    ano... dakara ne,>
Kagome: Ummm... so you see,
<Kagome:    WATASHI ni kamawanai de...>
Kagome: don't mind me and...

6
[Kagome speaks to Houjou, looking up at him.]
<Kagome:    ICHINENSEI no ONNA NO KO to ISSHOU ni Itte.>
Kagome: go along with the first year girl.
<Houjou:    e...?>

[Kagome looks slightly perplexed and Houhou leans towards her.]

<Houjou:    HIGURASHI...>
Houjou: Higurashi...



Page 14

[Closeup of Houjou looking pleased.]

<Houjou:    sonna koto KI ni shite-ta no!?>

<Houjou:    ore hoka no KO to tsukiau KI nai shi-.>
Houjou: I don't have any intention of going out with anyone else.

3
[Houjou turns away, looking slightly pleased/embarrassed, and Kagome just
watches in confusion.]
<Houjou:    sokka-,>
Houjou: So that's it,
<Houjou:    demo chotto UREshii na.>
Houjou: but I'm kinda happy though.

4
[Closeup of Houjou smiling happily.]
<Houjou:    HIGURASHI Yakimochi yaite kurete-ta n-da.>
Houjou: You've been jealous over me, Higurashi.

[Kagome forces a smile on her face, somewhat strained.]
<Kagome:    iya...>

Kagome: .oO(Houjou-kun is... strong.).
Fx Houjou: *invigorated* <sawayaka>
<Houjou:    mata SASOu kara_.>
Houjou: I'll invite you out again!

(    Kagome was, somewhat subtly, trying to tell Houjou to forget about her, but
it looks like Houjou isn't giving up easily... Also, Kagome would have
maybe liked to explained why she wasn't jealous, but it would have been awkward.)

[White frame.]
<Kagome:    INUYASHA mo ano kurai JISHIN MANMAN nara ii no ni...>
Kagome: .oO(It would be nice if Inuyasha has so much confidence too...).

5
[Closeup of Kagome, who's smiling.]
<Kagome:    ehehe.>
Kagome: Ehehe.
<Kagome:    KIchatta.>
Kagome: I'm back.

(    Kagome says this in a self-depreciating way that's hard to translate. Kinda
like the tone you'd use to say, "Haha, I goofed", almost.)

6
[Kagome is now sitting beside Inuyasha.]
Inuyasha: ......



Page 16

[Closeup of Kagome, with a smile.]

<Kagome:    MEZAmashi-DOKEI...?>

[Inuyasha looks away.]

<Inuyasha:    nani ga aru n-da yo.>
Inuyasha: anything else [I should apologise for]?

3
[Kagome looks a bit let down.]
<Kagome:    BETSU ni...>
Kagome: Not really...
<Kagome:    mo- ii ya.>
Kagome: .oO(Well, nevermind.).

4
[View of the sky.]
<Kagome:    sekkaku MODOtte KIta n-da mon.>
Kagome: {off} Now that I've finally come back...

5
[Kagome has snuggled up to Inuyasha slightly, looking content, while
Inuyasha just looks off.]
<Kagome:    soba ni ite ageru wa yo.>
Kagome: let me stay beside you.
<Inuyasha:    ke_.>
Inuyasha: Bah.


(    There's a one week break until the next chapter of Inuyasha. Next week in
Shonen Sunday will be a one-chapter short story by Takahashi-sensei called
"with CAT".)
