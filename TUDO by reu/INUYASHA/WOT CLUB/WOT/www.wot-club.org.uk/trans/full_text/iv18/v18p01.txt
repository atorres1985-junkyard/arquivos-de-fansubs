Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

[Inuyasha charges forwards, Tetsusaiga slung over his shoulder.]
<Inuyasha:    doitero YAseOOKAMI!>
Inuyasha: Outta the way, wimpy wolf!
Fx Inuyasha: *dash* <Da_>
<Inuyasha:    JUUROUMARU wa ore ga tata_KIru!!>
Inuyasha: I'll rip Juuroumaru apart!!

the weight on his shoulder.]

4
[Kouga throws some insults while passing by, in front of Inuyasha.]

[Closeup of Inuyasha, sweating a bit, and looking annoyed.]
<Inuyasha:    ...nishitemo kono JUUROUMARU...>

3
[Sango covers the base of the staff with the sticky liquid from the cup.]
<Sango:    kono DOKU... NAGAku wa KIkanai kedo,>

[View of Inuyasha sitting up, realising something.]
Inuyasha: !
<Inuyasha:    KAGEROUMARU no KEHAI ga... nee!?>
Inuyasha: .oO(Kageroumaru's _kehai_ has... gone!?).

(    'kehai' is often nasty to translate, and approximately means 'sign',
'indication', or 'presence'. In this context it's pretty much a 6th sense
type location sense. When Kagome says that she can feel the presence of a
Shikon fragment, she literally says that she can feel it's _kehai_.)

<Inuyasha:    MONOKAGE ni HISOnde iru no ka... sore tomo...>
