white text: For the TV series, the excellent staff of Producer Tomioka Hideyuki have precisely depicted the world of "Inuyasha" I think, but for our Commercial Theater version, we've deliberately done scenes with strong visual impact rather than follow the story (laughs).
<white text:    SOUDAI na SEKAIKAN no YOKOKU HEN mitai na mono ni nareba YOi naa to.>
white text: It would be nice if it seems like a preview of the magnificent world [of Inuyasha].
<white text:    KEKKA to shite, HON ga Ure TV Anime mo MItai na to OMOtte moraereba SAIKOU desu!!
** "omotte moraereba"??

white text: If as a result, the books sell and people want to see the TV Anime I think that would be great!!
