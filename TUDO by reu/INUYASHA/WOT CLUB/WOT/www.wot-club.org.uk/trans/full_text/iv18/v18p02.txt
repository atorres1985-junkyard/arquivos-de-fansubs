Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

[Inuyasha is in the foreground holding Tetsusaiga slightly down, teeth
gritted. Behind him is Kouga with a fist clenched, looking serious. To the
side and behind both is a large drawing of Kagome, looking worried.]

[Closeup of Juuroumaru with his mouth open, and dark liquid dripping from it.]
Fx liquid: *ooze...* <Doro...>

2
[Inuyasha has caught up and is now directly behind Kouga, but is angrily
swinging Tetsusaiga right at Kouga.]
<Inuyasha:    dokanee to temee mo...>
Inuyasha: Get outta the way or else...
<Inuyasha:    matomete tata_KIRU!>

Fx liquid: gloop <Gabo>

2
[Side view of the action. Kageroumaru has come out a foot from Juuroumaru's
mouth, and is about the same distance from Kouga almost hitting him with
his remaining claw. Right behind Kouga is Inuyasha with Tetsusaiga almost
hitting Kouga in the back, but the follow-through will clearly hit
Kageroumaru and Juuroumaru.]
Fx Kageroumaru: (claw) vish <Sha_>

[Closeup of Kageroumaru looking triumphant.]
<Kageroumaru:    kukuku... IMAGORO KIzuitemo OSOi!>
Kageroumaru: Kukuku... You've realised too late!

2
[Closeup of Inuyasha shouting.]
<Inuyasha:    yakamashii kono KAICHUU YAROU!>
Inuyasha: Shut up you wormy bastard!

3
[Kouga ducks out of the way, diving to the ground, in a panic, as Inuyasha
swings Tetsusaiga around powerfully.]
Fx Tetsusaiga: whoosh <Go_>
<Kouga:    uwa_.>
Kouga: Uwha!

[Closeup of Kageroumaru looking surprised as a powerful force cuts him down
the middle.]
Kageroumaru: !
Fx Kageroumaru: *rip* <Baba>



Page 7

[Juuroumaru and Kageroumaru are ripped apart by Tetsusaiga's 'kenatsu' - not
quite the full "Cutting Wind".]
Fx Juuroumaru and Kageroumaru: *rip* <Ba_>

[The others look on in surprise.]
<Kagome:    a...>
Kagome: Ah...
<Shippou:    KONAGONA ja.>
Shippou: Broken into bits.
<Miroku:    yatta...>
Miroku: Got them...

2
[Inuyasha looks on, and in the foreground several bits of Juuroumaru turn to
dust/mist. (been a while since I remember that happening to a Youkai when killed.)]
<Inuyasha:    Owa...tta...>
Inuyasha: .oO(It's... over...).
Fx :  <>

3
[Closeup of Inuyasha looking a bit weary.]
<Inuyasha:    _taku...>
Inuyasha: Sheesh...
<Inuyasha:    TEMAdorase yagatte...>
Inuyasha: Took fucking long enough...



Page 9
1
[Kouga has bopped Inuyasha on the head.]
<Kouga:    kono YAROU.>
Kouga: You jerk.
Fx Inuyasha: clunk... <mishi...>

2
[Kouga is glaring at Inuyasha angrily. Inuyasha's face is kinda comical but
hard to read - maybe something like "if only..."]
<Kouga:    temee, tsuide ni ore mo KOROsu KI datta daro.>
Kouga: You bastard, you used that opportunity to try to kill me too, didn't you.
Inuyasha: ......

3
[Kagome rushes up worriedly.]
Fx Kagome: *run* <Ta_>
<Kagome:    cho, chotto MAtte.>
Kagome: Wh, wait a sec.

4
[Kagome is standing next to Inuyasha, who is looking away, while she talks
to Kouga, who's quite angry.]
<Kouga:    ZEN__ZEN tamerawanee de, OMOi_kiri KATANA FURIoroshi yagatte.>
Kouga: Without _any_ hesitation _at all_, he irresolutely fucking swung the sword down.
<Kagome:    sore wa, KOUGA-kun no HAYAsa nara, ZETTAI yokete kureru to OMOtta kara...>
Kagome: That's because, he knew your speed Kouga-kun, and that you could definitely dodge it...

5
[Kagome turns to smile encouragingly at Inuyasha, who has turned away in annoyance.]
<Kagome:    desho? INUYASHA.>
Kagome: Isn't that right Inuyasha.
<Inuyasha:    _taku usse- YAse OOKAMI da ze.>
Inuyasha: Sheesh, whadda whining wimpy wolf.



Page 10
1
[Closeup of Inuyasha shouting angrily.]
<Inuyasha:    temee kore IJOU Gatagata nukasu to, KONDO wa HONKI de tata_KIRU zo!>
Inuyasha: If you keep up this racket any longer, next time I'll seriously rip you apart!

2
[Kouga rushes forwards to attack.]
<Kouga:    omoshiree, yareru mon nara yatte miro, kono kutabari zokonai!>
Kouga: Fine with me, if wanna piece of me just try it, you fucking zombie!
Fx Kouga: swish <Za_>

(    Kouga here calls Inuyasha "kutabari zokonai" which is an insult, but
literally translates as "failed to die", which is rather hard to turn into
an insult in English.)

3
[Closeup of Kagome shouting with her fists clenched.]
<Kagome:    INUYASHA osuwari_!>
Kagome: Inuyasha sit!

4
[Inuyasha crashes to the ground wide-eyed, while Kouga has stopped in
surprise. Kagome is kneeling next to Inuyasha looking back up at Kouga.]
Fx Inuyasha: {comically} *fall with a thud* <dosha>
<Kagome:    KOUGA-kun, kyou no tokoro wa HIkiagete.>
Kagome: Kouga-kun, you should withdraw for today.

5
[Closeup of Inuyasha shouting angrily.]
<Inuyasha:    nani shi-yaganda kagome-_!>
Inuyasha: Whadda fuck you do that for Kagome-e!?



Page 11
1
[Closeup of Kagome responding forcefully.]
<Kagome:    anta hidoi Kega shite n-no yo.>
Kagome: You're badly injured.
<Kagome:    kore IJOU TATAKAttari shitara...>
Kagome: If you carry on fighting then...

2
[Kagome is now talking seriously to Kouga, standing in front of him.
Inuyasha is looking up at them, annoyed.]
Fx Kagome: *yabber yabber* <pera pera pera>
<Kagome:    KOUGA-kun, HON_TOU kyou wa arigato.>
Kagome: Kouga-kun, I'm really grateful for what you did today.
<Kagome:    okage de suggoku TASUkatta wa, KANSHAshite-ru.>
Kagome: Thanks to you we were really saved - I'm grateful.

3
[Sango and Miroku are looking on.]
<Sango:    nanka... ZENZEN KOKORO ga komottenai mitai na...>
Sango: Somehow... it's seems like she's not sincere at all...
<Miroku:    konna koto de KOUGA ga HIkisagaru tomo OMOen ga...>
Miroku: I don't think that'll be enough to make Kouga withdraw...

4
[Kouga speaks to Kagome.]
Fx Kouga: *stare* <ji_>
<Kouga:    kagome...>
Kouga: Kagome...
<Kagome:    e...>
Kagome: Eh...

5
[Kouga has clasped Kagome's hands in his own, and she is edging back with a
forced smile.]
<Kouga:    omae wa ore no ONNA da.>
Kouga: You're my woman.
<Kouga:    YAKUTAtazu no INU_koro ni, makase_kiri ni shite okenee ja nee ka.>
Kouga: I can't always leave you with that useless dog-turd.
Fx Kouga: (Kagome's hands) *squeeze* <gyu_>
<Kagome:    haa...>
Kagome: Erm...

(    I'm really not sure about Kouga's line here... I'll try to get it fixed soon.)



Page 12
1
[Closeup of Inuyasha, still stuck to the ground, getting very (comically) angry.]
Fx Inuyasha: (veins popping) *snap snap* <biki biki biki>
<Inuyasha:    onore, Iwasete okeba~>
Inuyasha: .oO(You arsehole, you don't know went to stop!).

2
[Kouga makes to leave, looking happy and waving back.]
<Kouga:    omae ga ABUnee TOKI wa, KANARAzu ore ga TASUke ni KUru ze.>
Kouga: When you get into danger, I'll definitely come to save you.
Fx Kouga: shh <Za_>
<Kouga:    jaa na_.>
Kouga: So long!

3
[Kouga disappears in a whirlwind, and Kagome is waving to him cheerily
(looking a bit force), and Miroku, Sango and Shippou watch looking a bit surprised.]
Fx whirlwind: whizz... <gyurururu>
<Kagome:    ja- ne-.>
Kagome: See you!
<Miroku:    a.>
Miroku: Ah.
<Sango:    KAEtta...>
Sango: He left...

4
[Kagome looks on in surprise as Inuyasha gets up angrily, looking off in the
direction Kouga went.]
Fx Inuyasha: *sit up suddenly* <gaba>
<Inuyasha:    MAchi yagare teme-_.>
Inuyasha: Wait you fucking bastard!

5
[Kagome causes Inuyasha to splat to the ground again - she looks annoyed and determined.]
<Kagome:    osuwari_.>
Kagome: Sit!
Fx Inuyasha: squish <gusha>
<Inuyasha:    gue.>
Inuyasha: Gerk.

6
[Closeup of Inuyasha looking a bit fed-up.]
<Inuyasha:    ...temee, mata KOUGA o NIgashi yagatta na...>
Inuyasha: ... You bitch, fucking letting Kouga escape again...



Page 13
1
[Kagome speaks to Inuyasha, who responds angrily.]
<Kagome:    datte, INUYASHA sono KARADA ja...>
Kagome: But Inuyasha, in that condition you'll...
<Inuyasha:    ore ga anna YAseOOKAMI ni MAkeru to OMOtte n-no ka-_.>
Inuyasha: Did you think I'd loose to that wimpy wolf!?

2
[Quiet moment between the two.]
Kagome: ......

3
[Closeup of Kagome smiling encouragingly.]
<Kagome:    ne, tonikaku KIZU no TEAte o...>
Kagome: Say, at any rate, those wounds need looking at...

4
[Closeup of Inuyasha looking annoyed.]
<Inuyasha:    iranee_ tsutte n-daro.>
Inuyasha: I already said I don't need it, didn't I.
<Inuyasha:    daitai nanda~? sakki no TAIDO.>
Inuyasha: Besides, what was with that attitude earlier?

5
[Closeup of Kagome, looking surprised.]
<Inuyasha:    anna yatsu no KIGEN totte KOBI Uri yagatte.>
Inuyasha: {off} Sucking up to and fucking flirting with a guy like that.

6
[Inuyasha continues talking looking a bit fed-up, but is looking away from
Kagome (who isn't shown) and not paying attention.]
<Inuyasha:    _taku, mittomonakute MIterarenakatta ze.>
Inuyasha: Sheesh, I couldn't watch such shamefulness.
<Inuyasha:    daitai ome- wa na-...>
Inuyasha: Besides which, you're such...



Page 14
1
[Inuyasha is suddenly looking rather (comically) worried - he should be.
Behind him Kagome is just sitting there, but she and the background have
gone very dark and menacing.]
Fx scene: rumble... <Gogogogo...>
Kagome: ......
Fx Inuyasha: urkk <biku_>

(    Of course, Kagome is angry because it's for Inuyasha's sake that she did
what she did with Kouga, and he doesn't get it at all (again).)

2
[Inuyasha edges away from Kagome looking flustered, and she just watches him
with a flat look.]
Fx Inuyasha: (heart) thump-thump <doki doki doki>
<Inuyasha:    na, nanda temee sono ME wa.>
Inuyasha: Wh, what's with that expression you bitch.

3
[Closeup of Kagome looking a bit fed-up.]
<Kagome:    atashi KAEru.>
Kagome: I'm going.

4
[Inuyasha suddenly looks worried.]
<Inuyasha:    na...>
Inuyasha: Wha...

5
[Kagome and Inuyasha shout at each other.]
<Kagome:    JIKKA ni KAEru-_.>
Kagome: I'm going _home_!
<Inuyasha:    o~~ KAEre_,>
Inuyasha: So~o~o, go then!
<Inuyasha:    ore wa TOmenee zo.>
Inuyasha: I won't stop you.

6
[Miroku and Sango interrupt, both with a "ah, hello?" kinda look and Kagome
and Inuyasha look slightly embarrassed.]
<Miroku:    HANASHI ga matomatta tokoro de, Iki masu ka.>
Miroku: Now that you've finished talking, shall we leave?
<Sango:    HOUSHI-sama no KIZU no TEAtemo chanto shitai shi-.>
Sango: Houshi-sama would like to see his wounds properly tended to.

[Closeup side view of Naraku.]
<Naraku:    fun...>
Naraku: Humph...
<Naraku:    kisama wa YUDAN ga naran kara na.>
Naraku: I have to be careful about you.



Page 17

[Closeup of Kikyou with a slight smile.]
<Kikyou:    naraba WATASHI o KOROseba ii darou.>
Kikyou: Then why don't you kill me.

Kikyou: At any rate, inside of you...

3
[Closeup of Kikyou, with a sort of cold/unhappy expression. (or she just
being serious?)]
<Kikyou:    WATASHI ga KANGAete iru IJOU ni...>
Kikyou: it seems Onigumo's feelings...
<Kikyou:    ONIGUMO no KOKORO ga TSUYOku NOKOtte iru rashii na.>
