Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

she's just had a bath), and she looks fairly happy. Buyo the cat is sitting
on the bed looking at her, and the clock next to the bed reads 2:55.]

<Kikyou:    WATASHI no KARADA o ano BASHO e...>
Kikyou: take my body to that place...
Inuyasha: ......

(    Kikyou does literally say "my body" (instead of "me"), which isn't how
you'd normally put it in Japanese either.)

2
[Scene change to the modern world at night - view of the urban area.]

3
[In her room, Kagome is lying on her bed, asleep (wearing the same dress as
she was on the title page) with a towel under her head. Looks like she fell
asleep accidentally. Beside her bed is a medical kit, bandages and her bag.]
Fx Kagome: *breathe in softly...* <su--...>

4
[Kagome eyes open.]
<Kagome:    n...?>
Kagome: Hn...?

Kagome frantically packs stuff into her bag.]
<Kagome:    mo~_, nande Okoshite kurenai no~?>
Kagome: Sheesh! Why didn't anyone wake me up?
<Souta:    tte, mada NEte-ta no ka.>
Souta: Er, were you already asleep?

3
[Scene change back to Inuyasha and Kikyou. They're at the tree where
Inuyasha was shot to the tree by Kikyou. There's a patch of bark missing
from the tree, and around it are several of Kikyou's insects carrying Dead Souls.]
<Kikyou:    GOJUU NEN MAE.... kono BASHO de...>
Kikyou: 50 years ago... at this place...

[Closeup of Kikyou.]
<Kikyou:    WATASHI wa omae no MUNE o YA de INUki...>
Kikyou: I shot an arrow through your chest...
<Kikyou:    soshite WATASHI mo ZETSUMEIshita...>
Kikyou: and my life ended as well...

2
[Inuyasha looks at Kikyou in his arms, a bit surprised.]
<Inuyasha:    aa...>
Inuyasha: Yeah...
<Inuyasha:    KIKYOU... nande IMA sonna KOTO o...>
Inuyasha: .oO(Kikyou... why are you bringing this up now...?).

3
[Kikyou continues.]
<Kikyou:    INUYASHA...>
Kikyou: Inuyasha...
<Kikyou:    naze NARAKU wa omae to WATASHI o WANA ni kake... NIKUshimi awaseta to OMOu...>
Kikyou: why do you think Naraku caught you and I in a trap... and made us hate each other...
<Inuyasha:    sore wa...>
Inuyasha: That's...

4
[Closeup side view of Inuyasha.]
<Inuyasha:    SHIKON no TAMA o KEGAsu tame da.>
Inuyasha: To corrupt the Shikon no Tama.
<Inuyasha:    TAMA o KIYOmeru omae no KOKORO o, ore e no NIKUshimi de SOmeru tame ni...>
Inuyasha: By tainting your heart, which keeps the Jewel cleansed, with hatred for me...

5
[Closeup of Kikyou with a smirk.]
<Kikyou:    fun...>
Kikyou: Humph...
<Kikyou:    sonna koto... IiNOGOre ni sugin.>
Kikyou: That's... just an excuse.
<Kikyou:    WATASHI no KOKORO o KEGAsazu tomo...>
Kikyou: Even without corrupting my heart...



Page 12

[Drawing of the full Shikon no Tama except it looks mostly black.]
<Kikyou:    JAKI no KATAMARI NARAKU ga, sono TE ni SHIKON no TAMA o MOtsu dake de,>
Kikyou: {voice over} if Naraku just touched the Shikon no Tama, that should have been enough,
<Kikyou:    TAMA o KEGAsu ni wa juubun datta hazu.>
Kikyou: to corrupt the Jewel.

2
[Closeup side view of Inuyasha looking surprised.]
<Inuyasha:    KIKYOU... nani o Iou to shite iru!?>
Inuyasha: .oO(Kikyou... why are you trying to say!?).

3
[Closeup of Kikyou looking a little sad.]
<Kikyou:    NARAKU no NAKA ni NOKOtta ONIGUMO no KOKORO ga...>
Kikyou: The remains of Onigumo's heart inside Naraku...
<Kikyou:    WATASHI-tachi o HIkiSAita no da.
** very useage is a bit weird here. Doesn't say '-tai' (wanted) directly, but that seems the best meaning...
>
Kikyou: wanted us broken up.

4
[Inuyasha is surprised, and behind him is a drawing of Onigumo.]
<Inuyasha:    ONIGUMO no KOKORO...!?>
Inuyasha: Onigumo's heart...!?

5
[Side view of Kikyou and Inuyasha - who gets even more shocked.]
<Kikyou:    ano YATOU wa... WATASHI o JIBUN no ONNA ni shitagatte ita.
** literal translation of "wanted me to be his own woman" is a bit clumsy in english. I think "wanted me for himself" is equivilant in this case.
>
Kikyou: That wild-thief... wanted me for himself.
Inuyasha: !

[Drawing of when Kikyou shot Inuyasha at the tree.]

[Closeup of Inuyasha.]
<Inuyasha:    SHITTO tte...>
Inuyasha: "Jealousy"...?
<Inuyasha:    sonna kudaranee koto de...>
Inuyasha: What a meaningless reason to...

3
[Kikyou looks off into the distance and Inuyasha looks at her in thought.]
<Kikyou:    sou da, kudaran.>
Kikyou: Yes, it's meaningless...
<Kikyou:    soshite... sore ga NINGEN da.>
Kikyou: and also... very human.
Inuyasha: ......

[Inuyasha talks intensely to Kikyou.]
<Inuyasha:    NARAKU no NAKA ni ONIGUMO no KOKORO ga NOKOtte iru...!?>
Inuyasha: .oO(Onigumo's heart remains inside Naraku...!?).
<Inuyasha:    MAte KIKYOU.>
Inuyasha: Wait a sec, Kikyou.
<Inuyasha:    sore ja, NARAKU wa omae no koto...>
Inuyasha: Then, Naraku's feelings for you...

2
[Drawing of Naraku in a forest (with the baboon pelt off) looking
disgruntled - perhaps a flashback from the latest meeting with Kikyou.]
<Kikyou:    yatsu wa MITOmetakunai darou ga na...>
Kikyou: {voice over} He probably doesn't want to admit it, but...
<Kikyou:    dou yara WATASHI e no OMOi ga NOKOtte iru rashii...>
Kikyou: at any rate, it seems those feelings for me remain...

3
[Closeup of Kikyou looking a bit sad.]
<Kikyou:    sono OMOi o UchiKEsou to shite...>

Fx Kikyou: *push...* <Gu...>

Inuyasha: Kikyou!

2
[Closeup of Inuyasha shouting.]
<Inuyasha:    omae... hitori de NARAKU o HORObosou to shite-ru n-daro.>
Inuyasha: You're... intending to destroy Naraku by yourself, aren't you.
<Inuyasha:    sonna no dame da.>
Inuyasha: That's no good.

3
[Kikyou talks to Inuyasha somewhat coldly.]
<Kikyou:    INUYASHA... WATASHI wa MIKO da.>
Kikyou: Inuyasha... I am a miko.
<Kikyou:    yatsu o KANZEN ni KEshiSAru ni wa, WATASHI no REIRYOKU de TATAKAu koto ga...>
Kikyou: By fighting with my spiritual powers, I can completely remove him [from this world]...
<Inuyasha:    sonna koto Itte-ru n-ja nee_.>
Inuyasha: I'm not talking about that!

4
[Closeup of Inuyasha, looking away from Kikyou.]
<Inuyasha:    ano NARAKU ga omae ni HOrete-ru nante...>
Inuyasha: That someone like Naraku is in love with you...

<Inuyasha:    ore no INOCHI wa omae no mono da to Itta.>

[Inuyasha hugs Kikyou tightly.]
<Inuyasha:    NARAKU nanzo ni... omae o WATAshite tamaru ka!>
Inuyasha: There's no way I'll hand you over... to the likes of Naraku!
<Kikyou:    INUYASHA...>
Kikyou: Inuyasha...

2
[Nearby, Kagome gets out of the Well, swing her bag over onto the ground.
She's in her school uniform now.]
Fx Kagome: *pop up* <hyoi>
Fx bag: thunk <Dosa>
<Kagome:    a-n.>

[Closeup of Kagome looking surprised.]
<Kagome:    e...!?>
Kagome: .oO(Eh...!?).

[Kagome is hiding behind a tree looking around it in surprise to see
Inuyasha and Kikyou hugging each other, neither of them looking up.]
Fx Kagome: shh... <Za...>
Kagome: !

4
[Closeup of Kagome looking a bit mortified.]
