Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

[Kikyou stands a short distance away from Naraku in his castle.]
<Kikyou:    NARAKU kisama...>
Kikyou: Naraku...

2
[Closeup of Kikyou with a slight smile.]
<Kikyou:    WATASHI o KOROshi saesureba, ONIGUMO no KOKORO kara...>
Kikyou: did you think that if you were able to kill me, you'd be able to...
<Kikyou:    WATASHI o SHITAu KOKORO kara NOGArerareru to OMOtte ita no ka?>
Kikyou: escape from Onigumo's heart which yearns for me huh?

3
[View of Naraku, who just looks at Kikyou.]
<Naraku:    ...dattara dou shita.>
Naraku: ...So what if I did.

4
[Kikyou draws an arrow in her bow calmly.]
<Kikyou:    fu_, kisama ga WATASHI no INOCHI o NERAu nado...>
Kikyou: Heh, to try take my life...
Fx bow: *strain...* <Kiri...>

[Kikyou releases the arrow in a flash of light, though Naraku doesn't react.]
<Kikyou:    HYAKUNEN HAYAi!>
Kikyou: you're 100 years too early!
Fx arrow: pow <Bashi>

(    This is one of those interesting Japanese phrases that are pretty much
impossible to translate. It's basically a declaration that the opponent is
basically so weak/unskilled that trying to attack is just laughable. Jaken
uses this to insult some (dead) robbers who attacked Sesshoumaru in volume
13, part 8. btw, it's a bit hard to fit into the translation, but Naraku
and Kikyou are both calling each other with 'kisama' ('you', very rudely)
all the time.)

2
[White frame.]
Fx sound: wham <Doga>

3
[Naraku's right arm has been vapourised (again), though he doesn't look too bothered.]
Fx Naraku: (arm) pow <Ba_>



Page 4
1
[Closeup of Naraku with a smile.]
<Naraku:    fun... KIKYOU, kisama mo tonda kuwase MONO da na.>
Naraku: Humph... Kikyou, you're also a real charlatan.
<Naraku:    shiorashiku INUYASHA no UDE ni sugatte ita ka to OMOeba...>
Naraku: I had thought you'd obidiently rely on Inuyasha's strength...
<Naraku:    sono ASHI de kono SHIRO ni norikonde kuru.>
Naraku: and come into this castle together.

2
[Closeup of Kikyou, with a slightly annoyed look.]
<Kikyou:    WATASHI ga INUYASHA ni SUKUwareta tokoro o, nozoki MIte ita no ka.>
Kikyou: You were peeping in on me when I was saved by Inuyasha huh.
<Kikyou:    GESU ga...>
Kikyou: You scum...

3
[Closeup of Naraku, looking serious again.]
<Naraku:    fun, kisama no SHI o MITODOkeyou to shita made.>
Naraku: Humph, only until I'd made certain of your death.
<Naraku:    KIKYOU kisama...>
Naraku: Kikyou...

4
[View of two large pots, one of which has a strong glow coming from the top.]
<Naraku:    BUJI ni koko kara KAEreru to OMOtte iru no ka.>
Naraku: {off} did you think I'd let you go safely home, huh?
Fx pot: glub... <Gobo...>

5
[A vaguely humanoid creature crawls out of the pot.]
Fx youkai: *slide...* <Zuru...>



Page 5
1
[The new Youkai slides out of the pot, onto the floor. It has a thick
snake-like body, but a vaguely humanoid torso - it has some white hair on
it's head, blank eyes, and tendrils around it's mouth.]
Fx youkai: (hitting floor) thunk <Do_>

2
[The Youkai shoots out a long tongue.]
Fx tongue: swish <Sha>

3
[The tongue wraps around Kikyou's leg.]
Fx tongue: (leg) slap <Pashi>

4
[Closeup of Kikyou, barely glancing at it.]



Page 6
1
[A large crackling energy sphere forms around Kikyou, without any obvious
effort on her part, and the Youkai is disintegrated and ripped apart by it.]
Fx barrier: crackle <Bachi>
Fx youkai: sizzle <Ju_>
Naraku: !

2
[Closeup of Kikyou looking at Naraku.]
<Kikyou:    kono YOUKAI wa kisama no BUNSHIN...>
Kikyou: This Youkai was your offspring...
<Kikyou:    wakaru ka? NARAKU.>
Kikyou: Do you understand, Naraku?

3
[Closeup of the scattered remains of the Youkai.]
<Kikyou:    kisama mo WATASHI ni YUBI IPPON demo FUretara kou naru.>
Kikyou: {off} If you lay even a single finger on me, this will happen to you as well.
Fx remains: hshht... <Shu---...>

4
[Closeup of Naraku, looking somewhat surprised.]
<Naraku:    YOUKI ga KEshiTOnda.>
Naraku: .oO(The _Youki_ was blown away.).
<Naraku:    KEKKAI...!?>
Naraku: .oO(A barrier...!?).



Page 7
1
[Another flashback drawing to Onigumo lying unmoving on a pallet in the cave.]
<Kikyou:    NARAKU...>
Kikyou: Naraku...
<Kikyou:    kisama ga YATOU ONIGUMO datta KORO ni, YOKOtawatte ita HORAANA no TSUCHI ni wa...>
Kikyou: when you _used to be_ wild-thief Onigumo, in the cave in which you laid down...

2
[Closeup of Kikyou, explaining.]
<Kikyou:    WATASHI e no asamashii MOUSHUU ga tappuri to shimikonde ita.>
Kikyou: plenty of his despicable delusions for me soaked into the earth.

3
[Closeup of Naraku.]
<Naraku:    HORAANA no TSUCHI o MI ni tsukete iru no ka.>
Naraku: So you put earth from the cave into your body huh.

4
[Closeup of Kikyou.]
<Kikyou:    sou da.>
Kikyou: Right.
<Kikyou:    ONIGUMO wa WATASHI no SHI nado NOZOnde wa inakatta.>
Kikyou: Onigumo didn't wish for my death at all.
<Kikyou:    sono KOKORO ga WATASHI no MI o MAMOru.>
Kikyou: Those feelings protect my body.

5
[View of Naraku, getting some bad news it seems.]
<Kikyou:    TSUCHI no KEKKAI ni FUretara SAIGO, ONIGUMO no KOKORO ga NAGArekomi,>
Kikyou: {off} Once you touch the barrier of earth, there's a rush of Onigumo's feelings,
<Kikyou:    NARAKU, kisama no YOURYOKU o UBAiSAru.>
Kikyou: and so Naraku, your Youkai power is taken away.



Page 8
1
[Closeup of Kikyou with a somewhat nasty grin.]
<Kikyou:    OBOete oke NARAKU.>
Kikyou: Remember this Naraku.
<Kikyou:    kisama wa WATASHI o KOROsenai.>
Kikyou: You can't kill me.
<Kikyou:    kisama ga NINGEN no KOKORO o NOKOsuKAGIri...>
Kikyou: Not as long as your human heart remains...
<Kikyou:    HANYOU de aru KAGIri.>
Kikyou: Not as long as you're a Half-Youkai.

2
[Kikyou leaves.]
Fx Kikyou: swish... <Za...>
<Naraku:    HANYOU de aru KAGIri--->
Naraku: .oO(Just be a Half-Youkai.).

3
[Closeup of Naraku giving Kikyou a nasty look.]
<Naraku:    sou da, dakara koso...>
Naraku: .oO(That's right, which is exactly why...).
<Naraku:    washi wa YOUKAI ni narou to shite iru.>
Naraku: .oO(I'm trying to become a [pure] Youkai.).



Page 9
1
[View of the Shikon no Tama, looking black.]
<Naraku:    SHIKON no TAMA o KANSEIsase,>
Naraku: .oO({off} I'll make the Shikon no Tama complete,).
<Naraku:    kono kudaran NINGEN no KOKORO o KEshiSArou to...>
Naraku: .oO(and then I'll completely get rid of this useless human heart...).

2
[Closeup side view of Naraku.]
<Naraku:    soshite sono TOKI ni wa KIKYOU...>
Naraku: .oO(and when that times comes Kikyou...).

3
[Drawing of Kikyou, with a smile.]
<Naraku:    SAISHO ni kisama o KUroute yaru.>
Naraku: .oO(I'll eat you first.).

(    I think Kikyou is counting on this - is make Naraku collect all the
fragments, complete the Shikon no Tama, then destory him and the Shikon no
Tama when he attacks. (Rather risky/daring strategy I must say, though
maybe she has some more aces up her sleeve.))



Page 10
1
[Scene change to a view of a village. It looks like morning.]
<Kagome:    etto ne, kore wa KANOUDOme.>
Kagome: {off} Let's see, this will stop festering.
<Kagome:    Ga-ze to HOUTAI mo takusan MOtte kita kara.>
Kagome: I've brought lots of gauzes and bandages.

2
[Inside Kaede's house, Kagome, Sango and Miroku are sitting around the
hearth in the middle. Sango is holding a large medicine box, and there's a
pile of stuff on the floor. Kagome has a hand to Shippou's head, who is
sleeping on the front just in front of Kagome.]
Fx Shippou: *snooze* <ka->
<Kagome:    sa, sore ja atashi Iku ne.>
Kagome: Okay, I'm going home now.
<Sango:    e... kagome-chan.>
Sango: Eh... Kagome-chan.
<Miroku:    mata KUNI ni KAEru to?>
Miroku: You're going back to your country again?

3
[Closeup of Kagome - hard to describe her face, but she looks sort of
embarrassed and regretful.]
<Kagome:    a, un.>
Kagome: Er, yeah.
<Kagome:    KUSURI TODOke ni KIta dake dakara...>
Kagome: I just went to get some medicine...

4
[Closeup of Sango and Miroku.]
<Sango:    ano sa... semete INUYASHA to NAKANAOri shitettara?>
Sango: You know... shouldn't you at least make up with Inuyasha?
<Sango:    tsumannai Kenka nanda shi.>
Sango: It's a silly fight.

5
[Another hard to explain expression from Kagome. She seems to have a slight
smile though it looks a bit forced.]
<Kagome:    a... sou ka atashi,>
Kagome: .oO(Oh... that's right,).
<Kagome:    INUYASHA to Kenka-shite-ta n-dakke...>
Kagome: .oO(I had a fight with Inuyasha, didn't I...).



Page 11
1
[Closeup side view of Kagome looking a bit sad.]
<Kagome:    sukkari WASUrete-ta...>
Kagome: .oO(I'd completely forgotten...).

2
[FlashBack Flashback to Inuyasha and Kikyou hugging. (I guess we might see this flashback quite a bit...)
<Inuyasha:    KIKYOU! NARAKU kara omae o MAMOreru no wa...>
Inuyasha: Kikyou! I'm the only one...
<Inuyasha:    ore shika inee ja nee ka.>
Inuyasha: who can protect you from Naraku, aren't I.
EndFlashBack]

3
[Misty frame. (time passes)]

4
[View of some grass.]

5
[Sango and Miroku are at the Well - Sango is looking in, and Miroku (who
still has his arm in a sling) is setting on the lip, facing away.]
<Sango:    nee HOUSHI-sama.>
Sango: Say houshi-sama.
<Sango:    kagome-chan, GENKI nakatta ne.>
Sango: Kagome-chan didn't look too happy did she.
<Miroku:    haa...>
Miroku: Yeah...

6
[Side view of Miroku and Sango.]
<Miroku:    maa...>
Miroku: Well...
<Miroku:    KENTOU ga tsukandemonai desu ga.>
Miroku: I not that I have no idea though.



Page 12
1
[View of Inuyasha walking about of the forest.]
Fx Inuyasha: *walking over ground...* <Saku...>

2
[Miroku gets up looking serious.]
<Sango:    INUYASHA...>
Sango: Inuyasha...
Fx Miroku: shh... <Za...>

3
[Closeup of Inuyasha looking slightly surprised.]
<Inuyasha:    a...>
Inuyasha: Oh...

4
[Miroku comes over to talk to Inuyasha.]
<Miroku:    INUYASHA,>
Miroku: Inuyasha,
<Miroku:    kagome-SAMA wa mata KUNI ni KAEtta zo.>
Miroku: Kagome-sama has gone back to her country again.
Inuyasha: ......

5
[Closeup side view of Inuyasha without much expression, though he has his
head down.]
<Inuyasha:    sou ka..>
Inuyasha: I see...

6
[Closeup of Miroku looking serious.]
<Miroku:    INUYASHA omae...>
Miroku: Inuyasha...
<Miroku:    KIKYOU-sama to Atte ita na?>
Miroku: you met Kikyou-sama, didn't you?



Page 13
1
[View of Miroku, with Sango behind him looking surprised.]
<Sango:    e...!?>
Sango: Eh...!?
<Miroku:    sono GENBA o kagome-SAMA ni MIrareta.>
Miroku: Kagome-sama saw that scene.
<Miroku:    CHIGAu ka?>
Miroku: Am I wrong?

2
[Closeup of Inuyasha answering calmly, and pretty much expressionlessly.]
<Inuyasha:    un...>
Inuyasha: Yeah...
<Inuyasha:    MIrareta.>
Inuyasha: She saw.

3
[Miroku and Sango look at Inuyasha in some surprise.]
<Sango:    ...tte, anta,>
Sango: ...hey you,
<Sango:    nani Nukenuke to...>
Sango: how shameless...
Miroku: ......

4
[Miroku is staring right at Inuyasha, their heads almost touching, and
Miroku almost seems angry, while Inuyasha seems calm/unresponsive.]
<Miroku:    INUYASHA, omae KAO ga HOTOKE-SAMA mitai ni natte-ru zo.>
Miroku: Inuyasha, your face seems to have become Buddha's.
<Miroku:    nanda? sono Sukkiri-shita SATOtta mitai na Tsura wa.>
Miroku: What's with the look as if you've attained complete enlightenment?
<Inuyasha:    sou MIeru ka.>
Inuyasha: Is that how I look?

(    Umm, well, that seems to be the literal translation. Just seems to be a way
of expression that Inuyasha looks permanently calm and unsurprised - as if
he expected everything.)



Page 14
1
[Scene change to a view of a modern city-scape - it seems to be close to evening.]

2
[View of Kagome sitting on her bed in her room. An overlaid closeup side
view of her shows her thinking, looking a bit sad - she has her head down.]

3
[FlashBack Flashback to when Inuyasha was staring constantly at Kagome.
<Kagome:    ano TOKI...>
Kagome: .oO({voice-over} At that time...).

4
[View of Inuyasha, expressionless.]
<Kagome:    INUYASHA wa WATASHI kara ME o sorasanakatta.>
Kagome: .oO({vo} Inuyasha wouldn't look away from me.).
EndFlashBack]



Page 15
1
[FlashBack Flashback continues, slightly more distant view of Inuyasha.
<Kagome:    nanika Iou to shite-ta kedo...>
Kagome: .oO({vo} He seemed to be trying to say something...).
EndFlashBack]

2
[View of Kagome's hands, gripping the bed-sheets.]
<Kagome:    WATASHI KIku no ga kowakute NIge dashita.>
Kagome: .oO(I was scared to ask and ran off.).

3
[Closeup of Kagome looking sad.]
<Kagome:    INUYASHA wa mou,>
Kagome: .oO(Because Inuyasha,).
<Kagome:    KImete shimatta n-da.>
Kagome: .oO(had already decided.).

4
[Drawing of when Kikyou shot Inuyasha to the tree.]
<Kagome:    INUYASHA to KIKYOU wa, NARAKU no WANA de NIKUshimiai...>
Kagome: .oO(Inuyasha and Kikyou, were brought into hatred by Naraku's trap...).

5
[Drawing of Kikyou being cremated, while holding the Shikon no Tama.]
<Kagome:    soshite KIKYOU wa...>
Kagome: .oO(Then Kikyou...).
<Kagome:    INUYASHA no ato o Otte SHinda...>
Kagome: .oO(followed Inuyasha into death...).



Page 16
1
[Darkish frame.]
<Kagome:    soshite FUTARI o HIkiSAita NARAKU ga...>
Kagome: .oO(And Naraku, who split them up...).
<Kagome:    mata KIKYOU o NERAtte iru.>
Kagome: .oO(is going after Kikyou again.).

2
[FlashBack Another flashback to Inuyasha and Kikyou hugging each other
<Inuyasha:    NARAKU kara omae o MAMOreru no wa...>
Inuyasha: I'm the only one...
<Inuyasha:    ore shika inee ja nee ka.>
Inuyasha: who can protect you from Naraku, aren't I.
EndFlashBack]

3
[Kagome is lying on her stomach on the bed, head on the pillow looking sadly
to the side.]
<Kagome:    WATASHI no hairikomu Suki nante...>
Kagome: .oO(For me to come into [Inuyasha's heart]...).
<Kagome:    nai ja nai.>
Kagome: .oO(impossible, isn't it.).

(    Kagome means that Inuyasha's feelings for Kikyou are too strong - so there
is no chance or opening for Inuyasha to be able to love Kagome in return.)



Page 17
1
[Scene change to some birds flying out of a tree. It seems to be evening.]
Fx birds: flap... <Basa...>

2
[Inuyasha is standing on a hillside looking off.]
<Inuyasha:    kagome sumanee...>
Inuyasha: .oO(I'm sorry Kagome...).

3
[Closeup side view of Inuyasha. He still has that quiet look, but looks more serious.]
<Inuyasha:    yappari ore wa...>
Inuyasha: .oO(In the end...).
<Inuyasha:    KIKYOU o hotte okenee.>
Inuyasha: .oO(I can't leave Kikyou alone.).
<Inuyasha:    dakara--->
Inuyasha: .oO(That's why...).



Page 18
1
[White frame.]
<Inuyasha:    kagome--->
Inuyasha: .oO(Kagome...).
<Inuyasha:    mou omae to wa Aenee.>
Inuyasha: .oO(I can't see you again.).
<Inuyasha:    Accha ikenee.>
Inuyasha: .oO(I can't go to see you.).

2
[Scene change to a long view of Kagome lying in her bed.]
<Kagome:    KIKYOU wa INUYASHA no tame ni, INOCHI made NAgeDAshita.>
Kagome: .oO(For Inuyasha's sake, Kikyou even abandoned her life.).
<Kagome:    WATASHI nanka totemo kanawanai.>
Kagome: .oO(I can't compete with that at all.).

3
[Closeup of Kagome, with her eyes closed, gripping the pillow, looking quite sad.]
<Kagome:    mou INUYASHA no tokoro ni wa MODOrenai.>
Kagome: .oO(I can't return to Inuyasha anymore.).

(    I have mentioned before (I think) that Kagome often acts in ways particular
to real Japanese people (and not manga and anime characters) and this
appears to be another example. It is generally considered polite not to get
in between other people's relationships (or to go after someone when
clearly refused), and this is probably part of the reason why Kagome has on
occation asked Inuyasha is he still loves Kikyou - ie it seems that Kagome
was waiting for Inuyasha to get over Kikyou. However, it now appears that
Kagome has realised that she doesn't seem to have any chance anymore. I'm
not sure if she left out of politeness or because she couldn't stand the
pain of her feelings for Inuyasha (or both). Don't worry, I don't think the
series is going to any anytime soon...)
