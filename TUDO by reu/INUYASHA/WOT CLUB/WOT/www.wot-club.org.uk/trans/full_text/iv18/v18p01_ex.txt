Since the first announcement of the anime version of "Inuyasha", there have been
many telephone calls to the editorial department saying things like:

INUYASHA no SEIYUU wa? SHUDAIKA wa? NADONADO, HENSHUUBU ni wa DENWA no TOiAwase ga ippai!!
"when does it start?", "on what channel?", "who's Inuyasha's voice actor?", "what about the theme song?"!!

We're sorry. We're making you all impatient because there's almost nothing we can tell you yet.

** sunbarashii = more extreme version of 'subarashii'?
However, in order to make a magnificent production, the staff meetings and work is intense!!
