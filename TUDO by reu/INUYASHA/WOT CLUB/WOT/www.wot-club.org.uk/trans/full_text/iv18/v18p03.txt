Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

[Overlaid across the whole page is Kagome holding her bag over her shoulder,
making as if about to leave, looking behind over her shoulder.]
<Kagome:    ja, atashi JIKKA ni KAEru kara ne.>
Kagome: Okay, I'm going home now.
<Kagome:    ii no ne INUYASHA.>
Kagome: Allright Inuyasha.

3
[Closeup of Inuyasha turning away, looking annoyed. (He also seems to have
his jacket/coat-top off, but it's not clear.)]
<Inuyasha:    usse- na, sassa to KAEre!>
Inuyasha: Shuddup already, and go home!

4
[Kagome is in the doorway to Kaede's house, just about to leave. Kaede is
patching up Inuyasha with a patient look.]
<Kaede:    omae-ra koko ni MODOtte KUru tabi ni Kenka shite-ru na.>
Kaede: You lot fight every time you come back.
<Kagome:    KAEDE-baa-chan, ato yoroshiku ne.>
Kagome: Kaede-baa-chan, I'll leave the rest to you.

(    Kagome's referring to the treatment of Inuyasha's injuries.)

2
[Kagome is just about to jump into the Well, when Shippou pops up looking worried.]
<Shippou:    OMOitodomare kagome.>

<Shippou:    INUYASHA no Yakimochi wa itsumo no koto dewa nai ka.>
Shippou: Inuyasha's jealousy this time isn't like normal.
<Kagome:    SHIPPOU-chan...>

[FlashBack Back the previous chapter when Kouga was holding Kagome's hands in a 'happy' moment, though Kagome looks rather reluctant.

EndFlashBack]

[Closeup of Shippou.]
<Shippou:    INUYASHA wa UTSUWA ga CHIsai kara, KOUGA no tawaGOTO o MA ni ukete shimau n-ja.
** Can't find 'utsuwa ga chisai' in dictionary but seems reasonably obvious.
>
Shippou: Inuyasha's a low-grade type, so he took really Kouga's nonsense seriously.

5
[Shippou continues on, sighing to himself, while Kagome seems to have a
forces smile.]
<Shippou:    JIBUN ni JISHIN no MOtenai aware na YATSU nan ja.>
Shippou: He's a miserable guy who doesn't have self-confidence.
<Shippou:    soremo kagome ni HOrete ireba koso...>
Shippou: If he's in love with you Kagome, it'd be even worse...
<Kagome:    ...wakatte-ru wa yo.>
Kagome: ...I know that.
