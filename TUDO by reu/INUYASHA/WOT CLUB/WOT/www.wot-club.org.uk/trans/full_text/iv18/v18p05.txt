Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

<Inuyasha:    mashite ya, mou ICHIDO omae no INOCHI o WATAsu nante...
** "inochi o watasu"? (not sure in this context) "die"? "fall into Naraku's hands"? I've done "lost" because that is pretty generic 
>
Inuyasha: To say nothing of [how I'd feel] if I lost you again... 

2

<Kikyou:    mou NIDO to sakki no you na me ni wa awanai.>

[Kikyou looks up at Inuyasha.]
<Kikyou:    soreni NARAKU wa WATASHI o KOROshikirenai.>

<Kikyou:    ONIGUMO no KOKORO ga, WATASHI o SHITAu KOKORO ga NOKOtte iru KAGIri...>
Kikyou: Not while Onigumo's heart, his heart that yearns for me, still remains...

<Kikyou:    NAKAMA no moto ni MODOtta HOU ga ii.>

3
[Inuyasha watches Kikyou leave.]

<Kikyou:    INUYASHA...>
Kikyou: Inuyasha...

5
[Closeup of Inuyasha.]

6
[Closeup side view of Kikyou looking upwards.]
<Kikyou:    ano TOKI SHINIDAMA o NUkarete CHIKARA TSUki nagara,>
Kikyou: At that time when the Dead Souls had been drawn out, and my power was exhausted,
<Kikyou:    hitori de Owatte iku no ka to OMOtta.>
Kikyou: I wondered if, alone, it was over for me.
<Kikyou:    demo omae ga...>
Kikyou: But you...

[Kikyou looks back at Inuyasha, a quiet smile on her face.]
<Kikyou:    INUYASHA, omae ga ite kureta...>

<Inuyasha:    KIKYOU.>
Inuyasha: Kikyou.
Fx Inuyasha: swish <Za_>

3
[Closeup of Inuyasha grabbing Kikyou's hand.]
Fx Inuyasha: *grab* <Gu_>

<Inuyasha:    nanika attara ore o YObu n-da zo.>
Inuyasha: If anything happens, call for me.
<Kikyou:    INUYASHA...>
Kikyou: Inuyasha...



Page 9
1
[Closeup of Inuyasha and Kikyou hugging each other close. Kikyou has her
eyes closed and looks particularly at peace, while Inuyasha is looking at
her seriously.]
<Kikyou:    DAIJOUBU da, INUYASHA...>
Kikyou: It'll be okay, Inuyasha...
<Kikyou:    omae IGAI no OTOKO ni wa, KAMI no KE HITOSUJI mo FUresase wa shinai.>
Kikyou: I won't let any man other than you even touch a hair on my head.

2
[Scene change, sort of. Inuyasha and Kikyou can still be seen hugging each
other, but they are shown in the middle of what appears to be a mirror held
by Kanna.]
Fx image: *radiate...* <Bou...>

3
[Wider angle view - Naraku is calmly looking at the mirror in Kanna's hands.]
<Naraku:    ...mou ii KANNA,>
Naraku: ...Enough Kanna,
<Naraku:    sagare.>
Naraku: leave.



Page 10
1
[Naraku is standing by himself in the darkened room, holding a sword in his
right hand, and has his clothes off at the shoulder.]
<Naraku:    SHITTO...?>
Naraku: .oO(Jealousy...?).

2
[Closeup side view of Naraku, with a cold look - he looks kinda disgusted.]
<Naraku:    koremo... ONIGUMO no,>
Naraku: .oO(This is also... Onigumo's,).
<Naraku:    USUGITANAi NINGEN no KOKORO...>
Naraku: .oO(that filthy human's heart...?).

3
[Closeup of Naraku's hand on the sword.]
<Naraku:    kudaran.>
Naraku: .oO(Useless.).
Fx Naraku: (sword hilt) *grip* <Gu_>

(    It's a bit hard to get exactly the feeling of what Naraku says across -
sort of a combination of "useless","meaningless","pathetic", "worthless"
etc. Basically, he hates having Onigumo's left-over feelings and that those
feelings themselves are also dirt.)

4
[Closeup of Naraku's back, showing the spider mark, covering most of his
back. Naraku has stabbed himself with the sword - pushing the blade just
under the surface of the skin from the top right of the spider mark, and
the tip of the sword comes out near the bottom left of the spider mark.]
Fx Naraku: shh <Za_>

5
[A guard comes towards the room, hearing some odd sounds.]
Fx sound: {off} *rip rip rip* <Bari Bari Bari>
<guard:    TONO...?>
guard: Tono...?

6
[Closeup of the guard.]
<guard:    e"!?>
guard: _Eh_!?



Page 11
1
[View of Naraku's back (from the guard's point of view presumably) with
Naraku turning around to glare. Naraku has cut all the skin off his back.]

2
[Closeup of Naraku's left (?) hand, holding a large patch of blood-stained
skin, with the mark of a spider on it.]
Fx skin: *dangle...* <Bura...>

3
[The guard is quite shocked.]
<guard:    se.. SENAKA no KAWA...!?>
guard: .oO(Th... the skin from his back...!?).
<guard:    hi...>
guard: Yeek...

4
[Naraku calmly slashes the guard with the sword.]
Fx Narak: (guard) *slice* <Zan>



Page 12

[Kagura is standing in the doorway, holding up her fan.]
Fx fan: *hold up* <Su_>
Fx guard's body: *fall with a thud* <Dosha>
Kagura: ......

2
[Closeup of Kagura with a curious expression.]
<Kagura:    dou shita no sa NARAKU.>
Kagura: What's happened to you Naraku.
<Kagura:    goRANSHIN ka yo.>
Kagura: Have you gone insane huh?

3
[Closeup view of the back of Naraku's head.]
<Naraku:    urusai.>

[Scene change to a view of the sky.]

[Miroku (with his right arm in a sling) and Kaede are standing in front of
the hut, looking out into the night sky.]
<Miroku:    KAEDE-sama are wa...>

Kaede: ......

[View of some glowing lights above the forest.]
Fx lights: *glow...* <Pou...>
<Kaede:    SHINIDAMA...>
Kaede: .oO(The Dead Souls...).

7
[Closeup of Kaede.]
<Kaede:    KIKYOU-onee-sama...>
Kaede: .oO(Kikyou-onee-sama...).
<Kaede:    CHIKAku ni iru no ka.>
Kaede: .oO(Are you nearby?).



Page 13
1
[Scene change to a view of Inuyasha standing by the tree, thinking. There's
a closeup of Inuyasha overlaid.]
<Inuyasha:    KIKYOU...>
Inuyasha: .oO(Kikyou...).

2
[View of Kagome from Inuyasha's point of view - she is clearly standing out
to be noticed, but she doesn't have much of an expression.]

3
[Closeup of Inuyasha noticing Kagome, surprised.]
Inuyasha: !
<Inuyasha:    kagome...>
Inuyasha: .oO(Kagome...).

4
[Closeup of Kagome - she seems to have a pitying expression.]

Kagome: .oO({off} Why!?).



Page 15
1
[Long view of the pair staring into each other's eyes.]
<Kagome:    doushite ME o sorasanai de irareru no!?
** I think I got this right but not 100% certain about the "nai de irareru" bit
>
Kagome: .oO(Why doesn't he look away from me!?).

2
[Scene change to the night sky again.]
Fx sound: rustle... <Zawa...>

3
[View of a cave by a lake.]
Fx water: slish.... <Zaa...>

4
[Kikyou is inside the cave looking at a bare patch of ground.]
<Kikyou:    WATASHI ga TEOi no YATOU ONIGUMO o kakumai... TEAte shite ita HORAANA...>
Kikyou: .oO(This is the cave where I sheltered, and treated... the wounded wild-thief Onigumo...).



Page 16
1
[Closeup of Kikyou putting a hand to the patch of ground where nothing grows.]
<Kikyou:    sou da ONIGUMO,>
Kikyou: .oO(That's right Onigumo,).
<Kikyou:    kisama wa kono BASHO ni YOKOtawatte ita...>
Kikyou: .oO(you lied down at this place...).

2
[Scene change to a view of a Japanese castle - it seems to be morning.]
Fx leaves: rustle... <Zaa...>

3
[Misty frame.]
<Naraku:    KAWA o haidemo, HI de YAitemo...>
Naraku: .oO(Even if I peel off the skin, or burn it with fire...).
<Naraku:    SENAKA no KUMO wa mata Ukabi agatte kuru.>

4
[view of the spider.]
<Naraku:    KEsshite KIenu.>

5
[View of Naraku sitting in the castle. There is a lit lamp next to him.]
<Naraku:    ONIGUMO no KOKORO no you ni...>
Naraku: .oO(Like Onigumo's heart...).



Page 17
1
[Naraku looks to the side in annoyance as the smoke from the lamp drifts to
the side, from a waft of air presumably of someone entering the room.]
Fx smoke: *snuff out...* <Fu...>
Naraku: !

2
[View of Kikyou walking in carrying her bow. She has a slight grim smile.]
Fx Kikyou: rustle... <Zawa...>

3
[Closeup of Naraku recognising her - the last person he wanted to see.]
<Naraku:    KIKYOU...>
Naraku: Kikyou...



Page 18
1
[Kikyou and Naraku face off across the room.]
<Kikyou:    dou shita NARAKU.>
Kikyou: What's up Naraku.
<Kikyou:    motto UREshisou na KAO o shitara dou da.>
Kikyou: What don't you try to look happier.

2
[Closeup of Kikyou with a thin smile.]
<Kikyou:    kono WATASHI ga, wazawaza kisama o TAZUnete kite yatta no dakara na.>
Kikyou: After all, it is me, and I've come all this way to visit you.

(    Kikyou here directly calls Naraku "kisama" ("you", very rudely) which she
hasn't done before. When someone changes the style in which they talk to
someone else compared to similar situations in the past, this usually
indicates a change in the "relationship". The change in the relationship
(in a general sense) would depend on the change in the style of language
used. Being ruder than before, can be a bit like a open declaration of war,
in some cases, though I don't know if that is the case here.)
