Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

raises a paw.]

<Miroku:    WATASHI to SANGO wa ASU ICHIBAN ni SHIRO ATO o SHIRAbe ni TAtsu.>
Miroku: Sango and I are setting off first thing tomorrow to investigate the castle remains.
<Sango:    INUYASHA, anta dou suru?>

2
[Inuyasha responds matter of factly.]
<Inuyasha:    dou tte, Iku ni KImatte n-daro!>

3
[Closeup of Sango.]
<Sango:    kagome-chan hottarakashi de?>

Inuyasha: wha...
<Inuyasha:    kagome no koto wa...>
Inuyasha: Kagome is...
<Miroku:    SAKI nobashi ni shite dou suru.>
Miroku: What will prolonging this further do?

5
[Miroku continues explaining, looking a bit fed up and Sango is looking away
from Inuyasha, who is rather annoyed.]
<Miroku:    KOKORO ga KImatte iru no nara, Ai ni Ikeba yokarou.>
Miroku: If you're certain of your feelings, then you should go see her.
<Sango:    ho-nto, itsumademo Guzuguzu shite sa-.>

[Closeup of Inuyasha shouting angrily.]
<Inuyasha:    sonna ni ore to kagome o WAKAresasete- no ka!>

2
[Miroku responds calmly, and Inuyasha looks surprised.]
<Miroku:    WAKAretakunai no ka.>
Miroku: So you don't want to break up, huh.

Inuyasha: There's [no way] I can ask Kagome "please come back"...

Page 8
1
[Inuyasha suddenly notices that nobody else is around him.]
<Inuyasha:    tte, DAREmo inee.>
Inuyasha: hey, nobody's here.

(    I guess Miroku and the others have deliberately left him, as he seems less
hesitant and self-conscious when by himself. (remember about 20-30 chapters
ago when Kagome last went back, and Miroku told Sango not to watch him...))

5
[White frame.]
<Inuyasha:    ore mo Owarenee.>
Inuyasha: .oO(it won't be over for me either.).

school uniform (where's her bag?) and she seems to be waiting patiently as

<Inuyasha:    ore wa omae ni Au made,>
Inuyasha: until I met you,
<Inuyasha:    DAREmo SHINjirarenakatta.>

[Closeup side view of Kagome.]
<Kagome:    nanka ne, KIKYOU mo WATASHI to ONAji KIMOchi datta n-ja nai ka tte OMOttara,>
Kagome: Somehow, when I thought "aren't both Kikyou and my feelings the same?",
