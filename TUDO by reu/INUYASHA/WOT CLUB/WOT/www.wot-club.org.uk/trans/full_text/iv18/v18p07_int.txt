<Tomioka:    INUYASHA no IROMIHON ga, tsui ni DEKI mashita yo!>
Tomioka: The colour samples from "Inuyasha" are finally done!
<Tomioka:    dou desu ka, TAKAHASHI SENSEI!!>
Tomioka: What do think, Takahashi-sensei!!

<Takahashi:    Kirei desu nee.>
Takahashi: They're nice, aren't they.
<Takahashi:    demo JISSAI ni TV de MIru to donna IRO ni naru ka WAkaranai n-de.>
Takahashi: But, I don't know how the colours will actually look when seen on TV.
<Takahashi:    tonikaku kakko yoku!!>
Takahashi: Anyway, they're great!!

<Tomioka:    hai, WAkari mashita.>
Tomioka: Yes, I understand.
<Tomioka:    iyaa, sore ni shitemo RENSAI TOUSHO kara YOnde masu ga, masaka JIBUN ga Anime-KA suru nante OMOi masen deshita yo!!>
Tomioka: Well on top of that, I read the original serial seial, but I never thought I'd be doing the anime version!!

<Takahashi:    WATASHI no RENSAI SAKUHIN no NAKA dewa oWARAi ga SUKUnai HOU desu kara, WATASHI JIBUN mo Anime no "INUYASHA", dou naru n-darou tte! (WARAI)>
Takahashi: As far as my serial work is concerned, there are few laughs, so I myself worried about the Inuyasha anime! (laughs)
<Takahashi:    demo Anime ni naru nara, Shiriasu bakkari ja naku, AKAruku TANOshii BUBUN mo MIte mitai naa to.>
Takahashi: So for when it becomes an anime, instead of making it serious all the time, I thought I should also have cheerful and fun parts as well.

<Tomioka:    sorya mou!>
Tomioka: Indeed!
<Tomioka:    KANTOKU no IKEDA-san to, NANI yori GENSAKU o TAISETSU ni EGAku koto o ICHIBAN ni yarou tte CHIKAtta n-desu yo.
** erg "ichiban ni yarou tte chikatta"? "first to swear"? "swears more than anybody else"? ('ichiban' is normally 'number 1', but this sounds strange in english in this context)
>
Tomioka: Ikeda-san the director, first swore to treasure the drawing of the original work above all else.
<Tomioka:    dakara, GENSAKU no AKArui BUBUN, JUUBUN ni Ikashite iki masu!!>
Tomioka: Therefor, we'll make use of the cheerful parts in the original work!!

<Takahashi:    demo UGOki ya OTO to ka, Anime ja nai to DEKInai HYOUGEN ga TANOshimi dattari suru n-de, anmari GENSAKU ni SHIBArarezu ni IROIRO yatte kudasai.>
Takahashi: But I'll be looking forward to movement and sound which can't be done without anime, and please don't feel bound to the original work and try other things.

<Tomioka:    mou, MItaME Hade ni kakko yoku MIseru no wa, TOKUI desu kara (WARAI).
** not sure if I've done 'mitame', 'hade', or 'tokui' right.
>
Tomioka: Before long, we'll show the flashy and cool appearance we take pride in (laughs).
<Tomioka:    ato TAKAHASHI SENSEI no Gyagu Teisuto no DAshi KATA mo, KANTOKU ni SAKU ga aru sou desu!
** not sure how to do 'ato' here. Also, is 'saku ga aru' 'plans to do' or 'has a plan' I this case?
>
Tomioka: The director also has a plan to keep to Takahashi-sensei's taste in doing gags.
<Tomioka:    a_, tokoro de RAISHUU wa iyoiyo SEIYUU-san no O-dishyon desu ga...!!>
Tomioka: Ah, by the way, next week finally is the audition for the seiyuu-san...!!

<Takahashi:    u~n.>
Takahashi: Hmm.
<Takahashi:    INUYASHA no KOE wa, yappari SHOUNEN no KOE desu ne.>
Takahashi: Inuyasha's voice is after all a young boy's voice.
<Takahashi:    DANSEI no SEIYUU-san de, zehi oNEGAi shitai desu!>
Takahashi: I definately would like a male seiyuu-san for him!
<Takahashi:    JOSEI da to KODOMOppoku nari sugide, IWAKAN ga... motto KODOMO dattara ii n-desu kedo.>
Takahashi: A female would sound too child-like, and out of place, but... that's fine if [the character] is more like a child though.

(    Female seiyuu fairly often get parts of (young) male characters.)

<Tomioka:    TATOeba, SHIPPOU to ka?>
Tomioka: Like Shippou, for example?

<Takahashi:    sou sou!>
Takahashi: Exactly!
<Takahashi:    SHIPPOU wa TOKUni JOSEI ja nai to DEKInai desu yo ne.>
Takahashi: Shippou in particular wouldn't work without a female [seiyuu].
<Takahashi:    masaka, HONTOU no KODOMO o TSUrete kite, yatte moraeru n-desu ka?>
Takahashi: I don't suppose you could actually bring in a real child could you?

<Tomioka:    iya... hora KOE KAwari shitara TAIHEN deshou (WARAI).>
Tomioka: Not really... like, if their voice changed, it would be a major problem wouldn't it (laughs).
<Tomioka:    ja TSUGI ni, kagome no HOU wa?>
Tomioka: Next then, what about Kagome?

<Takahashi:    u~n, chotto Ime-ji shi zurakutte MUZUKAshii n-desu ga... maa, anmari AMAsuginai KOE de, naokatsu dokoka SAWAyaka na KANji ga aru to ii ka natte.>
Takahashi: Hmm, it's a bit hard to image her voice, but... I feel that something like, well, a voice which isn't too sweet, and yet refreshing would be good.

<Tomioka:    TASHIkani MUZUKAshii kamo.>
Tomioka: It certainly could be hard.
<Tomioka:    demo suru to KIKYOU no HOU wa...?>
Tomioka: Then how about Kikyou...?

<Takahashi:    manga no NAKA dewa, kagome to NIteru tte Itte masu ga, SEIKAKU ga CHIGAu kara KAO mo CHIGAu n-desu, JITSU wa!>
Takahashi: In the manga, it's said Kagome looks like her, but her personality is different and her face is also different - it's true!
<Takahashi:    TOUZEN, KOE mo kagome to CHIGAu kara, anmari kawaiSUGIte mo Dame.>
Takahashi: So of course, her voice would be different to Kagome's, and being too sweet would also be no good.
<Takahashi:    tada, dokoka Sofuto na KANji wa HOshii desu ne.>
Takahashi: But, I want a soft feeling somewhere.
<Takahashi:    NANI o Ittemo YURUsareru mitai na (WARAI).>
Takahashi: Seems like you'll be forgiven no matter what I say (laughs).

<Tomioka:    tada no NIKUmare YAKU ja nai desu kara ne.
** eh? 'nikumare yaku' = 'thankless role'? (sorry, that doesn't make much sense to me)
>
Tomioka: It's not just a thankless role is it.
<Tomioka:    TASHIka KIKYOU wa kagome yori TOSHIUE desu yo ne.>
Tomioka: Kikyou is certainly older than Kagome isn't she.

<Takahashi:    ee.>
Takahashi: Right.
<Takahashi:    kagome ga 15 SAI de... KAite ite FUTARI no KAO ga CHIGAu no wa, kitto KIKYOU ga TOSHIUE dakara darou to (WARAI).>
Takahashi: Kagome is 15 years old... and drawing their two faces is different, and surely Kikyou would be older (laughs).
<Takahashi:    KIKYOU wa 17 SAI kurai ka na.>
Takahashi: I guess Kikyou is around 17 years old.

<Tomioka:    naruhodo (WARAI).>
Tomioka: I see (laughs).
<Tomioka:    dewa O-dishon CD ga DEKItara, mata oMOchi shimasu.>
Tomioka: Okay, when the audition CD is done, I'll come around again.

(    I guess he means doing a recording of the audition on a CD...)

<Takahashi:    Hai, MAtte masu!!>
Takahashi: Okay, I'll be waiting!!
<Takahashi:    de, INUYASHA ga UGOite SHABEru no ga MIrareru no wa itsu KORO ni?>
Takahashi: So, about when will I be able to see Inuyasha moving and talking?

<Tomioka:    sore wa mada chotto SAKI ni naru n-desu ga... (WARAI).>
Tomioka: That's still rather unknown though... (laughs).

<Takahashi:    KOE ya Dorama mo DAIJI dakedo, Akushon mo TANOshimi na BUBUN desu yo ne.>
Takahashi: The voices and drama are both important, but I'm looking forward to the action parts too.
<Takahashi:    demo, AIMA ni HASAmaru Episo-do to no KANKYUU no tsukeKATA ga Pointo ni naru to OMOi masu kedo.
** "aima ni hasamaru episode" = "during the episode"? "between different episodes"?
>
Takahashi: But, I think the way in which the action stops and starts during an episode is an important point too. (or something like that - not sure about translating this line...)
<Takahashi:    UGOku tokoro wa UGOite, NUku tokoro wa NUite mitai na.
** not sure what 'nuku' is supposed to mean here.
>
Takahashi: When there's action there's action, and when there's a pause there should be a pause, shouldn't there. (trouble translating this line too...)
<Takahashi:    yappari TAISETSU na BAMEN wa, jikkuri AJIwaitai desu kara ne.>
Takahashi: Certainly when there's an important scene, you want to carefully relish it, right.

<Tomioka:    sore mo chanto.>
Tomioka: We'll do that properly too.
<Tomioka:    "INUYASHA" wa, dou TSUKUttemo Hitto MACHIGAi nashi no SAKUHIN desu kedo, sore ni AMAezu KANTOKU o HAJIme sutaffu ICHIDOU, HONTOU ni ISSHOUKENMEI ganbatte masu.
** is this "Inuyasha will be a hit no matter what" or "Inuyasha won't be a hit no matter what" (ie, isn't guaranteed to be a hit)
>
Tomioka: "Inuyasha" will be a hit no matter how we make it, but the director isn't relying on that and all the staff have really given their utmost since the beginning.
<Tomioka:    KITAIshite kudasai!!
** is he addressing the staff here?
>
Tomioka: I hope we live up to expectations!!

<Takahashi:    TAIHEN dato wa OMOi masu ga, yoroshiku oNEGAi shimasu.>
Takahashi: It sounds like a lot of work, but I wish you the best.

<Tomioka:    JITSU wa, kore dake YUUMEI na GENSAKUMONO no SAKUHIN o yaru no wa HAJImete de.>
Tomioka: Actually, this is the first time I've done such a famous author's work.
<Tomioka:    UREshii shi, KOUEI da shi, yarigai mo ari masu.>
Tomioka: I'm happy, and honoured, and it'll be a challenge too.
<Tomioka:    demo, sono BUN SEKININ mo OMOi desu kedo ne (WARAI).>
Tomioka: But on the other hand, the responsibility is also heavy, isn't it (laughs).
<Tomioka:    de, KYOU, DAI 2 WA no E Konte ga DEKIte kita n-de, Chekku o...!>
Tomioka: Oh, today, the continuity for episode 2 was completed, [I need to] check it...!

<Takahashi:    Hai.>
Takahashi: Sure.
<Takahashi:    oTAGAi, SEKININ JUUDAI desu yo ne... (WARAI).>
Takahashi: We both have heavy responsibilities don't we... (laughs).
