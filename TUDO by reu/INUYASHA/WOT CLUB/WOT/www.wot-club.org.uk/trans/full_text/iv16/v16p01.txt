Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

[Cut scene to a view of the outside of the largeish building in which Kagome
and the rest are.]
Fx sound: rumble... <Goooo...>

2
[Wide view of a room - Kagome is lying face-down on the floor but still
holding her bow, and beside her is Sango (looking unconscious face-down on
the floor) with her boomerang beside her. Along the length of Kagome's body
is a mist-like glow (her soul), being pulled towards and into Kanna's
mirror, who is standing a short distance from Kagome.]
Fx soul: swish... <Za---...>

3
[Closeup of Kanna.]
Fx soul: hshht... <Shu---...>

4
[Closeup of Kagome - her eyes are open but glazed over, as her soul
continues to pour from her.]



Page 7
1
[Closeup of Kanna, with light around her mirror, but it seems the stream of
Kagome's soul has ended.]
<Kanna:    TAMASHII ga...>
Kanna: The soul...
<Kanna:    OSAmari kiranai...>
Kanna: is overflowing [the mirror]...

2
[Closeup side view of Kanna.]
<Kanna:    demo...>

[Closeup of Kanna extending an arm to reach for something.]
<Kanna:    kagome no MOtte-ru SHIKON no kakera...>
Kanna: The Shikon fragment which Kagome has...
<Kanna:    choudai.>
Kanna: is mine.
Fx Kanna: *reach out...* <Su...>

5
[Closeup of Kagome who now looks conscious but is sweating, gritting her
teeth and looks strained.]
Fx Kagome: *twitch* <Piku_>



Page 8
1
[Kagome suddenly sits up and now has an arrow in her bow, pointing it at Kanna.]
Fx Kagome: fwip <Ba_>

(    It's not completely clear, but I don't think Kagome was lying in wait for
Kanna, but more like she was mostly/completely unable to move/react only
while her soul was being sucked out. Perhaps she recovered a bit in the
short time between when Kanna stopped sucking out her soul, and went for
the Shikon fragment. Likewise it's not completely clear why Kanna couldn't
suck out Kagome's soul completely, but earlier chapters have clearly shown
that Kagome's soul is far bigger than normal, and that she is much more
resistant to spiritual/soul attacks/spells than normal, but not invulnerable.)

2
[Closeup of Kanna looking quite shocked, for her - she's just a bit
wide-eyed and her lips are open in surprise.]
<Kanna:    mada UGOite-ru...>
Kanna: .oO(She's still moving...).

3
[Closeup of Kagome with the arrow drawn - it looks like Kagome is really
having to force herself to keep moving. She is sweating, gritting her teeth
and generally looks strained, but she is holding herself steady.]
Fx bow: *tense...* <Kiri...>

where a leg of Kirara is seen stepping forwards.]

<Shippou:    ko_, kora_, soko no SHIROi no_.>

<Shippou:    UGOku to KAmi KOROsu zo__.>
Shippou: Move and you'll be bitten to death [by Kirara]!!
