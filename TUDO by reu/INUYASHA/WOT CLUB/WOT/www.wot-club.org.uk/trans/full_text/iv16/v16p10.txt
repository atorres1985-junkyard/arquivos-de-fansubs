Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

[Toutousai has pulled out Inuyasha's top left fang with the pliers and is
looking at the tooth critically. Inuyasha's body is in his normal casual
arms-folded pose, but he has a shocked look on his face, and his head is
shaking slightly.]

<Toutousai:    ma, kono KIBA de i- ka.>

<Rin:    yada_,>
Rin: No!
<Rin:    rin mo ISSHO ni Iku_.>
Rin: Rin's going with you!

(    Some young girls will use their name instead of "I". (extra cute effect)) 

4
[Wider view - in a desolate patch of ground, surrounded by mist, Rin is
standing looking off at Sesshoumaru, who is walking off with Goshinki's
head. Jaken is yelling at Rin, next to her. Near Sesshoumaru is that squat
two-headed dragon-like creature Sesshoumaru turned up on several volumes ago.]
<Jaken:    wakaran Gaki da na_.>
Jaken: You slow-minded brat!
<Jaken:    koko kara SAKI, NINGEN nanzo ga HAIttara, DOKKE de SHInde shimau n-da zo.>

dragon-like thing.]

[View of a shack beside the water's edge.]
Fx mist: rustle... <Zawa...>

[Closeup of a rather coarse looking middle-ages Youkai lounging on the floor
inside the shack. He is rather simply dressed, though he has a ring of
small (human?) skulls around his neck. He's rather thin looking, though
squat, and has the usual pointed Youkai ears, and two little bumps on his brow.]
<Kaijinbou:    n~?>
Kaijinbou: Hn~n?
<Kaijinbou:    DARE da temee-ra.>
Kaijinbou: Who're you bastards.



Page 6

[Sesshoumaru is standing inside by the doorway with Goshinki's head over his
shoulder and Jaken by his side.]
<Sesshoumaru:    kisama ga KAIJINBOU ka.>
Sesshoumaru: So you're Kaijinbou huh.

(    "Kaijinbou" = "ash-blade-boy". Maybe "monk" or "priest", instead of "boy".)

2
[Closeup of Kaijinbou, who gets something Sesshoumaru says,.]
<Sesshoumaru:    amari ni YOKOSHIMA na KATANA bakari Utsu tame ni,>
Sesshoumaru: {off} Because you forged too many swords that were just evil, 
<Sesshoumaru:    KATANA KAJI no SHI TOUTOUSAI kara HAMONsareta sou da na.>
Sesshoumaru: you were expelled by your swordsmith teacher, Toutousai, right.

3
[View of Kaijinbou.]
<Kaijinbou:    TOUTOUSAI... ka.>
Kaijinbou: Toutousai... huh.
<Kaijinbou:    HISAshiburi ni KIitemo, MUNAkusoWARUi NAMAE da.>

<Kaijinbou:    n~?>
Kaijinbou: Hn~n?

3
[Closeup of Kaijinbou looking annoyed.]
<Kaijinbou:    ke_, fuzaken na.>
Kaijinbou: Bah, don't play around.
<Kaijinbou:    konna SHInda KIBA ja, roku na KATANA Utenee yo.
"shinda kiba" is emphasized with dots
>
Kaijinbou: A worthy sword can't be made with such _dead fangs_.

[Closeup side view of Sesshoumaru.]

Kagome: Tetsusaiga should be repaired by tomorrow, but...
<Shippou:    mazui TOKI ni hikkakatta nou.>
Shippou: the timing rather stinks.

3
[Inuyasha is sitting on the ground, seeming a bit upset. Possibly because
he's mostly human again - looks like it's the night of the new moon.]
<Inuyasha:    _taku chikusho- me.>
Inuyasha: Damn it to hell.
<Inuyasha:    OSE- na, TOUTOUSAI no jijii wa yo-.>

2
[Inuyasha is looking at Miroku in annoyed across the camp-fire.]
<Miroku:    konna TOKI ni TEKI ni OSOwaretara, INOCHI ni KAKAwaru.>
Miroku: If he'd attacked by an enemy at this time, his life will be in danger.
<Miroku:    dakara, SAKU no HI ni INUYASHA ga YOURYOKU o USHINAu koto wa, ZETTAI ni HIMITSU...>
Miroku: Therefor, that Inuyasha loses his Youkai-powers on the first day of the month, is a critical secret...
