Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

animated and basically full of life) Unlike before, she is now clean, and

<Sesshoumaru:    kono SESSHOUMARU ya CHICHI-UE to ONAji...>
Sesshoumaru: .oO(It's the same as mine and chichi-ue's...).

(    'chichi-ue' is an old, and respectful, way of saying "father". Myouga says
'chichi-gimi' to refer to Sesshoumaru's father, which is and even older
style. (I think))

4
[Patchy frame.]

5

2
[Closeup of Myouga, looking a bit worried.]

<Kagome:    TETSUSAIGA ga Oreta koto to KANKEI aru no?>

<Myouga:    TETSUSAIGA ga Oreru to iu koto wa,>
Myouga: If Tetsusaiga is broken [in a fight],
<Myouga:    SHInu to iu koto.>
Myouga: it means he will be killed [by his attacker].
<Myouga:    sore demo Ikiyou to suru HONNOU ga...>
Myouga: That is unless his instinct to live...

2
[Drawing of Inuyasha charging forwards, in his "transformed" state.]
<Myouga:    INUYASHA-sama no YOUKAI no CHI o, YObisamashite shimouta n-ja.>
Myouga: awakens Inuyasha-sama's Youkai blood.

3
[Kagome and Myouga look at each other.]
<Myouga:    soshite ICHIDO MEZAmete shimatta YOUKAI no CHI wa,>
Myouga: And once his Youkai blood is awake,



Page 20
1
[Closeup of Myouga making a point.]
<Myouga:    tatoe TETSUSAIGA o Uchinaoshita tokoro de, IMA made no you ni wa OSAe kirenu hazu.>
Myouga: it shouldn't be possible for it to settle back down to what it was before, even if Tetsusaiga is completely repaired.
<Myouga:    nanishiro, TEKI o HIkiSAKU YOROKObi o, SHItte shimawareta no dakara na.>
