Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

back, with Shippou bouncing at his side, and Kirara carrying Sango and Koharu.]
Fx Miroku: swish <Za_>
<Shippou:    KAGAMI no YOUKAI MUSUME mo, NARAKU no NAKAMA nan jaro ka.>
Shippou: I guess the girl Youkai with the mirror, is also a friend of Naraku.
<Miroku:    deshou na.>

[Closeup side view of Miroku looking worried.]

5
[Closeup of Kagura looking at something.]
<Kagura:    chi_, SHIKATAnee.>
Kagura: .oO(Drat, well, never mind that then.).

(    What this means is that Kagura was following a plan (probably by Naraku)
which had some more involved way to finish off Inuyasha, but Kagura was
starting to think that she wouldn't need that, but with the villagers
moving to the side, it means the original plan will go ahead.)
