Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

Miroku: With those wounds, he shouldn't be moving around for a bit.
<Kagome:    un...>
Kagome: Umm...

(    'Hai' is rather like 'yes' (though more flexible). 'Un' is a common
colloquialism for 'hai', though not a general replacement. I guess I got
fed up with translating 'un' as 'yeah', so I did 'Umm', above.)
