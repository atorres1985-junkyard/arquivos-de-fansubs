Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

[In a flash of movement, the villagers' bodies get ripped apart.]
Fx villagers: crunch <Baki>

2
[A clearer view of the new monster - it looks a bit like the massive demons
Sesshoumaru has turned up with twice, except only being a few meters high.
His (?) body is black and a bit thin (except for the torso) and has two
horns on his head, as well a wide mouth of sharp teeth. Kagura is casually
watching it nearby, while it eats up the villagers.]
Fx youkai: (flesh) munch munch <Bari Bari>
Kagura: ......

[Closeup of Kagura.]
<Kagura:    _taku, nanda kono BAkeMONO wa.>

youkai: You were just thinking that I'm just a big-eating no-talent thing, right.
<youkai:    ANE-UE...>
youkai: Ane-ue...
Kagura: !

(    "Ane-ue" is a rather respectful (and old) form of "elder sister". This is
presumably the third Youkai Naraku has made.)

<Kagura:    koitsu...>
Kagura: .oO(He...).

[Inside the hut, Kagome is sitting next to Sango, who is sitting up weakly,
while Miroku looks on.]

<Sango:    DAIJOUBU...>
Sango: I'm okay...
<Sango:    mou... koko mo ABUnai n-daro.>
Sango: It's... now dangerous being here too, right.
<Miroku:    KAGURA ga CHIKAku ni Ita sou desu kara na.>

[In the foreground, Miroku is looking bored/annoyed while applying some
bandages to Inuyasha, who is just staring out into space. In the
background, Kagome has her back to Miroku and Inuyasha, while Sango looks
over at the guys.]

<Kagome:    mou ARUitemo HEIKI mitai da shi.>
Kagome: It seems he can walk about fine now.

6
[Miroku is looking a bit stern while talking to Inuyasha, who looks a bit annoyed/put-on.]
<Miroku:    kagome-sama ni ayamare, INUYASHA.>
Miroku: Apologise to Kagome-sama, Inuyasha.
<Miroku:    WATASHI ga ii MEIWAKU da.>
Miroku: It's an annoyance for me.

7
[Miroku seems to be talking to himself, but Inuyasha gets a sweat-drop and
Sango looks a bit annoyed.]
<Miroku:    SANGO no wakiBARA o sasutte yatte iru HOU ga, dore dake TANOshii ka...>
Miroku: I wonder how enjoyable it would be to massage Sango's side instead...
Fx Miroku: *si~i~i~i~gh* <ha~~~~>
<Sango:    sasurande ii.>
Sango: Don't need a massage.

(    Miroku hopes for Kagome and Inuyasha to make up, in which case Kagome would
take care of Inuyasha, leaving Sango to him...)

[Inuyasha suddenly notices something.]
Fx Inuyasha: *twitch* <Piku>

<Inuyasha:    SENAKA ni KUMO!?>
Inuyasha: .oO(A spider on his back!?).
<Miroku:    NARAKU no BUNSHIN ka!?>
Miroku: .oO(An offspring of Naraku!?).

4
[Kagome and Sango look on in shock as the man falls over, in two - his torso
is seperate to the rest of his body.]
Fx body: *fall with a thud* <Dosha>
<Kagome:    kya_.>
Kagome: Kya!

5
[The blood around the body bubbles, just like the dead wolf-man messenger
manipulated by Kagura, in the recent story with Kouga.]

[Kagome, Sango and Miroku look on.]
<Kagome:    kono HITO... SAISHO kara SHInde-ta...?>

<Kagome:    anta mada Kega ga NAOttenai ja nai.>

[Inuyasha responds angrily.]
<Inuyasha:    ke_.>
Inuyasha: Bah!
<Inuyasha:    Iku shika nee daro.>
Inuyasha: There's no choice but to go.

4
[Sango explains to Kagome, while Miroku looks off.]
<Sango:    aa... SHITAI o TSUKAi ni yokoshita tte koto wa,>
Sango: Yeah... she used that corpse to tell us,
<Sango:    atashi-tachi no IBASHO ga wakatte-ru tte koto da yo.>
Sango: that she knows where we are staying.
Kagome: ......
<Miroku:    NIgetemo MUDA to iu koto desu.>
Miroku: Even if we run, it won't help.

5
[Closeup of Inuyasha speaking forcefully.]
<Inuyasha:    wakattara Iku ze.>
Inuyasha: Now that you understand, let's go!
<Inuyasha:    OSOkare HAYAkare OtTE ga KUru koto wa, wakatte-ta n-da!>

[The scene has now moved back to where the third Youkai is at the village,
eating some animal. The bones of some villagers with the flesh eaten off
are lying on the ground. The spider mark on the back of the new Youkai is
quite prominent.]

inside it.]

<youkai:    sonna mon tokku ni ore ga KUcchimatta yo...>
youkai: I've already eaten that lot...

(    "otou" and "okaa" are regional variants for "otou-san" (father) and
"okaa-san" (mother).)

3
[The Youkai dives at the terrified kids.]
<youkai:    uso ja nee sa.>
youkai: You'll see I'm not lying.
<youkai:    ore no HARA no NAKA MItemi na.>
youkai: As you'll be seeing them inside my stomach!
