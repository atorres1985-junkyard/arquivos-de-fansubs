Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

carrying a bag, instead of her normal school clothes - probably set in
modern times.]

taken a bath. Buyo, the cat, is lying on top of her.]

[Closeup side view of Kagome thinking, looking a bit sad.]
<Kagome:    INUYASHA ni wa DAMAtte KAEtte KIchiatta kedo...>
Kagome: .oO(I came back without telling Inuyasha, but...).
<Kagome:    ii yo ne.>
Kagome: .oO(I guess it's okay.).

[Drawing of Kikyou, last Kagome (and the others) saw of her.]
<Kagome:    KIKYOU...>
Kagome: .oO(Kikyou...).
<Kagome:    REIRYOKU mo MODOtte GENKIsou ni mieta kedo...>
Kagome: .oO(It looks like both her spiritual powers have returned and that she's in good shape, but..).

[View of Kagome.]
<Kagome:    sono mamma mata inakunacchatta shi...>
Kagome: she vanished again after that...
<Kagome:    HONTOU wa INUYASHA, Okkaetakatta no kamo...>
Kagome: Maybe Inuyasha really wanted to go after her...

2
[Closeup of Kagome.]
<Kagome:    KAEDE-baa-chan no MURA ni TSUku made,>
Kagome: and until we reached Kaede-baa-chan's village,
<Kagome:    nanka HANAshi-zurakatta shi...>
Kagome: it was hard talking to him...

3
[View of Kagome looking slightly sad.]
Kagome: ......

4
[Kagome turns to look to the side.]
<Kagome:    yappari atashi...>
Kagome: I wonder if I really am...
<Kagome:    NIBANME na no ka na-.>
Kagome: in second place, after all.

5
[Misty frame. Scene change.]

6
[Inuyasha is sitting on a fence, sulking. Sango is leaning against it nearby.]
Fx Inuyasha: *sulkily* <buchi buchi>
<Inuyasha:    nande KATTE ni KAEraseta n-da yo.>
Inuyasha: Why did you just let her go home.
<Sango:    ichiichi nanta ni KYOKA toru koto nai desho.>
Sango: It's not like she has to get your permission every time, right?

7
[Miroku arrives.]
<Miroku:    INUYASHA, omae KAEDE-sama ni KIKYOU-sama no koto TSUTAete-ta n-darou.>
Miroku: Inuyasha, you told Kaede-sama about Kikyou-sama, didn't you.
<Inuyasha:    sore ga doushita.>
Inuyasha: What of it.



Page 6

[The three discuss things.]
<Miroku:    KOE ga kakezurai ja nai ka.
** not sure what Miroku means here. Guessing
>
Miroku: You weren't very talkative otherwise.
<Inuyasha:    nande.>
Inuyasha: So?
<Sango:    kagome-chan ga KI o TSUKAtta tte koto da yo.>
Sango: He means you should have paid more attention to Kagome-chan.

2
[Closeup of Inuyasha looking annoyed.]
<Inuyasha:    BETSU ni...>
Inuyasha: It's not like...
<Inuyasha:    KIkarete KOMAru you na HANASHI shite-ta wake ja nee zo.>
Inuyasha: there was anything troubling her that I had to ask about was there.
<Inuyasha:    ore ga WARUi no ka yo_.>
Inuyasha: What did I do wrong huh?

3
[Sango sharply points a finger at Inuyasha who looks slightly shocked.]
<Sango:    a-, mou urusai na.>
Sango: Ah, shut up already.
<Sango:    osuwari!>
Sango: Sit!
Fx Inuyasha: twitch <piku_>

4
[Sango looks curiously at Inuyasha, who looks rather annoyed.]
<Sango:    ...yappari kagome-chan de nai to KIkanai ka.>
Sango: ...I guess it only works for Kagome-chan after all.
<Inuyasha:    _tari me- daro Baka.>
Inuyasha: Of course, stupid.
Fx Inuyasha: (heart) thump-thump-thump <doki doki doki>

[Scene change. View of the modern world during the day.]

[Closeup of Kagome, dressed in her school clothes, looking slightly surprised.]
<Kagome:    e_ kono JITENSHA...>
Kagome: Eh, this bicycle...

2
[Kagome is standing outside holding a bicycle with her mother.]
<Kagome:    moratte ii no? Mama.>
Kagome: It's okay for me to have it, mama?
<mother:    SHIraiai no oFURU o moratte kita no.>
mother: I got a second-hand one from a friend.
<mother:    MUKOU de JITENSHA nakushita tte Itte-ta kara.>
mother: You said you'd lost your bicycle on the other side.

3
[Kagome is now merrily cleaning the bicycle while Souta, her younger brother
turns up.]
<Souta:    nee-chan CHIKOKU suru zo.>
Souta: Nee-chan, you'll be late.
<Kagome:    mou chotto.>
Kagome: Just a bit more.

4
[Souta talks to Kagome some more.]
<Souta:    do-se MUKOU ni MOtte-ttara sugu YOGOrechau no ni...>
Souta: I bet it'll quickly get dirty on the other side though...
<Kagome:    ii no_.>
Kagome: It's fine!

5
[Closeup of Kagome thinking to herself, smiling a bit.]
<Kagome:    yappari KORE ga nakucha.>
Kagome: .oO(It's best to use this after all.).
<Kagome:    INUYASHA no onbu mo WARUkunai kedo.>
Kagome: .oO(Being carried by Inuyasha's not too bad though.).

6
[Kagome now stands proudly before the sparklingly clean bicycle.]
Fx bicycle: *sparkle* <kira-n>
<Kagome:    yoshi_ KANPEKI_.>
Kagome: All-right! Perfect!



Page 8
1
[Inuyasha suddenly drops by, landing right on Kagome's bicycle, twisting the
handle-bar and knocking off the basket on the front.]
Fx bicycle: scrunch <gusha>

2
[Souta looks at Inuyasha happily.]
<Souta:    INU no nii-chan.>
Souta: Inu no nii-chan.
<Souta:    ASObi ni KIta no?>
Souta: Did you come to visit?
<Inuyasha:    ke_, sonna HIMA ja nee.>
Inuyasha: Bah, I don't have time for that.

3
[Inuyasha looks to the side.]
<Inuyasha:    ou, kagome.>
Inuyasha: Hey, Kagome.
<Inuyasha:    nande, ore ni KOTOWArinaku KAE_...>
Inuyasha: Why, without telling me did you come b-...

4
[Kagome is looming hugely over Inuyasha, glaring directly at Inuyasha.]
Fx Kagome: (flames of anger) ro-a-a-r <Go--->
<Inuyasha:    ta!?>
Inuyasha: ack!?



Page 9

[Closeup of Kagome speaking angrily, with a clenched fist.]
<Kagome:    nan na no yo ikinari_.>
Kagome: What's this all of a sudden!
<Kagome:    KOWArechatta ja nai no, Baka--_.>
Kagome: You've broken it haven't you, you idiot!

2
[Inuyasha has put a hand to his chest as if he's out of breath, and Kagome
is holding the bicycle looking annoyed.]
Fx Inuyasha: (heart) tmp-tmp-tmp <do_ do_ do_>
<Inuyasha:    na_ nanda yo_.>
Inuyasha: Wh, what!
<Kagome:    mo~_, MAgatte-ru shi.>
Kagome: Sheesh, it's twisted too.

3
[Inuyasha forcibly grips the handle bars.]
<Inuyasha:    ke_, konna no ko- surya MOTOdoori...>
Inuyasha: Bah, this'll put it back to normal...
Fx bicycle: squeek <gi_>

4
[The handle bars are now even more twisted, the other way. A vein on
Kagome's head pops.]
Fx bicycle: crumple <guni>
Fx Kagome: (vein) *snap* <buchi>

5
[Inuyasha looks at Kagome a bit nervously - she looks back at him, clearly annoyed.]
<Inuyasha:    naoseba ii n-daro.>
Inuyasha: It'll be fine if I fix it, okay.
<Kagome:    mou sawaranai de...>
Kagome: Don't touch it anymore...

[Scene change. View of Kagome's school - the clock reads 8:30.]

2
[View of Kagome walking, looking annoyed but calm.]
<Kagome:    _taku, nani shi ni KIta no yo aitsu.>
Kagome: .oO(Sheesh, just what did he come for.).
<Kagome:    nanka ikinari OKOtte-ru shi.>
Kagome: .oO(He got angry quickly too.).

3
[View of two of Kagome's friends - the one with short hair, and the one with
a hair-band.]
<short-hair:    a_ kagome.>
short-hair: Ah, Kagome.
<hair-band:    HISAshiburi-.>
hair-band: Long time no see!

4
[The two girls look at Kagome.]
<short-hair:    ...dou shita no?>
short-hair: ...What happened?
<hair-band:    REI no KARE to nanka atta?>
hair-band: Did something happen with that guy?
<Kagome:    e".>
Kagome: _Eh_.

5
[Scene change - the girls are now talking in class. The girl with permed
hair is there too (last seen in chapter 23).]
<short-hair:    he~ AIkawarazu FUTAMATA kakerarete-ru n-da~>
short-hair: Hmm, so you're still being two-timed huh.
<Kagome:    ma- ne, dakedo...>
Kagome: Pretty much, though...

6
[Closeup side view of Kagome.]
<Kagome:    iroiro JIJOU ga aru kara, GAMANshite-ru n-dakedo.>
Kagome: All sorts of things have happened, and I'm putting up with it.



Page 11
1
[The short-hair girl looks at Kagome a bit sadly.]
<short-hair:    wakkannai na-.>
short-hair: I just don't get it.
<short-hair:    kagome mo mou Awanakya ii no ni.>
short-hair: You should just not see him any more.
<Kagome:    shou ga nai ja nai.>
Kagome: I couldn't do anything about it.

2
[Closeup of Kagome, looking a bit annoyed.]
<Kagome:    uchi made oshikakete kuru n-dakara.>
Kagome: He even came to my house, uninvited.
<Kagome:    KYOU datte ASAppara kara...>
Kagome: He's been there since this morning...

3
[The three other girls suddenly get very interested, with little sparkles
around them.]
Fx girls: sparkle <kira-n>
<perm-hair:    e_...>
perm-hair: Eh...
<perm-hair:    ouchi ni KIte-ru no?>
perm-hair: He's at your house?
<Kagome:    e...>
Kagome: Eh...?

4
[Scene change back to Inuyasha, who's tempting fate by trying to fix
Kagome's bicycle. He has one hand on the front tire and another on the handle-bar.]
Fx Inuyasha: *sulk sulk* <buchi buchi>
Fx handle-bar: squeek-squeek <gi_ gi_>
Fx tire: sque-e-ze <gyu->
<Inuyasha:    ke_ konna mon,>
Inuyasha: Bah, no problem.
<Inuyasha:    koko o kou shite.>
Inuyasha: Just do this here, and...

5
[Inuyasha jerks in surprise as his hand on the tire (which has sharp nails)
digs in, puncturing the tire.]
Fx tire: pow <pan>
Fx air: (leaking) fshhh- <pushu-->
Fx Inuyasha: urk <giku_>

6
[To stop the air leaking, Inuyasha grips the whole wheel, squeezing it out
of shape.]
Fx tire: *grip* <gyu_>
Fx wheel: crunch <gunya>



Page 12
1
[Scene change to Kagome walking up the steps to her house. Her three friends
are with her, looking excited. Kagome seems a bit tense and depressed.]
<short-hair:    donna KARE kashira.>
short-hair: I wonder what he's like.
<short-hair:    Wagamama FUTAMATA BOURYOKU OTOKO.>
short-hair: This self, two-timing, violent guy.
<perm-hair:    TANOshimi~>
perm-hair: I can't wait!
<Kagome:    masaka tsuite kuru to wa...>
Kagome: .oO(I never thought they'd come with me...).

2
[Kagome forces a smile and looks back at her friends, having reached the top
of the stairs.]
<Kagome:    ne, nee, minna JUKEN de ISOGAshii n-da shi,>
Kagome: S, say, you all have cram school don't you,
<Kagome:    konna koto shite-ru BAAI ja...>
Kagome: so you shouldn't be doing this...

3
[The girls insist, and Kagome panics slightly.]
<hair-band:    ii no yo.>
hair-band: It's fine.
<short-hair:    sore ni, kagome o KURUshimeru na tte MONKU Itte yannakucha.>
short-hair: Besides, we gotten tell him to not make you suffer, Kagome.
<Kagome:    yamete_, ABAreDAsu kara_.>
Kagome: Don't! He'd go berserk!

4
[Closeup of Kagome looking nervous and worried.]
<Kagome:    mazui... INUYASHA to Awasecha...>
Kagome: .oO(This is bad... If I let them meet Inuyasha...).
<Kagome:    SETSUMEI suru no wa mendou da shi..>
Kagome: .oO(it'll be hard to explain for one thing...).

5
[Kagome's three friends look at something, a bit confused - a twisted piece
of metal. Some kind of modern art? No, it's Kagome's bicycle and she's
staring at it in shock and anger.]
Fx bicycle: crumpled... <gusha...>
<hair-band:    n?>
hair-band: Hm?
<short-hair:    nani? are...>
short-hair: What is that...?



Page 13
1
[Closeup of Kagome, raging.]
Fx Kagome: (veins) *snap snap snap* <buchi buchi buchi>
<Kagome:    INUYASHA-->
Kagome: Inuyasha-a-a

2
[The three girls talk to each other a bit confused.]
hair-band: ...?
<short-hair:    KARESHI no NAMAE...?>
short-hair: Her boyfriend's name...?
<perm-hair:    Team-MEI ja nai? Yanki- nan desho?>
perm-hair: His gang name? He's in one right?
<Kagome:    chotto iru n-desho!?>
Kagome: You're there aren't you!?

(    Giving yourself a name ending with "yasha" would be reasonable for someone
wanting a "tough guy" image.)

3
[The scene shifts to nearby where Inuyasha is inside a small room, helping
Kagome's grandfather with some cleaning it seems. They both have clothes
over their hair (which hides Inuyasha's ears).]
<grandad:    ...kagome ga YOndo-ru you daga.>
grandad: ...It sounds like Kagome is calling you.
<Inuyasha:    KI no sei daro.>
Inuyasha: Probably your imagination.
Fx Inuyasha: (heart) thump-thump-thump <doki doki doki>

4
[Kagome's grandfather points up at a pot high on a shelf, and Inuyasha
starts to take it down.]
<grandad:    a, sono Tsubo kocchi ni TANOmu.>
grandad: Ah, please bring that pot here.
<Inuyasha:    kore ka.>
Inuyasha: This huh.

5
[Closeup of the old man.]
<grandad:    ZETTAI WAru na yo.>
grandad: Absolutely do not break it.
<grandad:    sore wa YUISHODADAshii Tsubo de na...>
grandad: That is a historic pot, you know...

6
[The scene shifts to Kagome, who is standing angrily.]
Fx Kagome: *deep breath* <su--->



Page 14
1
[Closeup of Kagome speaking forcefully.]
<Kagome:    osuwari_.>
Kagome: Sit!

2
[Inside the room, Inuyasha collapses to the ground, crushing the pot, and
the whole shelf.]
Fx shelf: ka-runch <dogasha-n>
Fx pieces: clatter clatter <gara gara>
<Grandad:    o~~~~i!>
Grandad: He~e~e~e~y!

3
[Kagome and the others look to the side.]
<Inuyasha:    ore ja ne-_.>
Inuyasha: {off} It wasn't me!
short-hair and hair-band: Hm?

4
[Kagome dashes off.]
<Kagome:    NAYA ka.>
Kagome: .oO(The shed, huh.).
Fx Kagome: whizz <gyun>
<perm-hair:    a...>
perm-hair: Ah...
<hair-band:    kagome-.>
hair-band: Kagome-e.

5
[Kagome arrives in the shed, stiff with anger still. There's no sign of
Inuyasha but her grandfather is looking dejectedly at the mess.]
<Kagome:    jii-chan INUYASHA wa!?>
Kagome: Jii-chan, where's Inuyasha!?
<grandad:    NIgeta.>
grandad: He ran.
Fx grandad: *sob sob sob* <shiku shiku shiku>

6
[Closeup of Kagome.]
<Kagome:    _taku...>
Kagome: Sheesh...
<Kagome:    KOWAsu dake KOWAshite...>
Kagome: He just breaks and breaks things...

7
[A bit later, all four girls at in Kagome's room.]
<Kagome:    nanka KAEchatta mitai.>
Kagome: It seems like he's left.
<perm-hair:    tsumanna-i.>
perm-hair: Bo-o-ring.



Page 15
1
[Closeup of Kagome, who seems slightly stressed out, and not quite sure what
to think.]
<Kagome:    ma... yokatta ka na.>
Kagome: .oO(Well... I guess this is for the best.).
<Kagome:    yappa Hen da mon, aitsu...>
Kagome: .oO(He is a bit odd...).

2
[Kagome walks out of the room.]
<mother:    kagome- oCHAtori ni irassha-i.
** bit of a guess for "ocha-tori ni irasshai"
>
mother: {off} Kagome-e, come help bring the tea.
<Kagome:    ha-i.>
Kagome: Coming.
Fx Kagome: tmp tmp <tota tota>

3
[The three girls look a bit dejected.]
<perm-hair:    ZANNEN~ MItakatta-.>
perm-hair: What a shame, I wanted to see him.

4
[Suddenly, Inuyasha enters, through Kagome's window (opening it first). He's
still wearing the cloth over his head, hiding his ears.]
Fx window: skish <guwara>
<Inuyasha:    kuora kagome_.>
Inuyasha: Hey Kagome you bitch!
<Inuyasha:    teme- KESA kara nani OKOtte...>
Inuyasha: What've you been angry about since this morning...

5
[A frozen moment. Inuyasha stops and looks at the three girls. The three
girls stare back at the unexpected visitor.]

6
[The three girls crowd together in anticipation.]
Fx girls: *look up* <sa sa_>
<short-hair:    chotto.>
short-hair: Just a sec.
<hair-band:    kore, moshikashite...>
hair-band: Could he be...

7
[Closeup of Inuyasha.]
<Inuyasha:    kagome to ONAji KIMONO da.>
Inuyasha: Those are the same clothes as Kagome.
<Inuyasha:    omee-ra NAKAMA ka?>
Inuyasha: Are you lot friends?



Page 16
1
[Kagome enters, carrying a tray of tea cups.]
<Kagome:    oMAtase-.>
Kagome: Sorry to keep you waiting.

2
[Kagome does a big prat-fall to find Inuyasha sitting down, the three girls
sitting around him, staring intently.]
Fx Kagome: blam <do-n>
<hair-band:    kagome to itsu kara tsukiatte n-no.>
hair-band: How long have you been going out with Kagome?
<Inuyasha:    KEKKOU NAGEe zo.>
Inuyasha: Quite a while.
<short-hair:    JINJA de Baito shite n-no?>
short-hair: Do you work at the shrine?
Fx girls: *stare stare stare* <jiro jiro jiro>

(    When the hair-band girl says "going out with", in Japanese it's more
general - it can apply both to "dating" and a more neutral "accompany". The
short-hair girl is probably guessing that Inuyasha works at the shrine from
his clothes, and that he's been there all day.)

3
[The girls continue to talk with Inuyasha.]
<hair-band:    nanka... kawatta ME no IRO shite-ru-.>
hair-band: You have... a kinda unusual eye colour..
<perm-hair:    KAMI, DASSHOKU shite-te n-no?>
perm-hair: Have you bleached your hair?
<Inuyasha:    kore wa Umaretsuki dei_.>
Inuyasha: I was born this way!
<short-hair:    hee_.>
short-hair: Ooh!

4
[Kagome looks on almost in disbelief.]
<Kagome:    na... nanka KAIWA ga SEIRITSUshite-ru shi.>
Kagome: .oO(Th... they seem to be managing to have a conversation.).
Fx Kagome: (heart) thump-thump-thump <doki doki doki>

5
[While the others look at Inuyasha, the short-haired girl looks towards Kagome.]
<hair-band:    moshikashite Ha-fu?>
hair-band: Could it be that you're half?
<Inuyasha:    ha-fu?>
Inuyasha: Harf?
<short-hair:    kagome, dou na no!?>
short-hair: Kagome, which is it!?

(    The girls are asking if Inuyasha is "half" (in Japlish, "haafu"), which is
slang for "half Japanese half foreign". Of course, Inuyasha doesn't know
what the word means. It is not an unreasonable question since the only
people in Japan with naturally light coloured hair are foreigners (or mixed
blood) - everyone else has black hair or dark brown. This is why it is
common for manga (and anime) characters to have more unusual hair-styles -
makes it easier to tell them apart, compared to all having black hair.)

6
[Kagome considers this.]
<Kagome:    u, un... maa...>
Kagome: Uh, yeah... pretty much...
<Kagome:    HANYOU da shi...>
Kagome: .oO(He is Half-Youkai for one thing...).



Page 17
1
[Kagome's friends get quite excited about this, to Kagome's surprise.]
<hair-band:    ya~n kakkoi~>
hair-band: Wow~w! Cool!
<Kagome:    eee!?>
Kagome: .oO(Eeeh!?).

(    Kagome is probably surprised that they didn't think Inuyasha was weird.
Having long, blond hair is considered very cool...)

2
[Time passes. It's now dark, and the front door to Kagome's house slides open.]
<hair-band:    oJAMAshimashita-.>
hair-band: Thanks for hanving me.
Fx door: clatter clatter <Garara>

3
[Kagome sees her friends off.]
<Kagome:    baibai.>
Kagome: Bye-bye.
<hair-band:    kagome~ KARE, Iu hodo hidoku nai ja nai.>
hair-band: Kagome, he's not as bad as you said.

4
[The girls discuss things, while Kagome looks on, uncertain.]
<perm-hair:    tekkiri TOKKOU FUKU KIte Mayu-GE no nai HITO ka to OMOtte-ta.>
