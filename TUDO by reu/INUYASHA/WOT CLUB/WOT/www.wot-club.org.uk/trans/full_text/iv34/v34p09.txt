Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

<Kohaku:    JIYUU ni naritai n-daro?>
Kohaku: You want to be free don't you?

(    Kohaku said "Kagura-sama" before. He's clearly being quite openly
different. He probably thinks that he's given himself away to Naraku so
can't afford to wait anymore.)

<Shippou:    NAGAi aisatsu ja nou.>
Shippou: It's a long chat.
Kagome: ......

[Closeup of Kagome thinking, a bit sadly.]

<Inuyasha:    NANDO KARADA o KUDAitemo yatsu wa SHInanee.>

4
[Closeup of Kikyou.]
<Kikyou:    yatsu no SHINZOU ga KARADA no SOTO ni aru to iu koto da.>
Kikyou: It means that he has taken his heart outside of his body.

Inuyasha: .oO(His heart...).
<Inuyasha:    FUYOUHEKI de KAKUsou to shita no wa socchi ka.>
