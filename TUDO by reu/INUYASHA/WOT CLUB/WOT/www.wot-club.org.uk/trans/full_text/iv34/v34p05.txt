Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

(    "Yadori Sanagi" is the name of a Youkai. It roughly translates as "lodging pupa".)

<villager:    KOROsu WAKE ni ikazu...>
villager: killing it would be unthinkable...

2
[Inuyasha and co are inside the house, with food prepared for them, with an
old-ish man bowing deeply to them (he's probably the village head)]
<villager:    dewa goyururi to.>

4
[Inuyasha continues his rant, and Miroku gives him a look.]
<Inuyasha:    sou de naku ta tte, TEgakari ga nakute Iraira shite-ru tte no ni yo-.>
Inuyasha: Even without this, it's very irritating that we don't have any clues.
