Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

<Title:    MAYOSE>
Title: Mayose

(    I couldn't find this word in any dictionary, even my Shinto dictionary, or
on-line. Anyway, it pretty simply translates as "demon bring" or "demon gather".)

[Closeup of Miroku and Sango.]
<Miroku:    SANGO, ZUSHI-NEZUMI KItta BUN dake Fueru to Itta na.>
Miroku: Sango, you said that the Zushi Nezumi only increase when they're cut.
<Sango:    un...>
Sango: Yeah...
<Sango:    KIttemo SHInanai kara, FUeru IPPOU da.>
Sango: Since they don't die even if you cut them, they just increase.

2
[Closeup side view of Sango.]
<Sango:    sore dake HIROgatte shimattara...>
Sango: Since they've increased so damn much...
<Sango:    DEDOKORO ga wakaranai.>
Sango: we can't tell where their source is.

3
[View of Miroku and Sango.]
<Miroku:    DEDOKORO to wa, ZUSHI no koto da na.>
Miroku: By source, you mean the Zushi, right?
<Sango:    un.>
Sango: Yeah.
<Sango:    ZUSHI o KOWAseba NEZUMI wa KIeru to KIita koto ga aru.>
Sango: I've heard that if you break the Zushi, the rats will disappear.

[Shippou is giving Inuyasha a dubious look, and Inuyasha looks a bit annoyed.]
<Shippou:    INUYASHA wa Ka-tto naru to sugu KATANA o FUriMAWAshite, NEZUMI o FUyashite shimau kara jaro.>
Shippou: Probably because if you got into a rage, you'd quickly start swining your sword around, increasing the number of rats.
<Inuyasha:    temee, sore wa ore ga Baka da tte koto ka?>
Inuyasha: You bastard, so you're saying I'm an idiot huh?

2
[Kagome stands up, looking out of the barrier.]
<Kagome:    INUYASHA, are...>
Kagome: Inuyasha, look at that...

[Vie wof Kagome and Inuyasha, considering the situation/]
<Kagome:    sore ja ZUSHI NEZUMI no BOUSOU wa NARAKU no shiawaza...>
Kagome: Then it was Naraku's doing that the Zushi Nezumi went out of control...
<Inuyasha:    ke_,>
Inuyasha: Bah!
<Inuyasha:    sonna kottarou to OMOtta ze.>
Inuyasha: I thought so anyway!

[Shippou looks up to see Sango and Miroku arriving.]
<Shippou:    a_ MODOtte KIta zo.>
Shippou: Ah, they're back.

3
[The group is now discussing things inside the cave.]
<Miroku:    kagome-SAMA-tachi mo MImashita ka, SAIMYOUSHOU o...>
Miroku: So you saw the Saimyoushou took huh, Kagome-sama...
<Kagome:    un.>
Kagome: Yeah.

4
[Shippou is talking to Miroku.]
<Shippou:    NARAKU no yatsu, ora-tachi o SAGAshiDAshite SHIKAEshi suru tsumori jaro ka.>
Shippou: I wonder if that Naraku is searching for us to get revenge.
<Miroku:    ...to iu tori mo...>

5
[Closeup of Miroku.]
<Miroku:    USHIro de ITO o HIite iru no wa NARAKU da to, aete MIsetsukete iru KANji da.>
