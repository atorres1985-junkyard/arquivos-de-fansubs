Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

to a vine covered rock face.]
<Title:    ZUSHI NEZUMI>
Title: Zushi Nezumi

(    A "zushi" is a shrine in a box with doors, which you often see in homes as
a shrine to dead members of the family for example. "Nezumi" simply
translates as "rat" or "mouse", though in this case "rat" seems most appropriate.)

[The rat turns around to look to the side. As well as a two normal though
dark eyes, it also has a huge round eye in the center of it's forehead.]

Hakudoushi: {off} You let your underlings eat the flesh of your prey,
<Hakudoushi:    JIBUN wa HONE o KUu...>
Hakudoushi: and you eat the bones...

[Hakudoushi is standing by himself near the door, which has been knocked
down (probably by the rat earlier).]

[Misty frame. Scene change.]

4
[View of some tree tops during the day.]
Fx leaves: rustle... <Sawa...>

[Inuyasha is standing before a large tree. Where he last met Kikyou?]
Fx Inuyasha: sh <Za_>

[Closeup of Inuyasha with little expression.]
<Inuyasha:    KIKYOU...>
Inuyasha: .oO(Kikyou...).
<Inuyasha:    mata dokoka ni MI o KAKUshita n-da na.>
Inuyasha: .oO(You've hidden yourself somewhere again, haven't you.).

2
[Vague drawing of Kikyou.]
<Inuyasha:    mada... MOTO no CHIKARA ga MODOtte nee no ka.>
Inuyasha: .oO(You still... haven't returned to your original strength huh.).

3
[Scene change. Sango, Kirara, Miroku, Shippou and Kagome are sitting near a
rough track through a forest.]
<Sango:    OSOi ne INUYASHA.>
Sango: Inuyasha is late, isn't he.
<Shippou:    nou, kagome, yahari ora-tachi mo ISSHO ni Iku beki dewa nakatta no ka?>
Shippou: Say, Kagome, on second thoughts, wouldn't it have been better if we had gone as well?

4
[View of Kagome resting her head on her hands looking off into the distance.]
<Kagome:    KIKYOU to FUTARI kiri de HANAshitakatta n-ja nai?>
Kagome: He wanted to talk to Kikyou alone didn't he?
<Shippou:    kagome wa doushite sou made KOKORO ga HIROi no ja.>
Shippou: Why are you so open minded, Kagome?

5
[Closeup of Shippou sucking a sweet (that Kagome probably gave to him)]
<Shippou:    HON_TOU ni INUYASHA wa KOMAtta yatsu ja.>
Shippou: Inuyasha _really_ is a troublesome guy.



Page 7

[Closeup of Shippou looking annoyed.]
<Shippou:    itsumademo MUKASHI no ONNA ni SHIPPO o futte matowari tsukiotte.>
Shippou: He's forever wagging his tail and sticking to his previous woman.
<Shippou:    TASHIkani, INU wa MIKKA KAttara ON wa WASUren to ka iu ga...>
Shippou: It's true that "feed a dog for three days and it's gateful forver" but...

(    There is a Japanese proverb "Feed a dog for three days and it is gratefull
for three years. Feed a cat for three years and it forgets after three
days." Shippou doesn't say "grateful for three years", so I left it open
ended. "Feed" doesn't quite give the same sense as the Japanese world, but
is probably the closest - it also means to "raise" (as in raise animals),
and basiclly look after an animal.)

2
[Inuyasha suddenly appears, booting Shippou into the air.]
Fx Shippou: {comicly} pow <Do-n>
<Inuyasha:    DARE ga Kwareta.>
Inuyasha: Who got raised.

3

[Closeup side view of Inuyasha.]
<Inuyasha:    KIKYOU wa... inakatta.>
Inuyasha: Kikyou... wasn't there.

5
[Kagome talks to Inuyasha, who looks a bit surprised/puzzeled.]
<Kagome:    ...Uso tsukanakute ii no ni.>
Kagome: ...You don't have to lie about it.
<Inuyasha:    aa?>
Inuyasha: Huh?



Page 8
1
[Closeup of Inuyasha looking faintly annoyed.]
<Inuyasha:    nande ore ga Uso tsukanakya nanne- n-da yo.>
Inuyasha: Why would I necessarily have to lie about it.
<Inuyasha:    ba---ka.>
Inuyasha: Mo-o-o-ron.

2
[Closeup of Kagome.]
<Kagome:    osuwari.>
Kagome: Sit.

3
[Kagome is now angrily yelling at Inuyasha, who's stuck to the ground.]
<Kagome:    HITO ga sekkaku KI o TSUKAtte HITORI de Ikasete ageta no ni.>
Kagome: Just when I was considerate enough to let you go alone too!
<Kagome:    nani HANAshita ka kurai Iinasai yo, osuwari_.>
Kagome: You could at least tell me what you talked about! Sit!
Fx Inuyasha: {comicly} squishh... <giuuu>
<Inuyasha:    ya~me~ro~>
Inuyasha: Stop tha~a~at
<Miroku:    kagome-SAMA, yahari KIZUtsuite orareta no ka.>
Miroku: So Kagome-sama was hurt about it after all huh.

4
[Sango and Shippou look on sadly. Behind them, Inuyasha sits up and glares
at them.]
<Sango:    kawaisou na kagome-chan.>
Sango: Poor Kagome-chan.
<Shippou:    KOKORO ga HIROi to SON ja nou.>
Shippou: You suffer if you're open minded, indeed.
<Inuyasha:    omae-ra...>
Inuyasha: Why you bunch of...

creatures - a writhing carpet. A horse (?) can be seen - most of it's flesh
has been eaten away.]
Fx creatures: rustle-rustle <Zazaza>

4
[View of inside a house - two skeletons can be seen, and presumably all
their flesh has just been eaten.]

5
[Scene change. View of Inuyasha and co traveling along, seeing something ahead.]

Sango: Inuyasha!
<Sango:    KIru na!!>
Sango: Don't cut them!!
<Kagome:    SANGO-chan!?>
Kagome: Sango-chan!?

2
[Too late - Inuyasha has already swung Tetsusaiga, and can't stop his stroke.]
Fx Tetsusaiga: whizz <Gyan>
<Inuyasha:    na!?>
Inuyasha: Wha!?

[A bunch of the rats are sliced.]

<Sango:    soitsu wa, MOtte iru ZUSHI no NAKA ni NEZUMI-tachi o KAtte ite,>
Sango: That one keeps the other rats in the box it carries,
<Sango:    soitsu-ra o HANAtte NINGEN ya DOUBUTSU o KOROsaseru...>
Sango: It frees them to attack humans and animals...

5
[View of Sango.]
<Sango:    dakedo... OSOu no wa JIBUN ga KUu BUN dake de,>
Sango: However... they should only attack to eat what they need,
<Sango:    TAIGUN de MURA o OSOu nante KIita koto nai yo.>

6
[Closeup side view of Inuyasha looking to the side.]

Hakudoushi: Kukuku... Before long this country will be eaten by the rats.

(    At this time period, "country" would be like the local area - area of
influence of the local fuedal lord. Several hundred villages at least, probably.)

<Kohaku:    KIKYOU wa...>
Kohaku: Will Kikyou...
