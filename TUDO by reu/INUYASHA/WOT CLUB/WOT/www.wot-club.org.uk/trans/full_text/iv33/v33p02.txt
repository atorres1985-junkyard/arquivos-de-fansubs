Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

father's skeleton behind him.]
<Title:    TODOkanu YA>
Title: Inadequate Arrow

(    A tricky title to translate this time - the Japanese is simply "Todokanu
Ya". The most literal translation would be "the arrow(s) don't reach" which
sounds rather weird. Another way to translate it would be "the arrow(s)
don't reach [far enough]". "Inadequate" doesn't really give the
same feel, but it's the simplest reasonable translation I can think of.)
