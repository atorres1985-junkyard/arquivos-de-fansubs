Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

of surprised/intense expression.]

[View of Inuyasha's father's huge skeleton in the boundry world.]
Fx ground: rumble... <Gooooo....>

[View of Inuyasha and Kagome on a skeletal bird, facing the crystal Youkai
which is attached to the armour on Inuyasha's father.]
Fx youkai: *pulse of energy* Dokun<>
<Inuyasha:    nan nan da temee wa.>
Inuyasha: What the heck's with you.
<Inuyasha:    HITO no oyaji no HARA n-NAKA ni KATTE ni SUKUi yagatte.>
Inuyasha: Sticking yourself to my dad's belly just as you please.

[Closeup of the skull in the center of the crystals.]
<youkai:    oyaji... da to...?>
youkai: Your... father...?

2
[The crystals shards align facing forwards, and the skull moves with them
(coming closer to Inuyasha). In each eye socket there is now a dull glowing light.]
Fx shards: crick crick <Baki Baki Baki>
Fx lights: *glow...* <Bou...>

3
[Side view of the Youkai taking a closer look at Inuyasha, now just a short
distance seperating them. This gives a good perspective on just how big
this Youkai is - it's skull is about 1m tall.]
Fx shards: crick... <Paki...>
<youkai:    omae ga... INU no TAISHOU no MUSUKO da to iu no ka.>
youkai: You're saying... you are the son of the leader of the dogs huh?

(    We still don't have a name of Inuyasha's father. This Youkai uses the same
phrase Toutousai used to refer to Inuyasha's father - "inu no taishou", the
general/boss/leader etc of the dogs.)

[View of Myouga bouncing on Inuyasha's shoulder.]
<Myouga:    INUYASHA-sama, kono SHAREKOUBE wa moshika suru to...>

<Sango:    HOUSENKI tte...>

<Miroku:    IZEN, INUYASHA no tame ni KUROSHINJU o TSUKUtta to iu...>
Miroku: We heard before that in the past he created the Black Pearl for Inuyasha...

[Closeup of the skull.]
<Housenki:    MYOUGA... ka.>
Housenki: Myouga... huh.
<Housenki:    suru to sono KOSEGARE wa INUYASHA da na...>
Housenki: So then this is his son, Inuyasha then...

2
[View of the skull.]
<Housenki:    iware mo naku FUTATAbi, kono SHISHA no BA ni KUru koto wa YURUsarenu.>
Housenki: There is no reason why you can be allowed to come to this place of the dead again.

3
[View of Kagome.]
<Housenki:    NANIBITO tari to mo na...>
Housenki: {off} No matter who you are...
<Kagome:    a, ano_.>
Kagome: U, excuse me!

4
[View of Housenki, with a glowing light coming from near the skull. Overlaid
is a view of Kagome.]

[Flashback drawing to when Housenki was alive - he is sitting in that large
clam his son was in.]

4
[View of Inuyasha and Kagome.]
<Housenki:    SHIKON no kakera no TAIHAN wa, Ashiki MONO no SHUCHUU ni ari KEGArete iru.>
Housenki: {off} Most of the Shikon fragments were in the hands on an evil being, and were corrupted.

5
[Misty frame.]
<Housenki:    sore-ra to MAJIwareba, washi no TE ni shita kakera mo mata KEGAreru.>
Housenki: {off} If it got mixed with the others, the one I have would be corrupted as well.

[View of the world, with bare rocky mountains and lots of mist.]
<Housenki:    dakara koso Ashiki MONO no TE no TODOkanu TOKORO...>
Housenki: Which is exactly why, the Shikon fragment's wish...
<Housenki:    kono YOUKAI no HAKABA ni...>
Housenki: was to come with me to a place...

[View of Housenki.]

Miroku: The Shikon fragment should be good or bad depending upon the owner's heart, but...

4
[Closeup of Miroku.]
<Miroku:    SAKI hodo no HANASHI kara mo,>
Miroku: Based on the earlier conversation as well,
<Miroku:    HOUSENKI ga SHIRI SHOUYOKU de SHIKON no kakera o MOtte kita to wa OMOen.>
Miroku: I don't think Housenki brought the Shikon fragment here for his own sake.
<Miroku:    ...to naru to.>

2
[Miroku looks over at Kagome, while Sango is looking at Housenki.]
<Sango:    NARAKU no SHIKON no kakera EIKYOU tte koto ka.>
Sango: It's the influence of Naraku's Shikon fragments huh.
<Miroku:    kagome-SAMA NARAKU wa...>
Miroku: Kagome-sama, Naraku is...
<Miroku:    NARAKU no IBASHO wa!?>

<Inuyasha:    sono mamma kakera o kakae kondetara...>

[Closeup of Inuyasha shouting.]
<Inuyasha:    KEGAreta kakera ni TAMASHII o KUware chimau zo.>

Inuyasha: Let go of it right now.

3
[Closeup of Housenki, getting even more menacing.]
Fx shards: crick crick <Paki Paki Paki>
<Housenki:    SHOUSHI...>

<Housenki:    kore gotoki no KEGAre de...>
Housenki: This measly amount of corruption...
<Housenki:    ONORE o USHINAu HOUSENKI dewa nai wa.>

Housenki: I won't... hand it... to... anyone...
Fx shards: crack crack <Baki Baki Baki>
Fx fragment: *pulse of energy* <Dokun>

(    The font for Housenki's words has changed to the "monster" type -
basically, he's lost himself enough that he can't speak smoothly anymore.)

2
[Closeup of Inuyasha looking a bit frustrated.]
<Inuyasha:    chi_ KEKKYOKU...>
Inuyasha: .oO(Damn! In the end...).
<Inuyasha:    CHIKARAzuku de TOru shika nee ka.>
