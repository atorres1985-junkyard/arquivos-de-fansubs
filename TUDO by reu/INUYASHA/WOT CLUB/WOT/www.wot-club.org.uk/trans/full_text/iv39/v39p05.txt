Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

normal. However, she is carrying a long sword with a dark aura.]

[Scene change. View of some trees.]

<Kagome:    SHIPPOU-cha-n.>

<Inuyasha:    _taku, doko de ASOnde yagaru.>
Inuyasha: Sheesh, where is he playing.

5
[Kagome spots Shippou's broken spinning top.]
<Kagome:    a...>
Kagome: Ah...
<Inuyasha:    n"? SHIPPOU no KOMA!?>
Inuyasha: Hm? Shippou's top!?



Page 14

[View of a large tree, with a large underground entrance.]
Fx leaves: rustle... <Zawa...>

2
[View of some steps leading down from the entrance.]
<Shippou:    korya.>

<Shippou:    konna TOKORO ni TSUre kondemo MUDA ja.>
Shippou: There's no point bringing me down here.

3
[Inside the cave/den, Shippou is on a bunch of (human?) skulls, with the
Youkai-girl nearby. Shippou is tied up with rope and looks agitated.]
<Shippou:    INUYASHA wa HANA ga kiku n-ja.>
Shippou: Inuyasha has a good sense of smell.
<Shippou:    sugu ni KAgitsukete KUru zo.>

[Closeup of Shippou shouting angrily.]
<Shippou:    naze konna koto o suru_.>
Shippou: Why are you doing this!?

2
[Closeup of the girl holding up the sword.]
<youkai-girl:    kore ni...>
youkai-girl: To let this...
<youkai-girl:    YOURYOKU o SUwaseru tame da.>
youkai-girl: suck up Youkai-energy.

3
[She partly draws the evil looking sword.]
<youkai-girl:    kore wa YOUTOU "DAKKI" to itte naa,>
youkai-girl: This is the dark sword "Daki".
<youkai-girl:    TATAKAu AITE no YOURYOKU o UBAiTOtte, TSUYOku BAkeru KATANA da.>
youkai-girl: It becomes stronger by taking Youkai-energy from opponents.

(    "Dakki" here means "asorbing demon" or "stealing demon".)

4
[Shippou looks at the girl.]
<Shippou:    moshiya MORI no YOUKAI-domo o OiDAshite ita no mo omae ka_.>
Shippou: Could it be that you're the one driving the Youkai from the forest?
<youkai-girl:    fu_.>
youkai-girl: Heh.
<youkai-girl:    kono Mujina-SAMA sa.>
youkai-girl: Yeah, me, the great Mujina.

(    Mujina doesn't have any kanji associated with her name. However, there is a
type of Youkai called "Mujina" (faceless), which sometimes make cliche
apperances in anime and manga - someone human-looking turning around and
having a blank face is a mujina. Anyway, Mujina here refers to herself as
"Mujina-sama" - she obviously has a high opinion of herself, but this is
hard to translate. This doesn't necessarily mean that Mujina is a
"faceless" though.)

5
[View of Mujina holding up the sword.]
<Mujina:    YOWAi yatsu no YOURYOKU kara dondon SUtte yatta.>
Mujina: I've been rapidly sucking up the Youkai-energy from weaklings.
<Mujina:    daga...>
Mujina: However...



Page 16
1
[Closeup side view of Mujina.]
<Mujina:    ano HANYOU no KATANA wa TSUYOsugiru.>
Mujina: That Half-Youkai's sword is too strong.
<Mujina:    ikinari KIritsukeraretara, YOURYOKU o SUu MAE ni KOROsarete shimau.>
Mujina: If he quickly tried to cut me, I'll be killed before I can suck up with Youkai-energy.

2
[Mujina turns to Shippou.]
<Mujina:    daga omae ga ISSHO nara,>
Mujina: But since you'll be with me,
<Mujina:    yatsu mo muyami ni KATANA o FUrimawasen darou kara na.>
Mujina: he won't be able to swing around his sword carelessly.

3
[Outside, Kagome and Inuyasha approach the tree.]
<Kagome:    ano KI no SHITA?>
Kagome: Under that tree?
<Inuyasha:    aa, MACHIGAinee.>
Inuyasha: Yeah, there's no mistake.

4
[Inuyasha starts to draw Tetsusaiga.]
<Inuyasha:    SHIPPOU to YOUKAI no NIOi ga punpun shi yagaru ze.>
Inuyasha: It stinks of Shippou and a Youkai.
Fx Tetsusaiga: shing <Sha_>

5
[Inside, Shippou suddenly looks nervous.]
<Inuyasha:    KAZE no KIZU!>
Inuyasha: {off} Kaze no Kizu! (Cutting Wind)
<Shippou:    n"!?>
Shippou: _Eh_!?

<Shippou:    dee!>
Shippou: Yeek!
<Mujina:    ge.>
Mujina: Damn.

2
[Mujina grabs Shippou and runs off.]
Fx rocks: clatter clatter <Gara Gara Gara>
Fx Shippou: *grab* <Ba_>
<Mujina:    chikishou.>
Mujina: Dammit.

3
[Outside, Kagome shouts at Inuyasha who falls to the ground.]
<Inuyasha:    INUYASHA osuwari_!>
Inuyasha: Inuyasha, sit!
Fx Inuyasha: splat <gusha>



Page 18
1
[Inuyasha looks at Kagome angrily.]
<Inuyasha:    nani shi yagaru!>
Inuyasha: What the fuck are you doing!?
<Kagome:    SHIPPOU-chan ga ISSHO na no yo.>
Kagome: Shippou-chan is there too.
<Kagome:    Kega-shitara dou sun-no.>
Kagome: What if you injure him?

2
[Meanwhile, Mujina is running through a back entrance.]
<Mujina:    kuso_, YOKOANA ga nakattara ABUnai tokoro datta.>
Mujina: Damn! If there wasn't a cave here, I'd be in trouble.

3
[Closeup of Mujina.]
<Mujina:    dou yara ano HANYOU,>
Mujina: It seems that Half-Youkai,
<Mujina:    omae no INOCHI nanzo dou demo ii rashii na.>
Mujina: doesn't give a damn about your life.

4
[Closeup of Shippou looking angry.]
<Shippou:    INUYASHA~>
Shippou: .oO(Inuyasha-a!).
<Shippou:    ZETTAI ni YURUsanu zo.>
Shippou: .oO(I definitely won't forgive you.).
