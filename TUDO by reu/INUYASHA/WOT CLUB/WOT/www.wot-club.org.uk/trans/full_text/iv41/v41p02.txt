Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

<Title:    MEIOUJUU>
Title: Meioujuu

(    The kanji for "meiou" here are the same as in Meiou-sei (Planet Pluto in
Japanese), and means "dark king". The whole "meioujuu" would mean "dark
king beast".)

following behind, with Rin on the two-headed dragon.]

<Rin:    kore nani?>

[View of Sesshoumaru glancing to the side.]

[Closeup side view of Sesshoumaru looking ahead again.]
<Sesshoumaru:    MEIOUJUU da.>
Sesshoumaru: That's Meioujuu.

3
[View of Rin and Jaken looking into the water.]
<Rin:    MEIOUJUU...?>
Rin: Meioujuu...?
<Rin:    suggoi KOURA.>
Rin: What a shell it has.
<Jaken:    sorya sou ja.>

Jaken: is said to be the hardest, among all Youkai.

2
[View of the three, with Sesshoumaru walking off. Jaken glances at Sesshoumaru.]
<Jaken:    YO no NAKA HIROshi to iedomo MEIOUJUU no KOURA o KIru CHIKARA ga aru no wa,>
Jaken: Even though the world is full of marvels, maybe it's the case that,
<Jaken:    SESSHOUMARU-sama kurai dewa arumai ka na?>
Jaken: .oO(only Sesshoumaru-sama has the power to cut Meioujuu's shell?).
<Jaken:    to, sarigenaku Goma o suru washi.>
Jaken: .oO(I'm just casually brown-nosing.).
Fx Jaken: *glance* <chira_>

Rin: Ah! Jaken-sama,
<Rin:    KOURA ga ICHIMAI hagarete-ru ne.>

<Jaken:    e">

[View of Rin and Jaken talking to each other.]
<Rin:    DAREka ga yatta no ka na?>
Rin: I wonder if someone did that?
<Jaken:    ...SHIru ka.>
Jaken: ...How would I know.

6
[View of Sesshoumaru still walking away, not even glancing back.]
Fx Sesshoumaru: shh <Za_>
<Sesshoumaru:    FUDA no YAkitsuita ATO ga aru.>

<Sesshoumaru:    ookata NINGEN no BOUZU ni demo yarareta n-darou.>

Rin: Sesshoumaru-sama knows a lot about everything, doesn't he Jaken-sama.
<Jaken:    yakamashii.>
Jaken: Shut up.
<Jaken:    Gama sutto-n no ka omai wa.>
Jaken: Are you a brown-noser now?

(    Of course, Jaken is deliberately trying to suck up to Sesshoumaru, while
Rin's praise is quite innocent. Which is probably why Jaken is fairly annoyed.)
