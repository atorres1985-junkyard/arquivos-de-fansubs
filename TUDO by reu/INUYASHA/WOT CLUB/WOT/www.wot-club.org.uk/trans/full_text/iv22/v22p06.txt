Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

front of him, with a hand on the hilt. Behind him is a drawing of Kagome smiling.]
<Title:    HYAKKI MOUMORI>
Title: The Hyakki Bats

(    Perhaps the closest translation of "Hyakki Bats" would be "Terror-bats" or
similar, though Hyakki literally means "100 devils" more or less.
Incidentally, there was a character called Hyakki-maru from Tezuka Osamu's
old manga "Dororo" about the time when Rumiko Takahashi was growing up.)

[FlashBack Flashback to Naraku near the end of the last chapter.
<Naraku:    washi wa KARADA o KUmikae nagara...>
Naraku: While I recombine my body...
<Naraku:    yori TSUYOku natte iku no da...>
Naraku: I become stronger...
EndFlashBack]

[Closeup of Kagome with a slightly surprised expression.]
<Kagome:    NARAKU no KEKKAI ga...>
Kagome: Naraku's barrier...
<Kagome:    KAZE no KIZU o haneKAEshita!?>
Kagome: blocked the Cutting Wind!?

4
[The group is sitting down in Kaede's hut, and Kagome is seeing to
Inuyasha's wounds.]
<Miroku:    TASHIka ni NARAKU wa TSUYOku natte iru.>
Miroku: Naraku has certainly gotten stronger.
<Miroku:    sono UE, ONAji HANYOU to wa ie,>
Miroku: On top of that, unlike other Half-Youkai,
<Miroku:    SAKU no HI ni YOURYOKU o USHINAu INUYASHA to CHIGAtte...>
Miroku: he's different from Inuyasha who looses his Youkai-powers on the first day of the month...

1
[View of Miroku, Kaede and Sango.]
<Miroku:    NARAKU wa JIBUN no sono TOKI o ERAberu to Itte ita.>
Miroku: in that Naraku himself chooses _that time_.
<Sango:    tsumari, itsu da ka wakaranai tte koto?>
Sango: Meaning, we don't know when it'll happen?

2
[Closeup of Miroku, looking a bit down.]
<Miroku:    SUKUnakutomo NARAKU ga UGOkenu TOKI ga hakkiri wakareba,>
Miroku: At least if we correctly determine when Naraku is inactive,
<Miroku:    aruiwa TAOseru kamo shirenai to OMOtte ita no desu ga...>
Miroku: I thought we might possibly be able to defeat him, but...

3
[View of Inuyasha with Kagome looking at him.]
<Inuyasha:    ke_.>
Inuyasha: Bah!
<Inuyasha:    nani SHINKOKU na KAO shite n-dei.>
Inuyasha: What's with that grave expression.

4
[Closeup of Inuyasha.]
<Inuyasha:    docchi ni shita tte NARAKU ga UGOkenee TOKI wa aru n-da.>
Inuyasha: Whatever the case, there's a time when Naraku's inactive.
<Inuyasha:    sono AIDA ni ore ga yatsu yori TSUYOku natterya ii dake no HANASHI daro.>
Inuyasha: Until then, the situation is that I just have to become stronger than him isn't it.

5
[Closeup of Miroku looking surprised.]
<Miroku:    INUYASHA...>
Miroku: Inuyasha...

[Miroku addresses Inuyasha who edges towards Miroku looking a bit annoyed.
In the background Kaede has her eyes closed and Sango is whispering to Kagome.]
<Miroku:    omae TOKIDOKI AKArui na.>
Miroku: Sometimes you're quite positive.
<Inuyasha:    TOKIDOKI tte nanda yo.>
Inuyasha: What do you mean "positive"?
<Sango:    itsumo AKARUku FUrumatte-ru tsumori na no?>
Sango: Does he always intend to behave positively then?
<Kagome:    sa-->
Kagome: Dunno.

2
[Scene change to a view of the sky.]

3
[Long view of a procession of about 12 people walking down what appears to
be a beach beside the sea - it's not entirely clear. At the front is a
person with long black hair carrying a small branch from some kind of bush
or tree. Behind her (presumably a her since the other adults have shaven
hair typical of village men of the time) is four mean carrying a simple
platform on which a small child is sitting. Behind them is a small group of
men. Everyone is in simple white kimono's and it seems to be a rather
solemn procession.]
Fx water: slish... <Za---n>

4
[View of the group from the front. The woman in front seems to be fairly
young - early twenties or something.]

5
[Closeup of the child - she had dark skin, and her hair is textured the same
way as Shippou's, so maybe she has yellowish/silverish hair. She's pretty
young and probably around 5-8 years old. She seems to have white irises.
She seems rather frightened.]



Page 5
1
[A sudden gust buffets the group.]
Fx air: whooosh <Goooo_>

2
[Looming in front of the group is now a huge, old looking bat-Youkai. It has
a humanoid face, but pointed ears and large fags, with long white hair and
is wearing some clothes. It's probably around 10m tall.]
Fx bat-youkai: *massive weight...* <Zun...>
<youkai:    gehehehehe...>
youkai: Gehehehehe...
<youkai:    TSUrete kita ka...>
youkai: You brought her huh...
<villager:    uwa_.>
villager: Uwha!

3
[Closeup of the woman in front. (she's actually the mother of the child, so
I'll just refer to her as 'mother' as we don't get her name)]
<mother:    YAKUSOKU da!>
mother: It's a promise!
<mother:    MUSUME wa HIkiWATAsu!>
mother: I'll hand over my daughter!



Page 6
1
[View of the woman facing the huge Youkai which has bent down. (the
bat-Youkai has white irises like that child by the way...)]
<mother:    sono kawari NIDO to MURA o OSOu na yo!>
mother: In return you don't attack the village again!
Fx bat-youkai: hshht... <Shu---...>
<youkai:    gehehehehe, aa YAKUSOKU da.>
youkai: Gehehehehe, it's a promise.

2
[The mother turns around with a stern look.]
<mother:    saa, SHIORI, SOFU-dono no TOKORO ni Iki na.>
mother: Now then Shiori, go to your sofu-dono's side.

(    "Shiori" approximately translates as "violet cloth" or "violet weave".
"Sofu-dono" would be a respectable way of saying "grandfather". "jii-sama"
is an alternative way of saying "grandfather".)

3
[Closeup of the girl who has a rather hesitant look, but she doesn't seem to
display much emotion in general.]
<Shiori:    uchi, yappari iya da.>
Shiori: I'd rather not go.
<Shiori:    jii-sama kowai yo.>
Shiori: I'm scared of jii-sama.

4
[Having put the platform with Shiori on down, the other villagers talk to her.]
<villager#1:    Itte kure SHIORI.>
villager#1: Please go Shiori.
<villager#2:    MURA no tame da zo.>
villager#2: It's for the village's sake.

5
[Shiori heads towards the huge bat-Youkai turning back to look at the others.]
<Shiori:    kaa-chan...>
Shiori: Kaa-chan...

(    "kaa-chan" would translate as "mom" or something - not as formal as
"sofu-dono" or "jii-sama".)

6
[View of the mother clutching that twig with a sad look.]
<mother:    socchi no HOU ga...>
mother: .oO(This way...).
<mother:    omae wa shiawase ni nareru n-da.>
mother: .oO(you'll be able to be happy.).

[Scene change to an outside view of Toutousai's "house" - a large skull
among burning rocks. Toutousai's large three-eyed bull is standing around
as is Kirara.]
Fx rocks: rumble... <Go--->

2
[Closeup of Toutousai.]
<Toutousai:    donna TSUYOi KEKKAI demo KIru WAZA o OSHIero~?>
Toutousai: Tell you about an attack that can cut through any barrier, no matter how strong?

3
[Inuyasha is sitting down inside Toutousai's place, while Toutousai is
working on a blade.]
<Inuyasha:    TOUTOUSAI ome- nara SHItte n-daro?>
Inuyasha: You'd know about one wouldn't you Toutousai?
<Inuyasha:    OSHIero IMA sugu.>
Inuyasha: Tell me right now.
<Toutousai:    nee yo, sonna TSUGOU no ii WAZA.>
Toutousai: There's no attack that's so convenient.

4
[Side view of Toutousai.]
<Toutousai:    ma, JIMICHI ni SUBUri demo shito-ku n-da na.
                                          "shite oku"
>
Toutousai: Well, you should steadily practice your swings.
<Toutousai:    doo~mo omae wa sekkachi de...>
Toutousai: You really are _so-o_ hasty...

5
[Toutousai looks around to see that nobody's there.]
<Toutousai:    tte, mou inee.>
Toutousai: Oh, he's already gone.



Page 8

[Kirara is flying through the air with Inuyasha on the back.]
Fx air: whoosh <Go--->
<Inuyasha:    yappa sou TSUGOU yoku ikane- ka.>
Inuyasha: .oO(I guess there's nothing so convenient huh.).

2
[Closeup side view of Inuyasha with a slightly annoyed look.]
Fx noise: (from Inuyasha's neck) *su-u-ck* <Ju--->
Inuyasha: ......

3
[Inuyasha slaps his neck.]
Fx Inuyasha: {comically} slap <bachi>
Fx something: *squish* <Buchi>

4
[Inuyasha holds out his hand as Myouga flutters to it.]
Fx Myouga: *flutter* <pira>
<Myouga:    oNATSUkashi ya, INUYASHA-sama.>
Myouga: Long time no see, Inuyasha-sama.
<Inuyasha:    MYOUGA-jijii.>
Inuyasha: Myouga-jijii.

5
[Closeup of Myouga.]
<Myouga:    SAKI hodo no HANASHI subete KIite ori mashita.>
Myouga: I heard all of that conversation earlier.

6
[View of Myouga talking to Inuyasha, who looks surprised.]
<Myouga:    TOUTOUSAI wa aa Itte ori mashita ga,>
Myouga: Toutousai said what he said, but,
<Myouga:    hitotsu HOUOU ga...>
Myouga: there is one way...
<Inuyasha:    nanii!?>
Inuyasha: What!?



Page 9
1
[View of a rocky 'island' (just a big rock really) surrounded by sea, with
some large bats flying around it. There is a swirl of energy around the
rock as well.]
<Myouga:    SAIGOKU ni HYAKKI KOUMORI no ICHIZOKU no SU ga ari mashite na.>
Myouga: {voice over} In the west is the nest of a family of Hyakki Bats.
<Myouga:    sono DOUKUTSU wa TSUYOi KEKKAI de MAMOrarete ite DAREmo TE ga DAsenu.>
Myouga: Their cave is protected by a strong barrier that's beyond everybody.

(    For reference, Inuyasha's father also came from "the west".)

2
[Closeup of Myouga.]
<Myouga:    DAIDAI KEKKAI no MAMOri YAKU ga oru no ja.>
Myouga: There's been a protector of the barrier for generations.

3
[Closeup of Inuyasha.]
<Myouga:    sono MAMOri YAKU no YOUKAI o,>
Myouga: You must slay,
<Myouga:    KIru no desu.>
Myouga: the Youkai who's the protector.

4
[White frame with some splashed blood.]
<Myouga:    sunawachi sore wa TSUYOi KEKKAI o HAru CHIKARA o MOtsu YOUKAI no CHI o,>
Myouga: In other words the blood of the powerful Youkai which raised that strong barrier,
<Myouga:    TETSUSAIGA ni SUwaseru to iu koto.>
Myouga: should be sucked into Tetsusaiga.

5
[View of Inuyasha and Myouga.]
<Myouga:    TSUYOi MONO o KIru koto de, TETSUSAIGA wa TEKI no YOURYOKU o SUitori...>
Myouga: When cutting a strong person, Tetsusaiga sucks up the enemy's Youkai-powers...
<Inuyasha:    TETSUSAIGA ga TSUYOku naru tte koto da na!?>
Inuyasha: Meaning Tetsusaiga becomes stronger!?



Page 10
1
[View of a turbulent see with some large rocks.]
Fx water: slish... <Zaan>

2
[View of several bat-Youkai flying through the air, they seem about the same
size of human and are reasonably humanoid looking - are dressed, have human
looking arms and legs but also have a pair of bat wings coming from their shoulders.]
Fx wings: flap... <Basa>

3
[Two villagers (fishermen) who are on the beach by some boats look up in surprise.]
<villager#1:    na_...>
villager#1: Wha...
<villager#2:    HYAKKI KOUMORI ga...>
villager#2: The Hyakki Bats are...

4
[A bat swoops down grabbing one of the villagers.]
Fx youkai-bat: (man) *grab* <Ga_>
<villager#2:    uwa_.>
villager#2: Uwha!

5
[View of the shore-line.]
Fx sound: {off} crack crack <Baki Baki>



Page 11

[Scene change - view of the sky.]

2
[View of the top a small house.]
<villager:    temee, yokumo damashi yagatta na.>
villager: {off} Bitch, you dare you fucking deceive us.
Fx sound: {off} whack thump <Doka Baki>

3
[A woman (presumably the mother from earlier) crashes to the ground, some
bruises on her face.]
Fx mother: thump <Do_>

4
[A group of angry villagemen surround the woman, several of them carrying harpoons.]
<villager:    omae no MUSUME no SHIORI o WATAseba, MURA wa OSOwarenee hazu datta ja nee no ka, ee!?>
villager: If we handed over your daughter Shiori, the village shouldn't be attacked should it, eeh!?
<villager:    mata NANNIN mo KOROsareta n-da zo.>
villager: Many have been killed again.

5
[The villagers rush forwards weapons raised.]
<villager:    koitsu mo HYAKKI KOUMORI to Guru ni CHIGAinee.>
villager: She's no different from an accomplice of the Hyakki Bats.
<villager:    yacchimae.>
villager: Get her!
Fx villagers: swish <Za_>



Page 12
1
[Closeup of the woman looking off at something in shock.]
Fx sound: {off} whack whack <Doka Doka_>
mother: !?

2
[Inuyasha has beaten back the villagers. Kagome, Miroku and Shippou can be
seen as well.]
<villager:    na_...>
villager: Wh...
<villager:    nanda, omae.>
villager: who're you.
Fx Inuyasha: shh <Za_>
<Inuyasha:    IMA, HYAKKI KOUMORI to Itta na.>
Inuyasha: Just now, you mentioned the Hyakki Bats didn't you.

3
[Closeup of Inuyasha with a slightly nasty smile.]
<Inuyasha:    soitsu-ra no SU no BASHO...>
Inuyasha: Tell me...
<Inuyasha:    OSHIe na.>
Inuyasha: where their nest is.

4
[Kagome and Miroku are seeing to the woman while Sango is behind them
looking off at the others.]
<Kagome:    DAIJOUBU desu ka?>
Kagome: Are you okay?
<Miroku:    YOtte-takatte GOFUJIN ni hidoi koto o.>
Miroku: Ganging up against a woman is cruel.



Page 13
1
[View of the villagers.]
<villager#1:    SU no BASHO nante...>
villager#1: We don't know...
<villager#1:    ore-tachi ga SHIru mon kee.>
villager#1: where the nest is.
<villager#2:    soko no ONNA ni KIki yagare.>
villager#2: Ask that fucking woman.

2
[View of the mother.]
<villager:    nanishiro sono ONNA wa NINGEN no kuse ni,>
villager: {off} At any rate, despite being human, that woman,

3
[Closeup side view of Inuyasha looking slightly shocked.]
<villager:    YOUKAI no... HYAKKI KOUMORI no KO o Unda Abazure nan dakara yo.>
villager: {off} had a child with a Youkai... with a Hyakki Bat, the stuck up bitch.

4
[Kagome and Miroku look at the woman in surprise.]
<Kagome:    YOUKAI no KO o...!?>
Kagome: .oO(A child with a Youkai...).

5
[View of some things inside a small house.]
<mother:    anta-tachi... HYAKKI KOUMORI no SU o SHItte dou suru tsumori nan da?>
mother: {off} What do you people... intend to do if you know where the Hyakki Bats' nest is?

6
[Inside the house the group is sitting around the fire. Kagome has her
medicine box out.]
<Inuyasha:    dou tte...?>
Inuyasha: Do...?
<Inuyasha:    yattsuke ni KIta n-da yo.>
Inuyasha: We can to bust them.
mother: !
<Miroku:    maa MAte INUYASHA.>
Miroku: Wait a bit Inuyasha.



Page 14
1
[Miroku talks to the woman.]
<Miroku:    MUSUMEGO o HYAKKI KOUMORI ni HIkiWATAshita to iu HANASHI da ga,>
Miroku: There was talk of handing your daughter over to the Hyakki Bats,
<Miroku:    sore wa dou iu...?>
Miroku: but what is...?

2
[Drawing of some Hyakki Bats.]
<mother:    HYAKKI KOUMORI wa MUKASHI kara kono HEN ni SUKUtte ite...>
mother: The Hyakki Bats have nested in this area since long ago...
<mother:    NINGEN ya DOUBUTSU o Esa ni shite CHI o SUu OSOroshii YOUKAI nan da.>
mother: They're terrible Youkai which suck the blood from human and animal prey.

3
[Closeup of the mother.]
<mother:    dakedo TSUKUYOMARU-dono wa...>
mother: However, Tsukuyomaru-dono...

(    "Tsukuyo" approximately translates as "moon night", while "maru" is the
same generic end such as in Sesshoumaru.)

4
[Drawing of a bat-Youkai who looks much more like a normal human (bat-Youkai
prince as it were I guess) who has dark skin.]
<mother:    MUSUME no SHIORI no CHICHIOYA, TSUKUYOMARU-dono dake wa CHIGAtte-ta.>
mother: Tsukuyomaru-dono, the father of my daughter Shiori alone was different.
<mother:    NINGEN o KOROsanakatta shi,>
mother: He didn't kill humans,
<mother:    SHIORI ga Umarete kara wa, NAKAMA o SETTOKUshite kureta no ka...>
mother: and after Shiori was born, he persuaded the others...
<mother:    kono MURA dake wa HYAKKI KOUMORI ni OSOwarenakunatta.>
mother: and this village alone wasn't attacked by the Hyakki Bats.

5
[Closeup of Kagome.]
<Kagome:    sore ga doushite...?>
Kagome: Then why...?

6
[Closeup of the mother with a sad look.]
<mother:    TSUKUYOMARU-dono ga SHInda no...>
mother: Tsukuyomaru-dono died...
<mother:    sorede, TOmeru MONO ga inaku natte...>
mother: Afterwards, there was nobody to stop them...

7
[White frame splattered with blood.]
<mother:    mata HYAKKI MOUMORI-tachi ga kono MURA o OSOi HAJImeta.>
mother: and the Hyakki Bats started attacking this village again.



Page 15
1
[Flashback drawing - at night, the huge Youkai-bat from earlier hovers in
front of Shiori and her mother's house.]
<mother:    {voice over} mamonaku TSUKUYOMARU-dono no CHICHI... SHIORI no SOFU ni ataru TAIGOKUMARU ga TSUZUnete kita.>
mother: Shortly after, Tsukuyomaru-dono's father... that is, Shiori's grandfather Taigokumaru, came to visit.
<mother:    SHIORI o HIkiWATAseba MURA ni wa TE o DAsanai to...>
mother: He said that if Shiori was handed over the village wouldn't be touched...

(    "taigoku" approximately translates as "many people in jail", which sounds
rather strange but gives a sense of violence or bloodshed. In the Ansei era
(1858), Ii Naosuke (the prime minister) suppressed over 100 political
opponents. It was called the "Ansei no taigoku".)

2
[Side view of Inuyasha looking a bit surprised.]
<mother:    TAIGOKUMARU ya TSUKUYOMARU-dono wa, DAIDAI HYAKKI KOUMARU no SU no KEKKAI o MAMOru YAKUME o shite ite...>
mother: {off} and that Taigokumaru and Tsukuyomaru-dono had the guardians of the barrier for generations...

3
[Closeup of the mother.]
<mother:    TSUKUYOMARU-dono no CHI o HIku SHIORI ga, ATOME ni HITSUYOU da to iu koto datta.>
mother: and that Shiori who carries Tsukuyomaru-dono's blood, was necessary to succeed in this.

4
[Closeup of Miroku.]
<Miroku:    SHITSUREI nagara... SHIORI-sama wa HANYOU deshou?>
Miroku: Excuse me, but... Shiori-sama is a Half-Youkai isn't she?

5
[View of Inuyasha, Kagome and the mother.]
<Inuyasha:    HANYOU no Gaki ni sonna CHIKARA ga an no ka yo.>
Inuyasha: Does a Half-Youkai kid have that much power?
mother: ......



Page 16
1
[Closeup of the mother.]
<mother:    MIta tokoro anta mo HANYOU da ne?>
mother: Now that I look at you, you're Half-Youkai too aren't you?
<mother:    dattara wakatte-ru n-ja nai no?>
mother: So you understand don't you?

2
[Closeup of Inuyasha with a passive look.]
<mother:    HANYOU dakara tte, YOUKAI ni OTOtte-ru wake ja nai shi,>
mother: Just because you're Half-Youkai it doesn't mean you're inferior to Youkai,
<mother:    NINGEN ni OTOtte-ru wake ja nai tte koto...>
mother: and it doesn't mean you're inferior to humans...

3
[Closeup of Kagome who's clasping her hands and looks kinda happy for some reason.]
<Kagome:    okaa-san...>
Kagome: .oO(Okaa-san...).

(    I guess it seems rather strange that Kagome just says "okaa-san"
("mother"). She's saying "okaa-san" because she doesn't her the persons
name, in which case she'd just say "[name]-san". I guess she's
saying this in the first place because the mother understands what it is
(and isn't) to be Half-Youkai.)

4
[Myouga appears on Inuyasha's shoulder.]
<Myouga:    dou desu ka INUYASHA.>
Myouga: How about it Inuyasha.
<Inuyasha:    sa- na.>
Inuyasha: Dunno.

5
[Closeup side view of the mother.]
<mother:    SHIORI wa YAKUME o HAtaseru dake no CHIKARA o chanto MOtte-ta.>
mother: Shiori just has the power for her to be able to fulfill the succession.
<mother:    dakara,>
mother: That's why,

6
[Closeup of the mother with a sad, angry look.]
<mother:    achira de KUrashita HOU ga ano KO no tame da to...>
mother: I thought it would be better for her to live with them...
<mother:    sorede MURA ga TASUkaru nara to OMOtte...>
mother: and that the village would be saved...
<mother:    sore na no ni HYAKKI KOUMORI-tachi wa YAKUSOKU o YABUtta.>
mother: but the Hyakki Bats broke their promise.



Page 17

[Scene change to a view of a cave entrance in the side of a large rock in
the sea. There's several large bats above the rock.]
Fx water: slish... <Za---n...>

2
[Inuyasha and the mother are standing on some rocks by the shore looking
towards the cave entrance where is close by. There is a light in the dark
of the cave and wisps of energy are coming out the entrance.]
Fx wind: whoosh <Go--->
<mother:    ano DOUKUTSU...>
mother: That cave...
<mother:    HIKAtte-ru tokoro...>
mother: where it's glowing...



Page 18

[Closeup of the place where it's glowing. Inside a small circle Shiori is
sitting, holding what appears to be a black ball.]
Fx wind: whoosh <Go--->
<Shiori:    a...>
Shiori: Ah...

2
[Closeup of Shiori, smiling.]
<Shiori:    kaa-chan....>
Shiori: Kaa-chan...

3
[View of Inuyasha and the mother.]
<mother:    SHIORI...>
mother: Shiori...
Inuyasha: ......

4
[Closeup of Inuyasha looking a bit nervously at Myouga.]
<Inuyasha:    MYOUGA-jijii...>
Inuyasha: Myouga-jijii...
<Inuyasha:    TETSUSAIGA o TSUYOku suru HOUHOU tte TASHIka...>
Inuyasha: The way to make Tetsusaiga stronger is to...
<Myouga:    haa...>
Myouga: Yes...
<Myouga:    ano MUSUME o KIru to iu koto de...>
Myouga: It means to slay that girl...
