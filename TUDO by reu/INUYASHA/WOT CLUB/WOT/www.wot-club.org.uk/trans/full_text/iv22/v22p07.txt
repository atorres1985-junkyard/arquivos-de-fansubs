Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

<Inuyasha:    IMA nara SHIORI o KIZUtsukezu ni...>
Inuyasha: I can do it now without hurting Shiori...

(    "jijii" here is the same as in Myouga-jijii, in that it simply means "old
man", though not polite way of saying it...)
