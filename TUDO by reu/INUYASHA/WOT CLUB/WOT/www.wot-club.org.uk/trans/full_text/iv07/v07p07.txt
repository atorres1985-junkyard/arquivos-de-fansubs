Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

<Inuyasha:    NARAKU o SAGAshite bu_KOROsu.>
Inuyasha: Find Naraku and waste him.

[Closeup of Miroku thinking.]

[Miroku turns to look back at Shippou, who is faced away from him, looking
at the Well.]
<Miroku:    SHIPPOU...>
Miroku: Shippou...
<Shippou:    SHIran.>
Shippou: I don't know you.

one hand.]

looks off to the side.]
<Inuyasha:    wakatteru nara DAMAttero!>
Inuyasha: If you understand, shut up!
<Miroku:    ... ni shitemo MYOU desu na.>
Miroku: ... By the way, it's a bit strange, isn't it.

<Miroku:    INUYASHA omae,>
Miroku: Inuyasha,
<Miroku:    GOJUU NEN MAE ni kono MURA de, NARAKU no WANA ni kakerareta to iu koto desu ga...>
Miroku: I know that 50 years ago you were caught in Naraku's trap in the village, but...
<Inuyasha:    aa.>
Inuyasha: Yeah.

(    Inuyasha's 'Yeah' is to agree that the situation Miroku described is correct.)

3
[Closeup of Miroku looking a little serious.]
<Miroku:    tsumari omae wa,>
Miroku: In other words,
<Miroku:    NARAKU ni Atta koto ga aru no desu.>

Inuyasha: Though you're saying I met him...
<Inuyasha:    KIKYOU ni BAketa SUGATA de da.>
Inuyasha: he'd changed into Kikyou.
<Inuyasha:    SHOUTAI wa wakaranee.>
Inuyasha: I don't know his real appearance.

4
[Miroku speaks some more.]
<Miroku:    sore ga MYOU da to Itteru n-desu.>
Miroku: That is what I said is strange.
<Miroku:    omae wa NARAKU o SHIranai.>
Miroku: You don't know Naraku.
<Miroku:    naze URAmarete iru no ka mo...>
Miroku: [You don't know] the reason why he feels bitter towards you, either...

<Miroku:    KAKAwatte ita no kamo shiremasen na.>
Miroku: some connection perhaps.

school clothes.]
<Kagome:    a...>

break' look.]

short-hair: You're cursed of the rheumatism!?
<long-hair:    ara KAKKE yo ne-.>

<long-hair:    dou shita no yo.>

Fx desk: (as Kagome stands up) clatter <Gatata>
<Kagome:    dattara YURUsena-i!>
Kagome: In that case, I can't forgive him!

beside her.]
<teacher:    HIGURASHI.>
teacher: Higurashi.
<teacher:    ROUKA de TAttore.>
teacher: Stand in the hall.

(    Higurashi is Kagome's family name.)

[Inside Kaede's house, Inuyasha is sitting bare-chested while Kaede rubs
some stuff from a small jar onto his back.]
<Kaede:    INUYASHA,>
Kaede: Inuyasha,
<Kaede:    kono KIZU de wa TATAKAi wa shibaraku MURI da.>
Kaede: with a wound like this, fighting will be impossible for a little while.
<Inuyasha:    urusee  NI, SAN NICHI de fusagaru.>
Inuyasha: Shuttup. In two to three days, it'll have closed up.

3
[Inuyasha looks back over his shoulder.]
<Inuyasha:    sore yori KAEDE-babaa,>
Inuyasha: Besides that, Kaede-babaa,
<Inuyasha:    nanka NARAKU ni tsuite OMOi ataru koto nee no ka yo_.>
Inuyasha: you recall something about Naraku don't you!

4
[Closeup of Kaede.]
<Kaede:    washi to te...>
Kaede: I have also been...
<Kaede:    zutto KANGAete ita sa.>
Kaede: thinking about it all the time.

5
[Drawing of Kikyou.]
<Kaede:    ano TOKI...>
Kaede: {voice over} Ever since that time...
<Kaede:    KIKYOU-onee-sama ga HONE to TSUCHI de YOMIGAEtte IRAI, zutto na.>
Kaede: when Kikyou-onee-sama was resurrected with bones and earth.

[FlashBack Closeup of Kikyou looking quite angry, while behind her is a drawing of when 'Inuyasha' clawed Kikyou and took the Jewel
<Kikyou:    INUYASHA omae wa...>
Kikyou: Inuyasha, you...
<Kikyou:    WATASHI o sono TSUME de HIkiSAki SHIKON no TAMA o UBAtta.>
Kikyou: were the one whose claws tore me up, and snatched away the Shikon no Tama.
EndFlashBack]

[Kaede continues to speak.]
<Kaede:    INUYASHA no SUGATA o KArita soyatsu wa,>
Kaede: The guy who borrowed Inuyasha's shape,
<Kaede:    sonno mama TAMA o MOtte NIgetemo yokatta no da.>
Kaede: could have run off with the Jewel after that.
<Kaede:    sore na no ni...>
Kaede: However...

4
[FlashBack Inuyasha attacks the village, burning it, and has the Jewel in his hand
<Kaede:    INUYASHA, omae ni MURA o OSOwase,>
Kaede: {voice over} Inuyasha, he [trickily] made you attack the village,
<Kaede:    SHIKON no TAMA o tsukamaseru you ni SHIMUketa.>
Kaede: so that you could get hold of the Shikon no Tama.

5
[Kikyou pins Inuyasha to the tree with the arrow.]
<Kaede:    soshite, KIKYOU-onee-sama no TE de omae o KOROsaseta.>
Kaede: {voice over} And then, he arranged it so that you should be killed by Kikyou-onee-sama's attack.
EndFlashBack]

[Closeup side view of Kaede thinking.]
<Kaede:    omae-tachi o NIKUshimi awase takatta no ka...>
Kaede: Someone wanted both of you joined together in hatred, perhaps...
<Kaede:    arui wa...>
Kaede: Either that or...

2
[Inuyasha looks somewhat surprised.]
<Kaede:    KIKYOU-onee-sama no KOKORO o...>
Kaede: {off} he wanted to make Kikyou-onee-sama's heart...
<Kaede:    URAmi ya NIKUshimi de KEGAshi takatta no ka.>
Kaede: soiled with malice and hatred perhaps.
<Inuyasha:    na_...?>
Inuyasha: Wha...?

3
[Kikyou holds the glowing Shikon no Tama in her hands.]
<Kaede:    SHIKON no TAMA wa, KIKYOU-onee-sama ga MOtsu koto de,>
Kaede: {voice over} The Shikon no Tama, by being in Kikyou-onee-sama's possession,
<Kaede:    JOUKAsarete ita.>
Kaede: was purified.

4
[White frame showing the Shikon no Tama with some blood splattered over it.]
<Kaede:    sono onee-sama no KOKORO ga YOGOreru to iu koto wa,>
Kaede: {voice over} It means that, if onee-sama's heart was soiled,
<Kaede:    TAMA ga YOGOre, JAAKU na CHIKARA ga MAsu to iu koto...>
Kaede: then it would soil the Jewel, and it's evil power would increase...

5
[Inuyasha and Miroku look somewhat surprised.]
<Kaede:    sono KORO, sore o NOZOnde ita MONO ga,>
Kaede: At that time, there was one, and only one person,
<Kaede:    tada HITORI ita no da.>
Kaede: who wished that would happen.
Inuyasha: !

6
[Closeup of Kaede.]
<Kaede:    Itte miru ka...>
Kaede: Shall we go and see...?
<Kaede:    soyatsu ga Ita TOKORO ni...>
Kaede: To the place were that guy was...



Page 14

[Kaede, Inuyasha and Miroku are now outside, walking through some thick,
tall grass.]
Fx grass: rustle <Za_>
<Kaede:    soyatsu wa ONIGUMO to NANOru YATOU de na...>
Kaede: That guy was a wild-thief who gave his name as 'Onigumo'...
<Inuyasha:    YATOU da to!?>
Inuyasha: Wild thief!?

2
[Closeup of Kaede walking through the tall grass.]
<Kaede:    RINGOKU de sanzan AKUJI o hataraite, NOGArete kita no o...>
Kaede: In a neighbouring country he had committed all sorts of crimes, and came running here...

3
[View of Inuyasha, looking over at Kaede.]
<Kaede:    KIKYOU-onee-sama ga kakumatte ita no da.>
Kaede: {off} and Kikyou-onee-sama gave him shelter.
<Inuyasha:    KIKYOU ga doushite.>
Inuyasha: Why did Kikyou do that.

4
[Inuyasha is surprised as Kaede makes a point.]
<Kaede:    soyatsu...>
Kaede: {off} Because that guy...
<Kaede:    ONIGUMO wa mattaku UGOkenakatta kara da.
'mattaku ugokenakatta' is emphasised
>
Kaede: Onigumo, _could not move at all_.
Inuyasha: !?

5
[Kaede and the other two arrive at a large rock formation near a lake. There
seems to be a dark crevice in the side of the rock formation.]
Fx lake: shlish... <Za...>
<Kaede:    koko da...>
Kaede: This is it...



Page 15

[Closeup of the dark crevice in the rock formation.]
<Kaede:    kono DOUKUTSU no NAKA de na...>
Kaede: {off} It's inside this cave...

2
[FlashBack a man wrapped up in bandages lies on a straw mat, and there is a blanket over him. His face seems badly burnt and only one eye is visible
<Kaede:    ZENSHIN hidoi YAKEDO o otte,>
Kaede: {voice over} His whole body was covered in terrible burns,
<Kaede:    KAO wa TOKU ni hidoku YAke-tadarete ita shi...>
Kaede: and in particular his face was terribly burnt...
<Kaede:    Gake kara Ochita no darou...>
Kaede: Maybe he fell down a cliff...
<Kaede:    RYOUASHI no HONE wa KUDAkete ita.>
Kaede: as the bones in both legs were broken.

3
[Kikyou sits by Onigumo in the cave.]
<Kaede:    sore demo ONIGUMO wa Ikiteita.>
Kaede: But even then, Onigumo stayed alive.
<Kaede:    UGOke wa shinakatta ga... KAYU o susuri, HANASHI o suru hodo ni KAIFUKU shita.>
Kaede: He couldn't move, but... he recovered well enough that he could sip gruel and talk.

<Onigumo:    omae no ANEKI...>
Onigumo: Your aneki...
<Onigumo:    SHIKON no TAMA tte yatsu o... MOtteru n-daro.>
Onigumo: The thing called the Shikon no Tama... is in her possession, isn't it.

(    'Aneki' is a rather rough/colloquial way of saying 'elder sister'.)

4
[Closeup of Kaede.]
<Kaede:    TAMA no koto...>
Kaede: How do you...
<Kaede:    nande SHItteru!?>
Kaede: know about the Jewel!?

5
[Kaede looks at Onigumo lying on the mat.]
<Onigumo:    AKUTOU wa minna...>
Onigumo: Because all the villains...
<Onigumo:    NERAtteru kara na.>
Onigumo: are after it you see.
<Kaede:    omae mo?>
Kaede: You too?

6
[Closeup of Onigumo's eye.]
<Onigumo:    TAMA wa... URAmi no CHI o SUu hodo ni,>
Onigumo: The Jewel... becomes more evil,
<Onigumo:    WARUku naru n-datte naa,>
Onigumo: as it sucks [more] malicious blood, doesn't it.
<Onigumo:    ii naa.>
Onigumo: Nice.

7
[Closeup side view of Kaede looking away with her eyes closed.]
<Kaede:    onee-sama ga KIYOmete iru.>
Kaede: Onee-sama keeps it pure.
<Kaede:    WARUku wa naranai.>
Kaede: It won't become evil.

8
[Kaede looks back, annoyed, at Onigumo.]
<Onigumo:    KIKYOU wa itsumo sumashita KAO shite yagaru mon naa.>
Onigumo: {off} Kikyou always has a fucking unruffled face, doesn't she.

[View of Onigumo lying on the mat.]
<Onigumo:    MIte mitee naa.>
Onigumo: I wanna see it...
<Onigumo:    ano ONNA no MIDAreta KAO...>

<Kaede:    onee-sama,>

Kaede: I, hate that guy.
<Kikyou:    sou... ONIGUMO ga sonna koto o...>
Kikyou: I see... Onigumo said such a thing...

[Closeup of Kikyou turning around to look at Kaede.]
<Kikyou:    demo, YURUshite oage.>
Kikyou: But, forgive him.
<Kikyou:    ano OTOKO wa osoraku ISSHOU...>
Kikyou: Because perhaps that man will be...
<Kikyou:    asoko kara UGOkenai no dakara.>
Kikyou: be unable to move from there for his whole life.
EndFlashBack]

3
[FlashBack Kikyou's body is cremated
<Kaede:    sore kara MAmonaku da...>
Kaede: Soon after that...
<Kaede:    onee-sama ga INUYASHA o KOROshi, JIBUN o SHInda no wa.>
Kaede: onee-sama killed Inuyasha, and died herself.

4
[Little Kaede, this time with a bandage across her face, looks into the
mouth of the cave.]
<Kaede:    soshite SUUJITSUGO washi ga OTOZUreta TOKI,>
Kaede: {voice over} Then when I visited several days later,
<Kaede:    DOUKETSU wa YAkeOchite ita.>
Kaede: the cave was burnt out.

5
[View of Onigumo lying on the mat, with flames all around him.]
<Kaede:    Akari no HI ga MOeta no darou to...>
Kaede: I wonder if to lamp's flame burnt it...
<Kaede:    ONIGUMO wa NIgeru koto ga dekizu...>

[Inuyasha turns to Kaede.]
<Kaede:    HONE mo NOKOsazu YAkeSHInda no darou to OMOtte ita.>

<Inuyasha:    ore ga SAGAshiteru NARAKU wa YOUKAI da zo.>
Inuyasha: Naraku, the guy I'm after, is a Youkai.

2
[View of Kaede.]
<Kaede:    TASHIka ni na...>
Kaede: Quite probably...
<Kaede:    dorehodo ni JAAKU demo yatsu wa NINGEN datta.>
Kaede: However evil he was, that guy was human.
<Kaede:    sore dake wa MACHIGAi nai ga...>
Kaede: There is no mistake about it, but...

[Miroku looks off at the cave, while the other two look at him.]
