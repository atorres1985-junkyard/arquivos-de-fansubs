Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

5
[Closeup side view of Kagome making a point, while behind her is a flashback
to Sesshoumaru getting zapped by Tetsusaiga when he was trying to pull it
out of the pedestal.]

<Kagome:    FUreru koto sura dekinakatta no ni...>

Inuyasha: This time, you'll get more than just your arm lopped off!

3
[Inuyasha makes a massive swing downwards, just missing Sesshoumaru, who
dodges slightly to the side, while the ground gets blown up.]
Fx Tetsusaiga: (moving though air) whoosh <Go_>
Fx ground: wham <Doga>

Sesshoumaru: Your sword form is completely open...
<Sesshoumaru:    OOki na KATANA ni FUriMAWAsare otte...>
Sesshoumaru: The sword is throwing you around...

(    Sesshoumaru means that Inuyasha's sword movement can easily be predicted,
making it easy to dodge and counterattack. Also, he says that because of
Tetsusaiga's large weight, Inuyasha can't wield it well and he's getting
swung around bt the weight. It hasn't been stated directly before, by the
sound fx have indicated that Tetsusaiga (in powered up form) weights a lot.)
