Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

an arrow drawn on her bow, Shippou who has faint transformation mists
around him, and Miroku who is removing the rosary beads from his right hand.]

Title: The Saimyoushou

(    The title of this chapter literally means 'Ultra-Fierce Fighting', but is
actually a name.)

[Sesshoumaru stands holding Tetsusaiga in his left hand, pointing it at Inuyasha.]
Fx atmosphere: oohhmmm... <Goooo...>
<Sesshoumaru:    INUYASHA yo,>
Sesshoumaru: Inuyasha,
<Sesshoumaru:    TETSUSAIGA no Sebi ni nare...>
Sesshoumaru: become blood rusting on Tetsusaiga's blade...

(    Sesshoumaru is using a cliche phrase, which Inuyasha actually said to
Sesshoumaru back when Inuyasha attacked Sesshoumaru with Tetsusaiga for the
first time. Anyway, it's a theat to one's opponent, declearing that the
opponent's body will become the rust of the speaker's katana - after
they've been cut up by the blade of course.)

<Jaken:    washi made KOROsareru tokoro datta zo.>
Jaken: I would have been killed along with them.

(    Jaken means that because Inuyasha disturbed Sesshoumaru's concentration, he
didn't execute the attack properly (meaning it had less power), and if not
for that Jaken would have been killed too.)

Fx scene: oohhmm... <Goooo...>
Fx Tetsusaiga and scabbard: *strain against each other...* <Gugu...>
