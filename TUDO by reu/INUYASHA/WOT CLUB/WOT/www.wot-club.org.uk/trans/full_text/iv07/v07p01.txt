Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

[Kagome, with a smile, and Inuyasha, looking at Kagome without much
expression, are sitting almost back to back outside. In front of them is
Shippou, looking bored, and behind them is Miroku, who's looking at his arm.]

[View of some clouds in the sky.]

2
[A bunch of bandits (at least 10) are riding along on horses through the countryside.]
Fx horses: (hoves) *rumble rumble <Do Do Do Do>
<bandit:    ISOgou oKASHIRA,>
bandit: Let's hurry, Chief,
<bandit:    kono HEN na HI ga KUreru to YOUKAI ga DEru to iu zo.>
bandit: I've heard that Youkai come out in this area after dark.
<chief:    YOUKAI daa?>
chief: Youkai? Hah!

3
[A scarred bandit notices something ahead.]
<bandit:    n?>
bandit: Hn?

4
[Up ahead is a richly dressed figure with long white hair, looking away from
the approaching bandits. Looks like Sesshoumaru.]

5
[View of two bandits running along.]
<bandit:    yo, YOUKAI!?>
bandit: A, a Youkai!?
<bandit:    baka ka temee, arya NINGEN da.>
bandit: Stupid bastard, that's a human.

[The bandits move to attack.]
Fx horses: (hoves) *rumble rumble <Do Do Do Do>
<bandit-1:    omoshiree YOROI KIteru zo.>
bandit-1: Interesting armour he's wearin'.
<bandit-2:    bu_KOROshite MIgurumi        haijimae.
                           all possessions haide shimae 
>
bandit-2: We'll kill 'im, and take all he has.

2
[Closer view from the bandits perspective of the figure ahead, turning
around slightly - it _is_ Sesshoumaru.]

3
[Sesshoumaru takes out his left arm, which is dark, deformed, ugly, and a
bit too big.]
Fx Sesshoumaru: (aura) ooohhmmm... <Zawa...>
Fx arm: *snap snap* <Baki Baki>



Page 4-5
1
[Sesshoumaru charges through the bandits snapping off all their arms with
his hand, and blood goes flying everywhere.]
Fx Sesshoumaru: (rushing through bandits) *smoothly... <Fuwa...>
Fx bandits: (heads being cut off) *snap* *snap* *snap* <Baki Baki Baki>
Fx decapitated bandit: (blood coming from neck) *gush-h-h-h-h* <Shu---->

2
[Sesshoumaru lands on a rocky outcropping, while behind him all the bandits'
bodies fall over, bleeding.]
Fx Sesshoumaru: (landing) tmp... <Ton...>
Fx bandits: splush <Dosha>

[Jaken, Sesshoumaru's retainer, comes out of some grass.]
Fx grass: rustle <Gasa>
<Jaken:    yo_, oMIGOTO de gozaimasu.>
Jaken: Greetings, great work there.
<Jaken:    sasuga SESSHOUMARU-sama.>
Jaken: You're so great, Sesshoumaru-sama.
Fx Jaken: (hitting himself on head) whack <pishi_>

(    Jaken hitting himself on the head is sort of a sign of happyness (and also
flattery) - I remember Ranma doing this once when beating up his father.)

2
[Sesshoumaru stands with his normal, right hand gripping his deformed left
one, which is covered in blood.]
<Sesshoumaru:    JAKEN ka...>
Sesshoumaru: Jaken, huh...

3
[Closeup of Jaken.]
<Jaken:    yahari AOONI o KOROshite mogitotta UDE dake atte,>
Jaken: As expected, the arm you tore off from that Blue Oni you killed,
<Jaken:    TSUYOu gozaimasu na-.>
Jaken: is certainly strong, m'lord.
Fx Jaken: heh <tehe_>

(    There are typically two types of Oni that appear in folklore tales, and
often in pairs - Aka-Oni, and Ao-Oni - red and blue. There doesn't seem to
be any special meaning behind Jaken refering to a Blue Oni, instead of just Oni.)

4
[A foot of Sesshoumaru's kicks Jaken in the face.]
Fx foot: whump <Doka>
<Jaken:    a"u"_!>
Jaken: _Oww!!_

5
[Sesshoumaru looks at his arm, which seems to have partially absorbed the
blood, and seems to be shrinking a bit.]
<Sesshoumaru:    kisama no ME wa FUSHIANA ka.>
Sesshoumaru: Are your eyes useless holes, arsehole?
<Sesshoumaru:    kore wa mou TSUKAi MONO ni naran.>
Sesshoumaru: This still isn't of any use.



Page 7

[Sesshoumaru walks away from Jaken, who looks slightly worried.]
<Jaken:    arara, mata DAME deshita ka.>
Jaken: Oh dear, it's still no good, huh.
<Sesshoumaru:    motto mashi na UDE o MOtsu YOUKAI o SAGAshite koi.>
Sesshoumaru: Go and look for a Youkai with an even stronger arm.
<Sesshoumaru:    samonai to KOROsu zo.>
Sesshoumaru: Otherwise I'll kill you.

2
[Closeup of Jaken, looking slightly worried.]
Fx Jaken: (heart) *thump thump* <doki doki>
<Jaken:    haa~>
Jaken: .oO(Si~igh.).
<Jaken:    mou TSUKAreta konna SEIKATSU.>
Jaken: .oO(I'm getting really tired of living like this.).

3
[A flashback to when Inuyasha rips into Sesshoumaru's arm with Tetsusaiga.]
<Jaken:    kore mo INUYASHA me ga, SESSHOUMARU-sama no UDE o KIriOtoshita sei ja.>
Jaken: .oO({voice over} That damn Inuyasha, this is his fault for lopping off Sesshoumaru-sama's arm.).

4
[Sesshoumaru and Jaken turn at a voice.]
<voice:    oKOMAri no you de gozaimasu na.>
voice: You seem to be in a bit of a fix, don't you.

(    This speaker is being _very_ polite - as servile as Jaken is.)

[On the edge of a forest is what appears to be yeti-like Youkai, though it's
actually wearing a baboon-pelt.]
<youkai:    INUYASHA me no ANI...>
youkai: Elder brother of that accursed Inuyasha...
<youkai:    SESSHOUMARU-sama de gozaimashou?>
youkai: Sesshoumaru-sama, are you not?
Sesshoumaru: ............
<Jaken:    hi_.>
Jaken: Eep!

2
[Sesshoumaru looks on, almost bored.]
<Sesshoumaru:    ... nanda kisama?>
Sesshoumaru: ... What do you want, arsehole?

3
[A closeup side view of the yeti shows that it appears to be a costume, and
there's some white (possibly human) figure beneath it.]
<youkai:    anata-sama DOUYOU, INUYASHA o NIKUmu MONO...>
youkai: Like yourself, a person who hates Inuyasha...



Page 9
1
[The newcomer holds up a human looking forearm.]
<youkai:    kono UDE,>
youkai: This arm,
<youkai:    oTSUKAi kudasare.>
youkai: please make use of it.

2
[Sesshoumaru looks vaguely interested, but Jaken is angry.]
Sesshoumaru: ............
<Jaken:    n~!?>
Jaken: Hn~n!?
<Jaken:    fuzakeru na kisama.>
Jaken: Cut the jokes, arsehole.

3
[View of being holding the arm.]
<Jaken:    sore wa NINGEN no UDE dewai nai ka_.>
Jaken: {off} Isn't that a human arm!?
<youkai:    ikanimo...>
youkai: But of course...

4
[Jaken and the newcomer discuss things while a Shikon fragment is shown in
the background.]
<youkai:    kore wa NINGEN no UDE ni, SHIKON no kakera o SHIKOnda mono.>
youkai: This human arm, has a Shikon fragment embedded in it.
<Jaken:    SHIKON no kakera o?>
Jaken: With a Shikon fragment?

(    I wonder if this arm was the one belonging to the artist Koutatsu.)

5
[Sesshoumaru looks interested.]
<youkai:    NINGEN no UDE o MORAireba...>
youkai: {off} If you use a human arm...
<youkai:    INUYASHA no MOtsu YOUTOU TETSUSAIGA o tsukamu koto mo deki mashou.>
youkai: you'll even be able to use the devil-blade Tetsusaiga that Inuyasha carries.
Sesshoumaru: !



Page 10
1
[Side view of the newcomer talking, while Tetsusaiga is shown in the background.]
<youkai:    TETSUSAIGA wa NINGEN o MAMOru KATANA to KIkiOYObi masu.>
youkai: I have heard about Tetsusaiga, the "sword that protects humans".
<youkai:    honrai, anata-sama no you na KANPEKI na YOUKAI ni wa ATSUKAenu KATANA da to...>
youkai: Originally, it's a sword that a perfect Youkai like you wouldn't be able to handle...

2
[Closeup side view of Sesshoumaru smiling slightly.]
<Sesshoumaru:    fu_, kisama.>
Sesshoumaru: Humph, hey arsehole.
<Sesshoumaru:    INUYASHA ga NIKUi to nukashiotta na.>
Sesshoumaru: You said that you hate Inuyasha, didn't you.

3
[Sesshoumaru looks down at the person in front of him, who looks down.]
<Sesshoumaru:    INUYASHA o KOROsu tame ni,>
Sesshoumaru: For the sake of killing Inuyasha,
<Sesshoumaru:    kono WATASHI o TSUKAou to iu no ka.>
Sesshoumaru: you're saying you'll make use of me?
<youkai:    GYOI.>
youkai: Quite correct.
<Jaken:    ki_ kisama, nanto OSOreOOI...>
Jaken: Yo, you arsehole, you've got damn nerve [to say that to Sesshoumaru-sama]...

4
[Sesshoumaru takes the arm with a smile, to Jaken's surprise.]
<Sesshoumaru:    omoshiroi,>
Sesshoumaru: Interesting,
<Sesshoumaru:    sono UDE moratte yarou.>
Sesshoumaru: I'll take that arm and use it.
<Jaken:    se_, SESSHOUMARU-sama_.>
Jaken: Se, Sesshoumaru-sama!

5
[Closeup of the person, who seems to be wearing a kimono beneath the fur.]
<youkai:    sore to mou hitotsu....>
youkai: There is another thing...



Page 11
1
[Closeup of the person holding out some round, uneven dark object in its hand.]
<youkai:    kono SU o...>
youkai: [Please take] this nest...
<youkai:    KANARAzu YAKU ni tatsu hazu de gozaimasu.>
youkai: It should definitely be helpful.

2
[Closeup of Sesshoumaru.]
<Sesshoumaru:    kisama no NA o KIite okou ka.>
Sesshoumaru: Would you give me your name, arsehole.

3
[Closeup side view of the person, smiling slightly.]
<Naraku:    NARAKU...>
Naraku: Naraku...
<Naraku:    ... to MOUshi masu.>
Naraku: ... is how I'm called.

4
[Closeup of Sesshoumaru holding the nest, smiling slightly.]
<Sesshoumaru:    NARAKU ka.>
Sesshoumaru: Naraku, huh.
<Sesshoumaru:    OBOete okou.>
Sesshoumaru: I'll remember this.



Page 12
1
[View of a small port by the sea, which has a Shinto Shrine.]
Fx sea: slish... <Za...>

2
[View of some rich looking dwelling.]

3
[Kagome is happily eating something out of a bowl with chopsticks.]
<Kagome:    yokatta- NOJUKU ja nakute.>
Kagome: This is great! We aren't staying outside again.

4
[Kagome is in a room, looking at Inuyasha who's looking at her while sitting
with his back against a wall. Near Kagome, Shippou is eating some food too.]
<Inuyasha:    ke_ WARUkatta na,>
Inuyasha: Bah! Oh, I'm _so_ sorry,
<Inuyasha:    itsumo wa NOJUKU bakkari de.>
Inuyasha: that it was always only outside.
<Kagome:    INUYASHA anta...>
Kagome: Inuyasha, you...
<Kagome:    SAIKIN, higamippokunai?>
Kagome: you get some persecution complex recently?



Page 13
1
[Closeup of Miroku putting up an 'Ofuda' (talisman of warding).]
Fx Miroku: *paste* <Peta>
<Miroku:    kore de yoroshii.>
Miroku: This'll do fine.

2
[Miroku is walking alongside an old man (probably a servant) on the walkway
next to the mansion.]
Fx Miroku: *walking on wood* <tota tota>
<Miroku:    kore nite kono YASHIKI no YOUKUU ni aru FUKITSU na KUMO wa, HARAware mashou.>
Miroku: With this, the evil-omened clouds that float above this mansion will be cleared.
<old man:    arigarou gozaimasu HOUSHI-sama.>
old man: Thanks awfully, houshi-sama.

3
[Miroku walks into the room Kagome and Inuyasha are.]
<Kagome:    oHARAi goKUROU sama-.>
Kagome: Thanks for putting them up.
<Miroku:    sate,>
Miroku: Now then,
<Miroku:    yukkuri YASUmi mashou ka.>
Miroku: shall we take a good rest?

4
[Closeup of Inuyasha.]
<Inuyasha:    ou MIROKU,>
Inuyasha: Hey Miroku,
<Inuyasha:    ore ni wa doo-mo NATTOKU dekinee n-daga...>
Inuyasha: It somehow doesn't seem reasonable to me...

5
[Closeup of Miroku.]
<Miroku:    hai?>
Miroku: Yes?



Page 14
1
[Inuyasha comes to glare are Miroku.]
<Inuyasha:    NEgura o SAGAsu KOKUGEN ni naru to KANARAzu,
              nest     look for time
>
Inuyasha: When it's time to look for a place to sleep,
<Inuyasha:    ATAri de ICHIBAN RIPPA na YASHIKI no JOUKUU ni, FUKITSU no KUMO ga tarekometeru no wa do-yu wake dei.>
Inuyasha: [why are we always] going to the best looking mansion in the area, which always have evil-omened clouds above it?
<Miroku:    haa?>
Miroku: Huh?

2
[Closeup of Miroku looking a bit surprised.]
<Miroku:    nani o IMA sara.>
Miroku: What's this at such a late hour.
<Miroku:    Uso mo HOUBEN to iu dewa arimasen ka.>
Miroku: Haven't you heard that "lies are convenient"?

(    Miroku is using this proveb to justify his lie, and also indicates that he
might to such things regularly. The implication is that Miroku has been
doing this a lot recently, which is probably why Inuyasha, who prefers to
stay outside, has been a bit grumpy recently.)

3
[Closeup of Inuyasha looking surprised.]
<Inuyasha:    e".>
Inuyasha: _Eh_.

4
[Shippou turns to Kagome, who looks a bit embarrassed.]
<Shippou:    Uso jatta no ka!?>
Shippou: It was just a lie!?
<Kagome:    WATASHI wa usuusu KANzuiteta kedo...>
Kagome: .oO(I had a slight suspicion, but...).

5
[Inuyasha continues to look at Miroku in surprise, while Kagome looks at the pair.]
<Inuyasha:    na, nate WARUi yatsu nanda.>
Inuyasha: Yo, you're such a wicked guy.
<Miroku:    omae no ATAMA ga KATAi no desu.>
Miroku: You're so obstinate.
<Kagome:    docchi o Foro- shite ii n-da ka...>
Kagome: Which of them should I side with...?

(    The implication is that Kagome is thinking about joining in the discussion,
and also that she more or less agrees with both sides.)

6
[Kagome suddenly feels something.]
Fx Kagome: *shiver* <Zoku_>
Kagome: !



Page 15
1
[Kagome stands up.]
Fx Kagome: swish <Za_>
<Kagome:    SHIKON no kakera no KEHAI ga...>
Kagome: I sense a Shikon fragment, but...

2
[Miroku and Inuyasha are suddenly a lot more serious.]
<Inuyasha:    nani!?>
Inuyasha: What!?

3
[Closeup of Kagome looking worried.]
<Kagome:    monosugoi HAYAsa de CHIKAzuite kuru...>
Kagome: The speed it's approaching at is incredible...
<Kagome:    sore ni kono JAKI...>
Kagome: Also, this evil feeling...

4
[Kagome and Inuyasha look off at the sound of a noise.]
Fx sound: ta-dump... <Zuuun...>
Kagome: !

(    This sound fx is being used to indicate something massive walking. Imagine
a sound like what the Staypuff Marshmellow-man makes when walking in the
film, Ghostbusters.)

5
[Inuyasha and Kagome rush outside.]
Fx Inuyasha: swish <Za_>
Fx sound: ta-dump... <Zuuun>



Page 16

[Down in the fishing village, a titanic Youkai is walking onto the land,
crushing a building casually with it's hand.]
Fx youkai: (walking) ta-dump <Zuuunn>



Page 17

[Kagome and Inuyasha look at the demon walking up towards them.]
Fx youkai: (walking) ta-dump <Zuuunn>
<Kagome:    a...>
Kagome: Ah...

2
[Closeup of Sesshoumaru sitting on the Youkai's shoulder, with Jaken next to
him. The Youkai that Sesshoumaru brought for his entrance this time, is
even bigger than the last time he appeared.]

3
[Miroku, Inuyasha, Kagome and Shippou look on in shock.]
<Inuyasha:    are wa...>
Inuyasha: That's...



Page 18
1
[Closeup of Sesshoumaru sitting on the shoulder, resting his chin on his
left arm, which looks 'normal', and smiling.]

2
[Closeup of Inuyasha looking surprised.]
<Inuyasha:    SESSHOUMARU...>
Inuyasha: Sesshoumaru...
