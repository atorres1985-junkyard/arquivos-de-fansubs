Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

[The group is rushing through some hills, with Kagome on Inuyasha's back.]
Fx Inuyasha: swish <Za_>
<Kagome:    acchi yo.>
Kagome: It's that way.
<Kagome:    kasuka ni SHIKON no kakera no KEHAI...>
Kagome: A faint _kehai_ of a Shikon fragment...
<Inuyasha:    SHICHININ-TAI ka!?>
Inuyasha: The Shichinin-tai!?

[Closeup of Kagome and Inuyasha.]
<Kagome:    sore ga... okashii no.>
Kagome: If so... it's strange.
<Inuyasha:    n?>
Inuyasha: Hm?

[Drawing of Jakotsu, Mukotsu and Renkotsu, all with glowing Shikon fragments
in their throats.]
<Kagome:    IMA made MIta SHICHININTAI no kakera wa, minna...>

[View of a building in a village in the hills.]
<villager:    ta, TAIHEN ja SUIKOTSU-sama!>
villager: {off} I, it's bad, Suikotsu-sama!
<villager:    TEAte o TANOn masu!>
villager: Please treat it!

4
[Suikotsu looks out from the building to see one village man helping another walk.]
<Suikotsu:    doushita?>
Suikotsu: What is it?
<villager:    koronda HYOUSHI ni Kama de ASHI o KItte...>
villager: He cut leg with a sickle when falling down...

(    Actually, the village says the guy cut through the man's "wooden clappers"
into his leg. I'm not quite sure what these are but they look like
shinguards - wooden supports wrapped around the shin. To make it easier
when working on the fields?)

5
[Closeup of the man's shin - blood is dripping heavily.]
Fx blood: *drip...* <Bota...>

[Closeup of Suikotsu looking strangely shocked.]

<Suikotsu:    a, aa, KIKYOU-sama.>
Suikotsu: Ah, sure, Kikyou-sama.
<Suikotsu:    TASUkari masu.>
Suikotsu: That's a great help.

2
[A bit later, Kikyou is holding the patient steady while Suikotsu treats the wound.]
<Suikotsu:    yokatta... OMOtta yori KIZU wa ASAi.>
Suikotsu: That's a relief... The wound's lighter than I thought.
<injured villager:    tsu~~~~>
injured villager: Oh~w~w~w

3
[Closeup of Kikyou looking off at something.]
Kikyou: ......?

4
[View of Suikotsu, who is sweating and seems to be in a bad way.]

Kikyou: Suikotsu-sama, you're sweating terribly.
<Kikyou:    WATASHI ga TEAte o kawari mashou.>
Kikyou: Let me take over from you.

[View of the sky. Later that day.]

2
[Suikotsu is sitting on the porch, with two children leaning on him, but he
doesn't seem to notice - he looks somewhat depressed.]
<Suikotsu:    SAKI hodo wa MENBOKUnai.>
Suikotsu: That was so undignified.
<Kikyou:    ie...>
Kikyou: It's okay...

3
[View of Kikyou looking at Suikotsu.]
<young girl:    SUIKOTSU-sama wa CHI ga NIGATE nan da yo ne.>
young girl: You grow faint at blood don't you, Suikotsu-sama.

<Suikotsu:    aa mattaku, ISHA no kuse ni...>

<Suikotsu:    CHI o MIru to, KARADA no OKU kara FURUete shimatte...>
Suikotsu: On seeing blood, I start shivering throughout my body...

5
[Closeup of Kikyou.]
<Kikyou:    SUIKOTSU-sama wa zutto kono MURA de oISHA o?>
Kikyou: Have you always been the doctor of this village, Suikotsu-sama?

6
[View of Suikotsu.]
<Suikotsu:    iya, Umare wa TOUGOKU desu.>
Suikotsu: No, I was born towards the east.
<Suikotsu:    iron na MURA de CHIRYOU o hodokoshite MAWAri, koko ni Itsuita...>
Suikotsu: I gave medical treatment to villages all over the place, and settled down here...

7
[View of Kikyou, looking off at Suikotsu.]
<Suikotsu:    kono MURA wa ii.>
Suikotsu: {off} This village is nice.
<Suikotsu:    MAZUshii ga, konna KITA no KANSON dakara koso,>
Suikotsu: It's poor, but because it's an isolated village so far north,
<Suikotsu:    IKUSA mo naku HEIWA da.>
Suikotsu: it's peaceful and untouched by war.

[Closeup of Kikyou, thinking.]
<Kikyou:    wakaran, kono SUIKOTSU to iu OTOKO...>

<Kikyou:    hai, YAKUSOU o TSUmi ni...>
Kikyou: {off} Yes, he's gathering herbs...

porch with some of the children around her.]
<Kikyou:    WATASHI ga, wakari ni oTEAte o...>
Kikyou: I am standing in for him...
<villager:    sou ka ne.>
villager: I see.

[Scene change. View of a clearing on a hill.]

[Suikotsu is with two children, all with baskets on their backs.]
<village child:    SUIKOTSU-sama, ari mashita.>
village child: Suikotsu-sama, there's some here.
<Suikotsu:    aa, Senburi da na.>
Suikotsu: Yup, that's _senburi_.
<Suikotsu:    HARA o JOUBU ni suru.>
Suikotsu: It's good for the stomach.

(    "Senburi" (Swertia japonica makino) seems to be a herb unique to Japan.
It's also good for hair loss treatment apparantly.)

3
[Suikotsu smiles at a young girl helping him.]
<Suikotsu:    kore o tottara KAErou na.>
Suikotsu: Let's return after picking it.
<village girl:    hai.>
village girl: Okay.

4
[The three look up to look at someone else approaching - Inuyasha's foot can
be seen in the foreground.]
Fx Inuyasha: shh... <Za...>

5
[It's Inuyasha and co, looking serious.]
Fx group: shh <Za_>

[Closeup of Inuyasha.]
<Inuyasha:    temee...>
Inuyasha: You're...
<Inuyasha:    SHICHININ-TAI da na!?>
Inuyasha: one of the Shichinin-tai aren't you!?

2
[Closeup of Suikotsu looking confused.]
Suikotsu: ......
<Suikotsu:    e.....?>
Suikotsu: Eh......?

3
[Misty frame. Scene change.]

4
[View of the sky - seems to be evening.]
<villager:    SUIKOTSU-sama ga kono MURA ni KITA no wa, choudo...>

<villager:    SHICHININ-ZUKA ga KOWArete MAmonaku da naa.>
villager: the Shichinin Grave was broken.

[Kikyou is treating the old man's arm.]
<Kikyou:    SHICHININ-ZUKA ga?>
Kikyou: As the Shichinin Grave?
<villager:    hee, shikamo SUIKOTSU to iu NA ga...>
villager: Yeah, also, the name Suikotsu...

[Misty flash-back scene. A group of soldiers are in the hills, with snow all
around. A pair of soldiers seem to be holding someone down while another
approaches with a sword raised - for an execution.]
<villager:    JUU NAN NEN ka MAE ni TOUGOKU kara NOGArete KIte, kono MURA de UchiKUBIni sareta GEDOU no SHUUDAN...>
villager: {off} Over ten years ago, a despicable group came fleeing from the east and were beheaded at this village...
<villager:    SHICHININ-TAI no NAKA no hitori to ONAji NA datta mon dakara,>
villager: Among the Shichinin-tai was one with the same name,
<villager:    TSUKA kara NIgeDAshita BOUREI ka to, SAWAgi DAsu MURABITO mo otta ga...>
villager: there was an outcry among the villagers that he might be a zombie from the grave, but...

2
[Closeup of Kikyou.]
<Kikyou:    SHICHININ-ZUKA no BOUREI...>
Kikyou: .oO(Zombie from the Shichinin Grave...).
<Kikyou:    SUIKOTSU-sama ga sono... BOUREI da to?>
Kikyou: Suikotsu-sama is that... zombie?

3
[The villager makes some pacifying motions.]
<villager:    to, tondemonee_.>
villager: N, not at all!
<villager:    NAMAE wa ONAji SUIKOTSU demo, NItemo NItsukanee_.>
villager: Even though their name's the same, they have nothing in common!

4
[The village makes a motion towards himself.]
<villager:    ore wa, SHICHININ-TAI ga Utareru no o MIte-ta n-da.>
villager: I saw it when the Shichinin-tai were attacked.
<villager:    MUKASHI no KOTO dakedo, Hakkiri OBOete-ru.>
villager: It's a long time ago, but I remember it clearly.



Page 10
1
[Vague closeup side view of someone. Appears to be human but looks almost
like he's possessed by a demon - dark, angry and evil.]
<villager:    SHICHININ-TAI no SUIKOTSU tte yatsu wa,>
villager: The "Suikotsu" of the Shichinin-tai,
<villager:    RASETSU mitee ni ossoroshii GYOUSOU o shita OTOKO datta...>
villager: He had a terrifying face, like that of a _rasetsu_...

(    A/the Rasetsu is rather like an Oni (ie a particular type of demon) and
there's a few legends, manga, anime and games out there with characters
called Rasetsu for example. A male Rasetsu is generally a ugly demon that
eats humans (while the females are apparantly very beautiful). Maybe
"berserker" would an appropriate translation - I feel there's a dark hidden
side to Suikotsu, possibly awakened by blood, death and fear.)

2
[Scene change - back to Suikotsu facing Inuyasha.]
<Suikotsu:    ma, MAte.>
Suikotsu: Wh, wait.
<Suikotsu:    HITOCHIGAi dewa nai no ka?>
Suikotsu: Haven't you got the wrong person?

3
[Closeup of Suikotsu looking nervous.]
<Suikotsu:    WATASHI wa ISHA da.>
Suikotsu: I'm a doctor.
<Suikotsu:    anata-gata wa ittai...?>
Suikotsu: Who on earth are you people...?

4
[Closeup of Inuyasha, tensing and angry.]
<Inuyasha:    toboketa tte MUDA da.>
Inuyasha: It's futile to play dumb.
<Inuyasha:    temee no KARADA kara, SHICHININ-TAI to ONAji...>
Inuyasha: From your body, just like with the Shichinin-tai...
Fx Inuyasha: rustle... <Zawa...>



Page 11
1
[Inuyasha charges forwards.]
Fx Inuyasha: swish <Za_>
<Inuyasha:    SHIBITO to HAKATSUCHI no NIOi ga suru!>
Inuyasha: The smell of a corpse and burial soil!

2
[Suikotsu looks shocked.]
<Suikotsu:    SHIBITO...>
Suikotsu: .oO(Corpse...).
<Suikotsu:    WATASHI ga!?>
Suikotsu: .oO(I am!?).

3
[The two children look scared are pull Suikotsu back.]
<young boy:    SUIKOTSU-sama_.>

Kagome: Don't hurt the children!!

2
[Inuyasha looks back angrily.]
<Inuyasha:    urusee, wakatte-ru!>
Inuyasha: Shuddup, I know that!

3
[Inuyasha makes a powerful downwards sweep, though he only strikes the
ground. Suikotsu was at the edge of the clearing which is beside a slope
and avoiding Inuyasha meant jumping off the slope.]
<Inuyasha:    SHOUTAI ARAWAshi yagare!>
Inuyasha: Show your real fucking form!
Fx ground: wham <Doka_>
<Suikotsu:    uwa_!>
Suikotsu: Uwah!



Page 13

[Suikotsu slides down the slope.]
Fx ground: skrsh-skrsh <Dozaza>

2
[The village kids look down in shock with Inuyasha behind them.]
<village girl:    SUIKOTSU-sama!>
village girl: Suikotsu-sama!

3
[The boy kicks Inuyasha in the side, to no apparent effect.]
<village boy:    teme-, nani sunda.>
village boy: You bastard, what're you doing.
Fx village boy: whack <Don>

4
[The kids run down to where Suikotsu has come to a stop at the bottom of the slope.]
<village boy:    SUIKOTSU-sama.>
village boy: Suikotsu-sama.
<village girl:    DAIJOUBU!?>
village girl: Are you okay!?

5
[Miroku has come over to Inuyasha.]
Fx Miroku: shh <Za_>
<Miroku:    doumo Gara no WARUi omae ga, ZENRYOU na OTOKO ni karande iru you ni shika MIen na.>
Miroku: It looks purely like a brute picking a fight with an innocent man.
<Inuyasha:    nandei MIROKU.>
Inuyasha: What, Miroku.

6
[Miroku and Inuyasha "discuss" things.]
<Miroku:    IMA made no SHICHININ-TAI to wa, KANji ga CHIGAi sugiru to Itte-ru n-da.>
Miroku: I'm saying that compared to the Shichinin-tai so far, the feeling is too different.
<Inuyasha:    ke_.>
Inuyasha: Bah!
<Inuyasha:    SHIBAI ni KImatte n-daro!>
Inuyasha: It's gotta be an act!



Page 14

[Everyone looks off at a sound.]
Fx sound: {off} ka-booom <Zun>
Suikotsu: !

2
[Closeup of Inuyasha.]
Inuyasha: !?

3
[Down in the village, a house is burning heavily and looks almost destroyed.]
Fx flames: roa-a-ar <Go--->

4
[Suikotsu and the villages look off in shock.]
<village girl:    su, SUIKOTSU-sama...>
village girl: Su, Suikotsu-sama...
<Suikotsu:    MURA ga...>
Suikotsu: The village...

5
[Down in the village some villages are running away in terror from a burning house.]
Fx flames: roa-a-r... <Go--...>
<villager#1:    wa--->
villager#1: Whaaah!
<villager#2:    hiii---_.>
villager#2: Yeeek!

<Kikyou:    dou shimashita!>
Kikyou: What happened!?
<villager:    ki, KIKYOU-sa...>
villager: Ki, Kikyou-sa...

2
[Suddenly another house explodes.]
Fx house: ka-booom <Dooon>

3
[Closeup of Kikyou looking off in shock as smoking bits rain down near her.]
Fx bits: clatter clatter <Bara Bara Bara>

4
[In the distance, hidden by some smoke is what appears to be a large vehicle
and a gun turret on top (a tank basically). Two people are sitting on top
of it.]
Fx air: whoosh... <Go--->
Kikyou: {off} !



Page 16
1
[Closeup of the thing - it is kinda like a tank. Has two cannon barrels at
the top (one smoking), with buzz-saw wheels and some other weird bits. In
the middle on top is Ginkotsu's head - he seems welded to the machine. On
either side of him are Jakotsu and Renkotsu.]
Fx tank: creak... <Gi...>
Fx tank: rumble... <Gooo>
<Ginkotsu:    gishi_...>
Ginkotsu: Geh-sh...

2
[Closeup of Kikyou looking a bit stunned. She has her bow with her.]

Kikyou: .oO(These guys are...).



Page 17

[Kikyou looks to the side.]
<Suikotsu:    KIKYOU-sama.>
Suikotsu: {off} Kikyou-sama.

2
[Suikotsu approached.]
Fx Suikotsu: *stagger...* <Yoro...>
<Suikotsu:    ko, kore wa ittai...>
Suikotsu: Wh, what on earth...

3
[View of Kikyou and Suikotsu standing together.]
<Renkotsu:    konna toko ni I yagatta ka...>
Renkotsu: {off} So you were in a dump like this eh...

4
[Closeup of the three Shichinin-tai.]
Fx tank: rumble... <Gooo...>
<Renkotsu:    yoo, SUIKOTSU.>
Renkotsu: Hey there, Suikotsu.
<Ginkotsu:    gishi_.>
Ginkotsu: Ge-sh.
<Jakotsu:    _taku, MENDOU kake yagatte yo-.>
Jakotsu: Sheesh, you gave us a lot of trouble.

[Closeup of Suikotsu looking confused.]
<Suikotsu:    na_...!?>
Suikotsu: Wha...!?

[Closeup of Renkotsu.]

Kikyou: .oO(What's going on!?).
