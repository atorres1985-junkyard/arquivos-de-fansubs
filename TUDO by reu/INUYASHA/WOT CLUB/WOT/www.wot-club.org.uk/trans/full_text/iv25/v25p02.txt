Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

Page 10

[Closeup of Jakotsu looking annoyed.]

[View of a Saimyoushou insect up above the hut.]
Fx Saimyoushou: buz... <Bu...>

2
[Closeup of the glowing Shikon fragment in the floor, near Mukotsu's skull.]
Fx fragment: *high pitched ringing* <Kii-n>

3
[The Saimyoushou flies past, taking the fragment.]
Fx Saimyoushou: fwip <Ba_>
Inuyasha: !

4
[The Saimyoushou flies off into the distance.]
Fx Saimyoushou: buzz... <Bubu...>

[Scene change. View of a forest.]

2
[Rin and Jaken are sitting on a fallen over tree trunk. That two-headed
dragon steed is nearby. Rin is waving her feet around, looking bored.]
<Rin:    JAKEN-sama,>
Rin: Jaken-sama,
<Rin:    SESSHOUMARU-sama OSOi nee.>
Rin: Sesshoumaru-sama sure is late.
<Rin:    rin mo ISSHO ni Ikeba yokatta-.>
Rin: Rin should have gone too.
<Jaken:    Baka mono.>
Jaken: Fool.

3
[Closeup of Jaken looking annoyed.]
<Jaken:    SESSHOUMARU-sama wa, DOKU no KEHAI no aru tokoro ni Ikareta no da.>
Jaken: Sesshoumaru-sama has gone to a place with poison around.
<Jaken:    omae nanzo ga tsuite Ittara, hitotamarimonai zo.>
Jaken: If he brought someone like you, you'd be a gonner for sure.

4
[Rin puts her hands behind her head, sighing.]
<Rin:    ha~~~_, tsumannai na~~>
Rin: *si-i-igh* I'm bo-o-red...

5
[Closeup of Rin looking over at something.]

6
[In the distance in the forest is a faint figure. Seems to be Kohaku.]
Fx leaves: rustle... <Sawa...>

7
[Closeup of the figure - it is Kohaku.]

8
[Closeup of Rin looking surprised.]
<Rin:    e... KOHAKU!?>

[Kohaku puts up his hand, and a Saimyoushou carrying a Shikon fragment lands
on it.]

3
[Jaken turns to look at Rin.]
<Jaken:    doushita, rin.>
Jaken: What's up, Rin?
<Rin:    e.>
Rin: Eh?

4
[Rin turns around.]
<Rin:    ...nandemonai.>
Rin: ...It's nothing.

5
[Closeup of Rin looking to the side.]

6
[View of the forest where Kohaku was. Nobody there now.]
Fx leaves: rustle... <Sawa...>

7
[Closeup of Rin thinking, looking a bit sad.]
<Rin:    SESSHOUMARU-sama... KONDO Attara,>
Rin: .oO(Sesshoumaru-sama... Next time they meet,).
<Rin:    KOHAKU mo KOROshichau no ka na...>
Rin: .oO(I wonder if he'll kill Kohaku too...).

(    Note, they way Rin says this suggests that she thinks this is a bad thing.)



Page 15
1
[Scene change to a series of steps leading up to a Buddhist temple.]

2
[On a balcony around a building in the temple, Jakotsu is talking to
someone, presumably another one of the Shichinin-tai. On the ground near
the temple is a group of human bodies, covered with mats.]
<Shichinin-tai:    sou ka... KYOUKOTSU ni TSUZUite, MUKOTSU mo SHInda ka.>
Shichinin-tai: I see... So after Kyoukotsu, Mukotsu has also died huh.
<Jakotsu:    a-.>
Jakotsu: Yeah.

3
[Closeup of the new Shichinin-tai member. Seems to be a Buddhist priest from
his clothes. He certainly an adult but he doesn't look old, he is
completely bald though. A bit like Jakotsu, he has two dark lines from his
eyes, except his are wider and go above the eyes. He also has a strange but
simple mark on his forehead. He seems like a cold person.]
<Shichinin-tai:    de... MUKOTSU o KOROshita no wa dou iu yatsu da?>
Shichinin-tai: So... What type of person killed Mukotsu?

4
[Closeup of Jakotsu thinking, looking a bit sullen.]
<Jakotsu:    nanka, TSUMEtai MEe shita yatsu de you.>
Jakotsu: Somehow, he seemed cold to me.
<Jakotsu:    OTOKOMAE to Iya sou nan dakedo.>
Jakotsu: He definitely seemed handsome though.



Page 16
1
[Jakotsu has now turned away, a wondering expression.]
<Jakotsu:    yappa ore to shite wa, INUYASHA mite- na KAWAIGE no aru yatsu no hou ga...>
Jakotsu: In the end, I prefer types like Inuyasha who are a bit naive...
<Shichinin-tai:    DARE ga kisama no OTOKO no KONOmi o KIite iru ka.>
Shichinin-tai: Who asked you about your tastes in men.

2
[Closeup of Jakotsu looking annoyed.]
<Jakotsu:    demo yo, RENKOTSU no ANIKI.>
Jakotsu: But you know, Renkotsu no aniki.
<Jakotsu:    ore-tachi, SHIrasetenai koto ga OOsuginee ka?>
Jakotsu: Don't you think there's too much we haven't been told?
<Jakotsu:    DAIICHI, ore-tachi SHICHININ-TAI o IkiKAEraseta NARAKU tte yatsu...>
Jakotsu: First of all, this Naraku guy who resurrected us Shichinin-tai...

(    "Renkotsu no aniki" - "aniki" is rough slang for "elder brother" though
this is almost certainly not because Jakotsu is related to Renkotsu, but
that Renkotsu is just higher up than him. So "Renkotsu no aniki" is kinda
like "elder brother Renkotsu" where "Shichinin-tai" is the family. Anyway,
the "ren" from "Renkotsu" means refine (as in refine metals), and "kotsu"
means "bones" as usual.)

3
[Jakotsu leans forwards to talk to his comrade.]
<Jakotsu:    ittai NANIMONO nanda yo.>
Jakotsu: Just who the hell is he?
<Jakotsu:    ANIKI, omae wa Atta koto aru no ka?>
Jakotsu: Aniki, have you met him?
<Renkotsu:    NARAKU ni Atta no wa OO-ANIKI dake da.>
Renkotsu: Only Oo-aniki has met Naraku.

(    Another term of reference, "oo-aniki" is literally means "large elder
brother". I guess the meaning is "eldest brother" - ie the leader of the Renkotsu.)

4
[Drawing of several glowing Shikon fragments.]
<Renkotsu:    NARAKU wa OO-ANIKI ni SHIKON no kakera o WATAshita.>
Renkotsu: {off} Naraku gave Oo-aniki the Shikon fragments.
<Renkotsu:    ore-tachi no BUN mo na.>
Renkotsu: Enough for us too.
<Renkotsu:    NARAKU o Ou MONO o MINA-GOROshi ni shitara, kakera wa kono mama ore-tachi no mono ni naru tte YAKUSOKU da.>
Renkotsu: Naraku promised to let us keep the fragments we have now if we kill all those coming after him.



Page 17
1
[View of Jakotsu talking to his comrade, looking a bit dejected.]
<Jakotsu:    tte, mou FUTARI mo KAEriUchi ni sarete n-ze.>
Jakotsu: But, two of us have been killed instead already.
<Jakotsu:    SHICHININ-TAI mo NOKOri wa YONIN ka yo.>
Jakotsu: There's only four left in the "Shichinin-tai".
Renkotsu: ......
<Renkotsu:    SHICHININ kara FUTARI KAketara, GONIN da zo.>
Renkotsu: If you remove 2 people from 7, that leaves 5 people.

2
[Closeup of Renkotsu.]
<Renkotsu:    sore yori JAKOTSU.>
Renkotsu: Anyway Jakotsu.
<Renkotsu:    INUYASHA no TSUre-tachi wa...>
Renkotsu: Inuyasha's companions...
<Renkotsu:    MUKOTSU no DOKU o Abita to Itta na.>
Renkotsu: were sprayed by Mukotsu's poison, you said.

3
[Closeup side view of Jakotsu.]
<Jakotsu:    aa, MUKOTSU no DOKU wa shitsuke- kara na,>
Jakotsu: Yeah, since Mukotsu's poison is long lasting,
<Jakotsu:    yatsu-ra shibaraku UGOkenee hazu da.>
Jakotsu: those lot aren't likely to be moving for a while.

4
[Scene change to a view of some trees.]

5
[The group are near a waterfall. Kagome, Miroku and Sango are all lying on
the ground, with Shippou and Inuyasha near Kagome.]
<Shippou:    DOKUKEshi no YAKUSOU o NOmaseta ga...>
Shippou: They drank the poison antidote herbs, but...
<Shippou:    MINA, YASUmasenai to abunai to OMOu zo.>
Shippou: I think it'd be dangerous if they don't all take a rest.

6
[Closeup of Inuyasha looking a bit worried.]
<Inuyasha:    aa...>
Inuyasha: Yeah...
<Inuyasha:    dokoka, ANZEN na BASHO o SAGAsanee to na.>
Inuyasha: We gotta find a safe place somewhere.



Page 18
1
[Scene change back to Renkotsu and Jakotsu.]
<Renkotsu:    kukuku... omoshiroku natte kita na.>
Renkotsu: Kukuku... It's gotten interesting.
<Renkotsu:    JITSU wa na, IMA...>
Renkotsu: Actually, right now...

2
[View of mat covered corpses on the temple court-yard. Maybe they were burnt
to death.]
<Renkotsu:    GINKOTSU ga INUYASHA-tachi no tokoro ni MUkatte iru.>
Renkotsu: Ginkotsu is heading towards where Inuyasha is.
<Renkotsu:    yatsu-ra o kono TERA ni OiKOmu tame ni na.>
Renkotsu: In order to bring the group to this temple.

(    "Ginkotsu" literally translates as "silver bones")

3
[Scene change. View of, presumably, Ginkotsu, who is very heavily armed - is
carrying a spear, a sword, a large axe, what looks like a set of buzz-saws
on his back, and a simple gun (there were a few around back then). He also
has a large guard over most of his face, though part of his head is
stitched together with some cloth, and his left arm is artificial. He's
also heavily armoured.]
Fx weapons: clang <Gashan>
Fx Ginkotsu: hshht... <Shu--...>
