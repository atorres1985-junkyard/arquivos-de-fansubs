Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

[Scene change - misty frame.]

[Closeup of Toutousai and Kagome - Shippou is sitting behind Kagome.]
<Kagome:    RYUUKOSSEI no FUUIN ga TOkareta tte iu no?>
Kagome: You mean Ryuukossei's seal has been broken?
<Toutousai:    sou to shika OMOen.>
Toutousai: That's the only thing I can think of.
<Toutousai:    ...to naru to,>
Toutousai: ... In which case,

2
[Closeup side view of Toutousai, making a point.]
<Toutousai:    YOMIGAEtta RYUUKOSSEI o TAOsu HOUHOU wa tada hitotsu,>
Toutousai: there is only one way to defeat the revived Ryuukossei,
<Toutousai:    BAKURYUUHA o kurawasu shika...>
Toutousai: hit it with the Bakuryuuha...

3
[View of Kagome and Toutousai.]
<Kagome:    BAKURYUU... nani sore?>
Kagome: Bakuryuu-... what's that?
<Toutousai:    TETSUSAIGA no OUGI mitee na mon sa.>
Toutousai: It's Tetsusaiga's Ougi, as it were.

4
[Kagome and Toutousai look back at Miroku.]
<Miroku:    OUGI to MOUshi masu to...>
Miroku: You say Ougi, so...
<Miroku:    "KAZE no KIZU" yori sugoi to iu koto de?>
Miroku: you mean it's greater than the "Cutting Wind" then?
<Toutousai:    KAZE no KIZU nanza, SHOSHINSHA YOU no WAZA yo.>
Toutousai: The Cutting Wind is like a beginner's attack.

(    For such a short word, 'Ougi' is rather hard to explain. Imagine a school
of martial arts - the 'Ougi' would only be know to the master of the entire
school, and maybe some others. It basically indicates the ultimate grade,
typically for things like martial art attacks, or spells and so on.
Bakuryuuha is a bit weird/vague (like most 'special attack' names), but
translates something like "explosive-style-attack". The '-ha' at the end is
often used as a suffix in special attack names and the kanji basically
means 'destory'.)

<Kagome:    sonna...>
Kagome: But that's...
<Kagome:    INUYASHA wa KAZE no KIZU dokoroka, TETSUSAIGA o FUru no ga yatto na no yo.>
Kagome: Inuyasha can barely swing Tetsusaiga, let alone do the Cutting Wind.
<Kagome:    mashiteya OUGI nante...>
Kagome: To say nothing of doing the _Ougi_...
<Toutousai:    yappa MURI ka na-.>
Toutousai: I guess it's impossible.
