Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

smiling a bit smugly.]

Title: Shikigami

(    As explained previously, 'shikigami' is somewhat like 'familiar'. In this
case, it's Tsubaki's demonic snake.)

[View of the trio - Kagome looks almost unconscious.]
<Miroku:    TSUBAKI no yatsu, douse INUYASHA o KATAZUketara kagome-SAMA mo JUSATSUsuru KI da.>

<Sango:    NOROi o YABUru HOUHOU wa nai no!?>
Sango: Isn't there a way to break the curse!?

[Closeup side view of Miroku thinking.]

Miroku: Before she collapsed previously, she said she'd been bitten by something.
<Miroku:    sore wa osoraku KURO MIKO no SHIKIGAMI...>

[Closeup of the Fuda burning to ashes.]
Fx fuda: whomp whomp <Bo_ Bo_>

<Tsubaki:    WATASHI no NOROi wa YABUrenu!>

<Tsubaki:    kagome o SAKI ni ano YO ni OKUtte yaru ka!?>
Tsubaki: send Kagome to the afterlife sooner rather than later huh!?
Fx Tsubaki: (Jewel) *grip...* <Gyu...>

2
[Closeup of an arrow rushing through the air, leaving a large glowing trail.]
Fx arrow: whoosh <Go_>

3
[The arrow strikes the stairs leading to the shrine building itself, just
next to Tsubaki. It gives off a large flash of light as it hits, but seems
to do little actual damage.]
Fx arrow: wham <Doka_>
Tsubaki: !



Page 8
1
[View of Sango and Kagome, who has just fired the arrow. Sango looks
concerned, while Kagome looks determined, if a little weak.]
<Sango:    kagome-chan...>
Sango: Kagome-chan...

[Closeup of Kagome - she looks pretty angry. She's also preparing to shoot
another arrow.]
<Kagome:    anta...>
Kagome: You...
<Kagome:    SHUUCHUURYOKU TArinai n-ja nai no!?>
Kagome: do you have weak powers of concentration or something!?
Fx Kagome: (arrow) *prepare...* <Cha...>

2
[Closeup of Tsubaki.]
<Tsubaki:    WATASHI ga HAMA no FUDA ni KI o torareta wazuka na SUKI ni KAIFUKUshita no ka.>
Tsubaki: So you recovered in the small opening when I was distracted by the exorcism Fuda huh.
<Tsubaki:    KIKYOU no Umarekawari to iu no wa Uso dewa nai rashii na.>
Tsubaki: It seems that it wasn't a lie that you're Kikyou's reincarnation.

3
[Closeup of Tsubaki, smiling.]
<Tsubaki:    mottomo,>
Tsubaki: However,
<Tsubaki:    HONMONO no KIKYOU nara IMA no YA, KAKUJITSU ni WATASHI ni Atete ita darou ga na.>
Tsubaki: if the real Kikyou had shot that arrow just now, it would have surely have hit me, wouldn't it.

4
[View of Kagome.]
<Tsubaki:    SHOSEN wa KIKYOU no magaimono ka.>
Tsubaki: {off} In the end, you're just a pale shadow of Kikyou huh.

5
[Closeup of Kagome getting quite obviously angry, gritting her teeth.]

Kagome: I'm not anybody else!!
Fx arrow: pow <Bashi>

2
[Tsubaki steps back a bit looking a bit afraid as the arrow smashes into the
steps in front of her. It's glowing brightly but doesn't seem to do a lot
of damage.]
Fx arrow: wham <Do_>
<Tsubaki:    fu_.>
Tsubaki: Humph.

(    I wonder if Kagome is deliberately aiming low - after all, it probably
wouldn't be a good idea if she hit the Shikon no Tama again...)

3
[Closeup of Tsubaki, looking kinda angry. The snake coils to where she's
holding out the Shikon no Tama.]
<Tsubaki:    OROka MONO!>
Tsubaki: Fool!
<Tsubaki:    SHI ni ISOgi otte!>
Tsubaki: You're speeding your own death!

[Inuyasha rushes forwards.]
<Inuyasha:    kagome-_!>
Inuyasha: Kagome-e!
Fx Inuyasha: *dash* <Da_>

3
[Inuyasha picks up a limp Kagome and jumps to the side as the large Youkai
makes another swipe, and Sango jumps to the side as well.]
Fx ground: wham <Dan>
<Inuyasha:    ku_.>
Inuyasha: Ugh.

4
[Closeup of Inuyasha looking worriedly at Kagome, who has her eyes closed.]
<Inuyasha:    kagome!>
Inuyasha: Kagome!



Page 13

[Closeup side view of Inuyasha.]
<Inuyasha:    kono mama ja...>
Inuyasha: .oO(At this rate...).
<Inuyasha:    kagome no KARADA ga motanee!>
Inuyasha: .oO(Kagome's body won't be able to take it!).

2
[View of Tsubaki.]
<Tsubaki:    ONNA tomodomo HIkiSAite kureru.>
Tsubaki: I'll rip you apart along with the girl.

3
[Inuyasha looks up in shock to see the large Youkai about to strike him and Kagome.]

Page 14
1
[Inuyasha turns to Kagome worriedly. (hmm, it's almost like we're missing a
frame here - Inuyasha doesn't seem to be in any particular hurry)]
<Inuyasha:    kagome.>
Inuyasha: Kagome.
<Inuyasha:    mou SUKOshi ganbareru ka!?>

2
[Closeup of Kagome with her eyes closed.]

4
[Inuyasha stands up as the large Youkai rushes towards him.]
<Inuyasha:    ZETTAI ni omae o KOROsase ya shinee!>
Inuyasha: .oO(I definitely won't let you be killed!).
Fx Inuyasha: shh <Za_>
Fx youkai: swish... <Za-->



Page 15
1
[Inuyasha charges forward angrily, claws tensed.]
Fx Inuyasha: swish <Za_>
<Inuyasha:    JAMA da ZAKO gaa!>
Inuyasha: Outta the way you wimp!

2
[Inuyasha literally rips through the large Youkai.]
<Inuyasha:    SANKON TESSOU!!>
Inuyasha: Sankon Tessou!! (Soul Shattering Iron Claw)
Fx youkai: wham <Doga_>

(    Note, I changed 'Sankon Tetsusou' to 'Sankon Tessou', since that's how it's
pronounced in the TV anime. It actually isn't clear in the manga, and it's
simpler to go with the anime version and it's probably the author's
intention anyway... I'm going to have to change 'Tetsusaiga' to 'Tessaiga'
as well, I think...)



Page 16

[Miroku and Sango look on in surprise as bits of Youkai rain down.]

and is now heading right at Tsubaki.]

Page 17

[Inuyasha makes a powerful swipe with his claws at Tsubaki.]
<Inuyasha:    kore made da!>
Inuyasha: This is it!
Fx Inuyasha: swish <Za_>

2
[Tsubaki looks on in shock as the head of the snake is ripped off.]
<Tsubaki:    SHIKIGAMI o...>
Tsubaki: .oO(The Shikigami...).

3
[Miroku rushes forwards as the head bounces to the ground.]
<Miroku:    dekashita INUYASHA.>
Miroku: Well done Inuyasha.
Fx Miroku: swish <Za_>
Fx head: thunk <Dan>



Page 18

[Miroku stabs the base of his staff into the snake's head.]
Fx staff: whack <Doka>

2
[The head dissolves away.]
Fx head: sizzle... <Ju--->

3
[Inuyasha faces Tsubaki, ready to strike.]

Inuyasha: Give it up, Tsubaki...
Fx Inuyasha: *crack knuckles...* <Baki...>

[Closeup of Tsubaki with a cold look, and the background goes all menacing.]
<Tsubaki:    AMAi na...>
Tsubaki: How naive...
<Tsubaki:    sorede NOROi o TAchiKItta tsumori ka.>
Tsubaki: Did you think to sever the curse with that?
Fx Tsubaki: *stir of power...* <Zawa...>

Inuyasha: .oO(Wha!?).
