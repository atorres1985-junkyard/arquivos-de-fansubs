Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

wraps around Kagome's lower leg.]
Fx snake: swish <Sha_>

2
[Kagome winces in pain.]
<Kagome:    a_,>
Kagome: Ah!
<Kagome:    ITA...>

light coming from below her throat/bottom of her neck.]
Fx Kagome: thunk... <Do...>
<Inuyasha:    kagome.>
Inuyasha: {off} Kagome.

2
[Scene change. The blood from the snake from earlier is being dripped onto
the large Shikon 'fragment' Naraku has - it's almost a complete ball. A
hand is holding the snake's head.]
Fx blood: (dropping on Jewel) pish... <Pichi...>



Page 17
1
[Drawing of the nearly complete Jewel and two fragments, all glowing darkly.]
<Tsubaki:    ONNA no KARADA ni haitta SHIKON no kakera wa,>
Tsubaki: {off} The Shikon fragments in the girl's body,
<Tsubaki:    kono NARAKU no KEGAre ni MIchita TAMA to KYOUMEIshi...>
Tsubaki: resonate with the Jewel covered by Naraku's taint...
<Tsubaki:    ONNA o mushibande iku...>
Tsubaki: and is slowly destorying her...

<Tsubaki:    kagome to yara wa, JUSO o Uketa koto ni sura, KIzuite inakatta zo.>
Tsubaki: This Kagome, didn't even notice that the Juso(*) had struck her.
<note:    MONOGOTO o HAGEshiku NOROu koto>
note to readers: (*) An intense curse on something.

(    the 'note the readers' is a comment in the actual manga explaining the
meaning of 'Juso'. According to my dictionary, 'Juso' just means 'curse',
but 'noroi' also means curse. 'Juso' is basically a really nasty curse.)



Page 18

[View of Tsubaki continuing to look at Naraku.]
<Tsubaki:    KIKYOU no Umarekawari to iu kara,>
Tsubaki: You said she's Kikyou's reincarnation,

<Tsubaki:    soretomo...>
Tsubaki: Or...

3
[Closeup side view of Naraku.]
<Naraku:    kukuku...>
Naraku: Kukuku...
<Naraku:    INUYASHA ni FUTATAbi WARUi YUME demo misete yaru ka na.>
Naraku: How about making Inuyasha experiance a bad dream again.

4
[Dark frame.]
<Naraku:    ITOshii ONNA to KOROshi au--->
Naraku: To die with his beloved girl...
<Naraku:    NATSUKAshii YUME o na.>
Naraku: A nice familiar dream.

[Scene change back to Kaede's hut. Everyone is crowded around Kagome who is
lying flat on the ground, eyes glazed over.]
<Inuyasha:    oi_,>

<Inuyasha:    shikkari shiro kagome.>
Inuyasha: Hang in there Kagome.
<Miroku:    KARADA no NAKA ni kakera ga...>

<Kaede:    SAKI hodo no JAKI to ii...>

[Closeup of Kaede thinking.]
<Kaede:    NANIMONOka ga kagome o NOROtte iru...?>
