Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

2
[Double page view of the blast-front rushing towards Ryuukossei, which also
seems to be pulling Ryuukossei's blast along with it. It seems to be made
of many overlapping blades of wind.]
Fx blast: wham-am-am-am <Gagagagaga>
Ryuukossei: !

[What appear to be blades at the front of the blast are in fact a massive
volley of tornados, and they smash into Ryuukossei's body, cutting right
through it.]

[Kagome and Shippou (with Toutousai still on his ox) come rushing towards
Inuyasha happily.]
<Kagome:    INUYASHA-!>
Kagome: Inuyasha-a!
<Inuyasha:    kagome...>
Inuyasha: Kagome...

2
[Kagome is standing in front of Inuyasha, hands clasped, looking impressed.
Shippou is clinging to Inuyasha.]
<Kagome:    sugo-i! nande anna koto dekita no!?>
Kagome: _Amazing_! How were you able to do that!?
<Inuyasha:    iya...>
Inuyasha: Well...

3
[Toutousai approaches Inuyasha.]
<Toutousai:    INUYASHA, omae...>
Toutousai: Inuyasha, you...

4
[Closeup of Inuyasha.]
<Inuyasha:    sokka, TOUTOUSAI omae...>
Inuyasha: That's right, Toutousai, you're...

5
[Inuyasha happily shoves Toutousai to the side, knocking him down.]
<Inuyasha:    tama ni wa KI no kiita koto suru ja ne- ka!>
Inuyasha: sometimes you're pretty smart you know!
Fx Inuyasha: {comically} *knock* <Do-n>



Page 11

[Closeup of Inuyasha holding up Tetsusaiga (in it's scabbard), smiling widely.]
<Inuyasha:    TETSUSAIGA ni nanka SHIKAke shitoita n-daro!?
                                          shite oita
>
Inuyasha: You setup some kinda trick in Tetsusaiga didn't you!?
<Inuyasha:    MAE yori ZENZEN sugee ja nee ka.>
Inuyasha: It's far more amazing than earlier, isn't it.

2
[Inuyasha talks to Toutousai, who is upside-down, balanced on his head, but
has his arms calmly folded. (I remember Ranma doing this quite often, after
getting knocked flying...)]
<Toutousai:    tte omae...>
Toutousai: Hey, you mean...
<Toutousai:    nannimo wakarande yacchimatta no ka.>
Toutousai: you did that without knowing _anything_ then?
Fx Toutousai: clunk... <mishi...>
<Inuyasha:    n~?>
Inuyasha: Hn~n?

3
[Closeup of Toutousai, after righting himself.]
<Toutousai:    IMA no wa TETSUSAIGA no OUGI...>
Toutousai: That just now was Tetsusaiga's  _Ougi_...
<Toutousai:    BAKURYUUHA da yo.>
Toutousai: the Bakuryuuha.

4
[Closeup of Inuyasha looking a bit confused, but serious.]
<Inuyasha:    BAKURYUUHA...?>
Inuyasha: Bakuryuuha...?



Page 12
1
[Drawing of when the Bakuryuuha was rushing along, carrying Ryuukossei's
blast too.]
<Toutousai:    sayou, BAKURYUUHA to wa...>
Toutousai: {off} Indeed, the Bakuryuuha is...
<Toutousai:    AITE no YOUKI o KAZE no KIZU ni MAkiKOmi, YOUKI o GYAKURYUUsaseru HISSATSU-KEN...>
Toutousai: a deadly sword-form that envelops the opponent's _Youki_ in the Cutting Wind, reverses the flow of the _Youki_...

2
[Drawing of then Ryuukossei's body was smashed up by the tornados.]
<Toutousai:    karamiatta KAZE no KIZU to YOUKI wa, UZU to natte OshiMODOsare...>
Toutousai: {off} The coiled Cutting Wind and the _Youki_, becomes a swirl and pushes back...
<Toutousai:    SHITAGAtte, TEKI wa JIBUN no HASshita YOUKI to, TETSUSAIGA no IRYOKU o matomete Abiru koto ni naru.>
Toutousai: consequently, the enemy is bathed in it's own _Youki_ blast and Tetsusaiga's explosive power.

3
[Back to Toutousai explaining to Inuyasha.]
<Inuyasha:    hee.>
Inuyasha: Hmm.
<Toutousai:    ...to, maa sou iu RIKUTSU nan daga...>
Toutousai: ...well, that's the theory at least...



Page 13
1
[Closeup of Toutousai.]
<Toutousai:    sore ni shita tte, YOUKI no doko o KIru ka YOmenakya naranee shi,>
Toutousai: At any rate, you have to be able to read where to cut the _Youki_,
<Toutousai:    naniyori, TEKI no YOUKI o ATTOUsuru TSUYOi KI ga nakerya DEKIru koto ja nee.>
Toutousai: and more than anything, without a strong enough energy to overwhelm the enemy's _Youki_, you can't do it.

2
[Inuyasha replies matter of factly.]
<Inuyasha:    he-, ore wa tada kinaKUSEe tokoro o KItte mita dake daga naa.>
Inuyasha: Hmm, I only tried to cut the place where it smelt incendiary.
<Toutousai:    koitsu...>
Toutousai: .oO(He what...?).

(    Inuyasha says he cut the place where it smelt 'kinakusee' (properly written
'kinakusai'), which I translated as 'incendiary'. Kinakusai is sort of like
'inflamable' but applies to explosions instead of fires. So Inuyasha
basically said "I only tried to cut the place where it smelt like it'd
cause an explosion".)

3
[Closeup side view of Toutousai, looking surprised.]
<Toutousai:    RIKUTSU o KOechimatte yagaru...>
Toutousai: .oO(He fucking surpassed the theory...).
<Toutousai:    soshite... RYUUKOSSEI no YOUKI o UWAMAWAru KI made itomo KANTAN ni...>
Toutousai: .oO(and... he even exceeded Ryuukossei's _Youki_ very easily...).

4
[View of Inuyasha looking rather confident, from Toutousai's point of view.]
<Toutousai:    INUYASHA no yatsu... OMOtta yori OOMONO na no kamo...>
Toutousai: .oO(Why that Inuyasha.... he might be greater than I thought...).



Page 14
1
[Miroku and Sango approach, and Inuyasha happily puts his hand to
Tetsusaiga's handle.]
<Miroku:    INUYASHA, tonikaku korede TETSUSAIGA de JIZAI ni AYATSUreru you ni natta n-da na.>
Miroku: Anyway Inuyasha, this means you can now control Tetsusaiga freely.
<Inuyasha:    soredokoro ja nee ze, MIte ODOROke.>
Inuyasha: That's not all - watch this!

2
[Inuyasha makes a powerful swing with Tetsusaiga, unleashing a load of energy.]
Fx Tetsusaiga: whoosh <Go_>



Page 15
1
[A bunch of rocks in front of Inuyasha are smashed apart, though it doesn't
appear to be as strong as the full Cutting Wind.]
Fx rocks: wham-am-am <Gagagaga>

2
[Sango and Miroku look on in surprise.]
<Sango:    a...>
Sango: Ah...
<Miroku:    KAZE no KIZU...>
Miroku: The Cutting Wind...

3
[Closeup of Inuyasha slinging Tetsusaiga over his shoulder, looking happy.]
<Inuyasha:    dou da,>
Inuyasha: What do you think,
<Inuyasha:    itsudemo KAZE no KIZU ga DAseru ze.>
Inuyasha: I can do the Cutting Wind any time.
Fx Tetsusaiga: hshht... <Shu--->

4
[Miroku has whacked Inuyasha on the head with his staff.]
<Miroku:    sonna ABUnai KATANA o, muyami ni FUriMAWAsu yatsu ga aru ka.>
Miroku: So you're the type to recklessly show off a dangerous sword eh.
Fx Inuyasha: {comically} clunk... <mishi...>
<Toutousai:    u-n, yappa mada Chinpira ka.>
Toutousai: Umm, still a hoodlum I guess.



Page 16
1
[Scene change to someone's view moving through some air with dark swirls.]
Fx air: whoosh <Go_>

2
[Kagura is on one of her large feathers, and she has a passange - an old
woman, with long white hair and black clothes.]
<old woman:    yareyare mata...>
old woman: It's _still_ going on...
<old woman:    NENIri na KEKKAI da ne.>
old woman: This is an elaborate barrier, isn't it.
<Kagura:    shikkari tsukamatte na, baa-san.>
Kagura: Hang on tight okay, baa-san.

3
[View of a castle below, also covered with dark wavey lines. There is only
blackness around the castle.]
Fx air: whoosh <Go--->

4
[View of Naraku near a window inside the castle. Near him are three tall
pots, glowing at the top.]



Page 17
1
[Kagura is now standing in the doorway, pointing to the old woman, who only
comes up to her waist. The old woman has quite an aged face, is quite
hunched, and is wearing a dark kimono.]
<Kagura:    NARAKU,>
Kagura: Naraku,
<Kagura:    SAGAshite kita yo.>
Kagura: I've brought her.

2
[Closeup of Naraku.]
<Naraku:    KIta ka...>
Naraku: So you came...
<Naraku:    KURO MIKO TSUBAKI. >
Naraku: Dark Miko Tsubaki.

(    'Tsubaki' means 'camellia' - a type of flower.)



Page 18
1
[View of Naraku and Tsubaki.]
<Naraku:    TSUBAKI, kisama...>
Naraku: Tsubaki, you...
<Naraku:    GOJUUNEN hodo MUKASHI, KIKYOU to iu MIKO to TATAKAtta OBOe ga aru darou.>
Naraku: remember that you fought a Miko called Kikyou about 50 years ago, don't you.
<Tsubaki:    fu_, TASHIka ni...>
Tsubaki: Humph, it certainly was...
<Tsubaki:    MUKASHI no koto da...>
Tsubaki: a long time ago...

2
[View of Tsubaki.]
<Naraku:    kisama wa KIKYOU ni YABUre, URAmi o IDAite SUGATA o KEshita to KIku ga...>
Naraku: {off} You were defeated by Kikyou, bear her a grudge, and erased your form, I heard, but...

3
[Closeup of Naraku with a smile.]
<Naraku:    Ikite ita to iu WAKE ka...>
Naraku: I heard you were actually still alive...
<Naraku:    sono you na SUGATA ni MI o yatsushite...>
Naraku: disguising your form like that...

4
[Closeup of Tsubaki with a smile.]
<Tsubaki:    hoo... anta WATASHI no SHOUTAI o SHItte iru no kae.>
Tsubaki: Ohh... you know about my real form, huh.
