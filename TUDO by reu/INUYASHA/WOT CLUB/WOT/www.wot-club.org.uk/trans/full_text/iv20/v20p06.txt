Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

[View of Kagome standing with her eyes glazed over, and a dark glow coming
from the bottom of her neck. She has her right hand vaguely raised near her
neck, and has a sort of sad expression. Behind her is a drawing of the
nearly complete Shikon no Tama, blackened by Naraku's evil.]
<Title:    Juso>
Title: Juso

(    This is the same usage of 'Juso' as in the previous chapter - basically a
nasty type of poison.)

[Closeup of Inuyasha looking surprised and shocked.]
<Inuyasha:    DAREka ga kagome o NOROtte iru da to!?>
Inuyasha: Somebody is putting a curse on Kagome!?

2
[Kaede responds calmly.]
<Kaede:    osoraku kore wa...>
Kaede: This is probably...
<Kaede:    KURO MIKO no shiwaza...>
Kaede: the work of a Dark Miko...
<Kaede:    IDO de kagome o KAnda no wa KURO MIKO no TSUKAiMA, SHIKIGAMI darou.>
Kaede: Kagome was likely bitten at the Well by a Dark Miko's familiar, a 'Shikigami'.

(    I've translated "tsukai-ma" (sort of literally "errand demon") as
"familiar", which is of course a semi-magical creature a wizard uses as a
sort of remote eyes and ears as well as doing some tasks. A "Shikigami"
("ceremonial spirit") is a creature summoned to perform certain tasks (like
a familiar) but is rather more ethereal. Meiko from the manga/TV series
"Ghost Sweeper Mikami" can summon 9 Shikigami, though she can't control them...)

3
[View of Kaede's room. Shippou and Kirara are next to Kagome, looking at
her, while everyone else is looking at Kaede.]
<Inuyasha:    KURO MIKO da to!?>
Inuyasha: A Dark Miko!?
<Kaede:    aa, INUYASHA...>
Kaede: Indeed, Inuyasha...
<Kaede:    omae mo SONZAI kurai wa SHItte orou.>
Kaede: You too have heard of them at least.

[Closeup side view of Kaede.]
<Kaede:    JUSO o SENMON ni UkeOu YOKOSHIMA na MIKO...>
Kaede: Miko of evil specialising in Juso, to contract...
<Kaede:    SHIKON no kakera ga KEGAreta no mo, soyatsu no CHIKARA da.>
Kaede: Making the Shikon fragments impure, is also due to her power.

2
[Closeup of Kagome. She has her eyes closed, and is sweating. There is still
a dark glow coming from her throat.]
Fx Kagome: *pulse of energy* <Dokun>

3
[Shippou is looking at Kagome worriedly, and Sango is sitting by, looking
off at the others in worry.]
<Shippou:    KANZEN ni KARADA no NAKA ni haitte shimatto-ru.>
Shippou: They've gone completely into her body.
<Sango:    kono mama ja, kakera no DOKU de SHInjimau kamo.>
Sango: At this rate, she may die from the fragments' poison.

<Miroku:    kono NOROi o TAtsu ni wa sore shika nai.>
Miroku: It's the only way to break this curse.
