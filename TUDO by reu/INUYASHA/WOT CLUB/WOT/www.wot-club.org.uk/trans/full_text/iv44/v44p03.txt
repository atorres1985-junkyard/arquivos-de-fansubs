Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

<Miroku:    YOUKAI ni OSOware, KIMO o NUSUmareta to iu HANASHI wa Uso desu na.>

Page 10

[Flashback view of the transformed townsfolk.]
<Yourei:    dakara MACHICHUU no YOUJUTSU o HODOKOshi,>
Yourei: Which is why I applied the spell to the whole town,
<Yourei:    MADOwasarezu YOUKAI o SAGAshi DAseru ka TAMEshita.>
Yourei: to see if you could find out the Youkai without being decieved.

2
[Closeup of the Sennin.]
<Yourei:    sore to DOUJI ni,>
Yourei: At the same time as that,
<Yourei:    omae ni wa JUUYOU na MONO o KARADA de OBOete morawaneba naranakatta.>

[View of Inuyasha, with Sango and Miroku behind him.]

Fx Yourei: *clunk...* <Mishi...>
<Yourei:    tsumari.>

Page 11

[Flashback of when Inuyasha was running about through the town, against a
dark background of swirling energy.]
<Yourei:    washi ga TSUKUtta AYAKASHI no SEKAI no NAKA de,>
Yourei: Inside the fake world I had created,
<Yourei:    INUYASHA, omae wa TSUNE ni washi no YOUKI o AbiTSUZUkeru koto to naru.>

2
[Kagome talks to the Sennin.]
<Kagome:    TETSUSAIGA o KUSARI de FUUIN shita no wa...>
Kagome: The sealing of Tetsusaiga with the chains was...
<Yourei:    KATANA o NUku DANKAI dewa nakatta kara da.>
Yourei: It wasn't the right time for him to draw the sword you see.

3
[Closeup of the Sennin.]
<Yourei:    mazu wa INUYASHA JISHIN ga HONMONO no YOUKI o KARADA de KANjiru HITSUYOU ga atta.>
Yourei: The first thing was for Inuyasha himself to be able to sense the real Youkai-energy with his body.
<Yourei:    mottomo,>
Yourei: Of course,

4
[Flashback drawing to Tetsusaiga being wrapped with chains, and crackling
with energy.]
<Yourei:    MURI ni HIkiNUitara KATANA ga Oreru you SHIKAkete oita n-daga...>
Yourei: I had set it up so that simply trying to force the sword out would break it...

5
[Closeup of Inuyasha thinking about the time he tried that.]
<Inuyasha:    sou ka! sore de ano TOKI...>
Inuyasha: .oO(I see! So that's why at the time...).
<Inuyasha:    TETSUSAIGA ga KEIKOKU o...>
Inuyasha: .oO(Tetsusaiga warned me...).



Page 12

[Flashback drawing to when Inuyasha was wrapping around by the snake-woman,
with several Youketsu around him.]
<Yourei:    KEKKA, INUYASHA wa SHIN no YOUKI no UZU...>
Yourei: {voice over} The result - Inuyasha discovered the insight...
<Yourei:    YOUKETSU o MIidasu ME o YASHINAtta.>
Yourei: to see the Youketsu, the true swirl of Youkai-energy.

2
[Flashback drawing to the bull-Oni.]
<Yourei:    soshite SAIGO no DANKAI ga...>
Yourei: {voice over} Then at the final stage....
<Yourei:    RYUURIN no TETSUSAIGA no TSUKAi KATA de atta.>
Yourei: it was learning how to use dragon-scale Tetsusaiga.

3
[View of Miroku, with Shippou on his shoulder.]
<Miroku:    TSUKAi KATA...>
Miroku: How to use...?
<Shippou:    IMA sara to iu KI mo suru ga.>
Shippou: That feels somewhat too late though.

4
[Closeup of the Sennin.]
<Yourei:    INUYASHA... omae wa,>
Yourei: Inuyasha... what kind of power,
<Yourei:    RYUURIN no TETSUSAIGA no CHIKARA o dou RIKAIshite ita?>
Yourei: do understand dragon-scale Tetsusaiga's to be?

5
[Closeup of Inuyasha looking a bit confused.]
<Inuyasha:    dou tte...>
Inuyasha: "What kind"...?

Page 13

[Closeup of Inuyasha.]
<Inuyasha:    YOUKI o SUu... KATANA.>
Inuyasha: A sword which... sucks Youkai-energy.

2
[FlashBack Flashback to Sesshoumaru from chapter 425.
<Sesshoumaru:    INUYASHA, kisama wa...>
Sesshoumaru: Inuyasha, you...
<Sesshoumaru:    TETSUSAIGA to iu KATANA marude wakatte inai.>
Sesshoumaru: don't seem to understand the sword known as Tetsusaiga at all.
EndFlashBack]

3
[View of the Sennin.]
<Yourei:    omae no TETSUSAIGA wa, KItta AITE no YOURYOUKU o TOrikomu KATANA da sou da na.>
Yourei: Your Tetsusaiga, does seem to be a sword which takes in the Youkai-power of the opponents you cut, I guess.
<Yourei:    sono UROKU no TOUSHIN no moto ni natta no ga, YOUKI o SUu KATANA datta n-darou.>
Yourei: The original scaled blade was like that - a sword that sucks Youkai-energy after all.

4
[View of Miroku and Sango.]
<Miroku:    TASHIka ni... RYUURIN no TETSUSAIGA wa YOUKI o SUu KATANA,>
Miroku: Certainly... dragon-scale Tetsusaiga is a sword that sucks Youkai-energy,
<Miroku:    YOUTOU DAKKI no YOURYOKU o TOrikonda mono desu ga.>
Miroku: because the Youkai-sword Dakki took in Youkai-power.
<Sango:    sore ga...?>
Sango: What of it...?

5
[Closeup of the Sennin, with a view of Toutousai in the background.]
<Yourei:    TOUTOUSAI kara no DENGON da...>

Page 14

[Closeup of the Sennin.]
<Yourei:    TETSUSAIGA wa aku made,>
Yourei: In the end, Tetsusaiga,
<Yourei:    KIru KATANA da to na.>
Yourei: is a sword that cuts.

2
[Closeup of Inuyasha looking a bit surprised.]
<Inuyasha:    KIru KATANA...>
Inuyasha: .oO(A sword that cuts...).

3
[Miroku, Sango and Kagome look a bit confused.]
<Miroku:    ...KIku to Atari MAE no KOTO no you desu ga.>
Miroku: ...That seems like a rather obvious thing to say though.
<Kagome:    demo... sore ga DEKIte nakatta tte koto na no ne.>
Kagome: But... I guess he's saying that Inuyasha hasn't been able to do that.

[Closeup of the Sennin.]
<Yourei:    hitotsu KIku.>
Yourei: I have one question.
<Yourei:    omae wa NAZE SAIGO no YOUKETSU o KItta?>
Yourei: Why did you cut that Youketsu at the end?

2
[Flashback drawing to when Inuyasha cut the Youketsu near the Sennin.]
<Yourei:    ano TOKI, soredemo MURI ni YOURYOUKU o SUttara...>
Yourei: At the time, if you had sucked any more Youkai-power needlessly...

3
[View of the Sennin, with Miroku, Shippou and Inuyasha looking on.]
<Yourei:    KATANA ga tatakiOreru SHIKAke ga shite atta n-daga.>

<Shippou:    WANA darake ja na.>
Shippou: There were traps everywhere.
Inuyasha: ......

4
[Closeup of Inuyasha.]
<Inuyasha:    TETSUSAIGA ni Hibi ga haitte ita kara...>
Inuyasha: Since Tetsusaiga had fractures...
<Inuyasha:    ICHIGEKI de KImeru shika nakatta.>
Inuyasha: I had to end it with one strike.

5
[View of the Sennin looking half frustrated, half happy.]
<Yourei:    nanda...>
Yourei: Oh...
<Yourei:    RIKUTSU ga wakatte-ta WAKE ja nai no ka.>
Yourei: so I guess it's not like you don't get it at all.



Page 16

[View of Inuyasha.]
<Yourei:    mottomo, sore ga DAIJI nan daga na,>
Yourei: .oO(Of course, that is the most important thing though -).
<Yourei:    KATANA to omae ga TSUUjiatte-ru tte koto ga.>
Yourei: .oO(for the sword and you to be able to understand each other.).

2
[Closeup of the Sennin.]

Yourei: That's all.
<Yourei:    SHUGYOU SHUURYOU...>
Yourei: The training is completed...

<Inuyasha:    e...>

4
[Inuyasha has pulled out dragon-scale Tetsusaiga and it seems to be surging
with energy.]

<Kagome:    a...>
Kagome: Ah...
<Shippou:    Hibi ga naotto-ru.>

Fx air: whoosh... <Go--->
<Inuyasha:    YOUKI o... Obite iru!?>
Inuyasha: It's... tinged with Youkai-energy!?

2
[Miroku turns to look at the Sennin.]
<Miroku:    ano YOUKI wa... moshiya YOUREI TAISEI-sama no?>
Miroku: That Youkai-energy... could it be yours, Yourei Taisei-sama?
<Yourei:    MURON.>
Yourei: Of course.
<Yourei:    washi no TSUKUtta YOUKETSU o KItta n-dakara na.>
Yourei: Since he cut the Youketsu I created after all.

3
[Closeup of the Sennin, smiling.]
<Yourei:    washi no YOUKI wa TSUYOi ze.>
Yourei: My Youkai-energy is _strong_.
<Yourei:    sokorahen no YOUKAI no YOUKETSU nanzo, mapputatsu da.>
Yourei: There's no comparison to the Youketsu of any normal Youkai.

Fx Inuyasha: pat pat <pita pita pita>
<Kagome:    arigatou gozai masu desho, INUYASHA.>
Kagome: I think you mean, "Thank you for everything", Inuyasha.
<Miroku:    IMA mo JUUBUN BUREI desu shi ne.>
Miroku: He sure has been rude enough, even now.

2
[View of the Sennin.]
<Yourei:    TAYOrinee HANYOU no KOZOU_KO da to OMOtte-ta ga...>
Yourei: .oO(I had thought he was just a useless Half-Youkai brat, but...).
<Yourei:    washi no SHUGYOU o yariNUichimatta.>
Yourei: .oO(he got through my training.).
