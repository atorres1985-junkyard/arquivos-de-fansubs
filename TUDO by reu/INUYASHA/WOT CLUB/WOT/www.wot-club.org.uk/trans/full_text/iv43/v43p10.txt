Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

<Title:    YOUKETSU>
Title: The Youketsu

(    "Youketsu" doesn't translate too well. The "you" is the same as in "youkai"
and may be short for "youki" (youkai-energy) in this case. The "ketsu" part
can mean "hole", "gap", "cave" and so on. "Hole of youkai-energy" perhaps.)
