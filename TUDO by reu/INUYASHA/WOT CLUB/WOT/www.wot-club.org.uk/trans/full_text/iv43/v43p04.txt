Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

crackling around his body.]

[View of Inuyasha.]
<Inuyasha:    MOURYOUMARU, temee...>
Inuyasha: Mouryoumaru, it looks like...
<Inuyasha:    yakkari na mon toriIrechimatta rashii na!>
Inuyasha: you really took in something awkward eh!

[View of Miroku, Kagome and Sango.]
<Miroku:    INUYASHA ga HONOO no TETSUSAIGA de KIritsukeru tabi ni,>
Miroku: Every time Inuyasha slashes him with the firey Tetsusaiga,
<Miroku:    MOURYOUMARU no TAINAI o IKAZUCHI ga SEme SAINAmu to iu koto ka.>
Miroku: it means Mouryoumaru is tortured from the inside by lighting.

2
[Closeup side view of Mouryoumaru thinking, with the two brothers shown in
the background.]
<Mouryoumaru:    yahari KINKA GINKA NIPIKI tomo KUubeki datta...>

[Continued side view of Mouryoumaru.]
<Mouryoumaru:    TETSUSAIGA no HONOO ga...>

<Mouryoumaru:    waga TAINAI de, KOROshita hazu no GINKA o YObisamasu...>
Mouryoumaru: .oO(call out to Ginka in side me, even though he should be dead...).

[Closeup side view of Inuyasha looking shocked.]
Inuyasha: !

2
[View of Miroku, Kagome and Sango.]
<Miroku:    NARAKU no SHINZOU...>
Miroku: Naraku's heart...
<Sango:    AKAGO!>
Sango: the baby!

3
[Closeup of the baby, looking very angry as energy crackles around him.]
Fx energy: crick crick <Bishi Bishi>

4
[Suddenly a huge amount of miasma comes out in front of Inuyasha.]
Fx miasma: bwoosh <Buwa_>
<Inuyasha:    SHOUKI!>
Inuyasha: Miasma!



Page 8

[A bunch of diamond spears are fired through the miasma.]
Fx spears: wham-wham <>

2
[Inuyasha dodges to the side and the spears hit the ground.]
Fx spears: thud thud <Doka Doka>
<Inuyasha:    ha_!>
Inuyasha: {dodging} Hah!

[Mouryoumaru flies up into the air surrounded by miasma.]
Fx air: whoosh <Go_>

[View of Inuyasha looking up angrily at this.]
Fx miasma: sizzle <Ju-...>
<Inuyasha:    ku_...>
Inuyasha: Ugh...!

[Closeup side view of Inuyasha.]
<Inuyasha:    chikushou...>
Inuyasha: Dammit...
<Inuyasha:    ato IPPO tte tokorode...>
Inuyasha: Probably one more step was all I needed...

2
[Inuyasha glances back at Kagome.]
<Kagome:    dakedo IMA made ni nakatta kota da wa.>
Kagome: However, that hadn't happened until now.
<Kagome:    SHINZOU ga mukiDAshi ni naru nante...>
Kagome: For the heart to actually be shown is...

3
[View of Miroku.]
<Miroku:    kou naru KOTO wa...>
Miroku: For things to end up like this...
<Miroku:    NARAKU no OMOWAKU o KOete ita no dewa nai ka?>
Miroku: Hasn't it surpassed Naraku's expectations?

4
[Closeup of Inuyasha.]
<Inuyasha:    NARAKU no OMOWAKU... ka...>
Inuyasha: Naraku's expectations... eh...

5
[View of Miroku, with a drawing of Nikosen behind him.]
<Miroku:    aa... SAISHO NARAKU wa,>
Miroku: Yeah... at the start,
<Miroku:    INUYASHA ni NIKOSEN o keshikaketa...>
Miroku: Naraku set Nikosen on Inuyasha...



Page 10
1
[Drawing of a glowing Tetsusaiga.]
<Miroku:    KEKKA, RYUURIN no TETSUSAIGA wa NIKOSEN no SENKI o JOUKAsare,>
Miroku: The result of that is Nikosen's energy purifies dragon-scale Tetsusaiga,
<Miroku:    INUYASHA o KURUshimete ita YOUKI no GYAKURYUU wa KAISHOUsareta...>
Miroku: and Inuyasha is relieved from suffering from the reverse-flow of Youkai-energy...

2
[Drawing of the two brothers.]
<Miroku:    sono IPPOU de, NARAKU wa MOURYOUMARU ni KINKA GINKA o KUwase,>
Miroku: At the same time, Naraku tried to get Mouryoumaru to eat Kinka and Ginka,
<Miroku:    GAIKOU o TSUYOku shiyou to shita...>
Miroku: to strengthen the armour-shell...

3
[The group is now sitting around a camp-fire.]
<Miroku:    osoraku NARAKU wa, RYOUSHA ni KIKKOUshita CHIKARA o ATAe,>
Miroku: Naraku was probably expecting the rivaling powers he gave them both,
<Miroku:    TAGAi ni KIZUtsuki, TAOreru no o MAttsu tsumori datta no deshou...>
Miroku: to result in them injuring each other, and collapsing - and he was waiting for that...

4
[Closeup of Kagome.]
<Kagome:    KINKA ga TETSUSAIGA ni DOUKAshita no wa,>
Kagome: Meaning that Kinka merging with Tetsusaiga,
<Kagome:    KEISANGAI datta tte koto ne.>
Kagome: was outside his calculations then, right?



Page 11
1
[Inuyasha looks at Tetsusaiga in its scabbard.]
<Inuyasha:    darou yo.>
Inuyasha: You bet.
<Inuyasha:    okage de TETSUSAIGA to GAIKOU wa DOUTOU dokoroka...>
Inuyasha: Thanks to that, Tetsusaiga and his armour-shell are now in a different class...

2
[View of Sango and Miroku.]
<Sango:    TETSUSAIGA de KIraretara GAIKOU no NAKA no AKAGO made ABUnai...>
Sango: With Tetsusaiga being able to cut the armour-shell, even the baby inside was in danger...
<Miroku:    kore wa NARAKU ni tottemo CHIMEITEKI na SHIPPAI datta hazu.>
Miroku: To Naraku that could well be a fatal mistake.

(    With the baby protected by the armour-shell, Naraku probably hoped for the
rest of Mouryoumaru to be damaged - meaning he could get the baby back.)

3
[View of Inuyasha, Kagome and Shippou.]
<Shippou:    dewa, MOURYOUMARU wa mohaya INUYASHA ni wa kanawanai to iu koto ka?>
Shippou: Then, this means Mouryoumaru can no longer compete with Inuyasha?
<Kagome:    sou iu koto yo ne.>
Kagome: That's true isn't it.
<Inuyasha:    ke_.>
Inuyasha: Bah!

4
[Closeup side view of Inuyasha.]
<Inuyasha:    MOURYOUMARU wa KARADA no KUmikae ga dekiru n-da ze.>
Inuyasha: Mouryoumaru can re-arrange his body.



Page 12
1
[Closeup of Sango thinking.]
<Sango:    sou da ne.>
Sango: That's true.
<Sango:    MOtte ite FURI ni naru to wakattte iru GINKA no KARADA...>
Sango: Now that having Ginka's body is a weakness...
<Sango:    sassa to SUtete shimau ni KImatte iru.>
Sango: he'll obviously get rid of it quickly.

2
[View of Miroku.]
<Miroku:    soredemo TETSUSAIGA ga YUURI na koto ni kawari wa nai deshou.>
Miroku: Even then, Tetsusaiga's advantage will still remain though.
<Miroku:    KEKKYOKU, MOURYOUMARU wa nanimo Enakatta koto ni naru.>
Miroku: So in the end, Mouryoumaru won't have gained anything.

3
[Closeup of Inuyasha looking a bit annoyed.]
<Inuyasha:    doo-mo KI ni kuwanee na...>
Inuyasha: I really don't like it though...

4
[Closeup of Kagome looking a bit surprised.]
<Kagome:    INUYASHA...?>
Kagome: Inuyasha...?

5
[Shippou comes over to taunt Inuyasha.]
<Shippou:    NARAKU no SAKURYAKU to wa ie, TETSUSAIGA ga TSUYOku natta n-ja.>
Shippou: Even if it was Naraku's plan, Tetsusaiga did get stronger.
<Shippou:    TANA kara Botamochi dewa nai ka.>
Shippou: Isn't that good news?
<Inuyasha:    dakara da yo!>
Inuyasha: That's the point!



Page 13
1
[Closeup side view of Inuyasha looking quietly serious.]
<Inuyasha:    NIKONSEN no SENKI mo...>
Inuyasha: Both Nikosen's energy...
<Inuyasha:    KINKA no HONOO mo...>
Inuyasha: and Kinka's flames...
<Inuyasha:    TATAKAtte KAchiTOtta wake ja nee.>
Inuyasha: weren't gained by me fighting for them.

2
[Inuyasha looks at Tetsusaiga.]
<Inuyasha:    dakara nanka, TETSUSAIGA ga KAriMONO mitai de,>
Inuyasha: So it somehow seems like Tetsusaiga borrowed them,
<Inuyasha:    shikkuri konee n-da.>
Inuyasha: and they're not well matched.

3
[Misty frame.]
<Inuyasha:    JIBUN no CHIKARA de nanika o tsukamitotte koso,>
Inuyasha: .oO(Precisely because I gained it by my own power,).
<Inuyasha:    RYUURIN no TETSUSAIGA wa HONTOU ni ore no mono ni naru hazu n-da.>
Inuyasha: .oO(it feels that dragon-scale Tetsusaiga belongs to me.).
