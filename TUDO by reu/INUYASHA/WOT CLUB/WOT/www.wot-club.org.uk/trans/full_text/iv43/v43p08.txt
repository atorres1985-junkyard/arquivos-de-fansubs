Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

<Toutousai:    YOUREI TAISEI wa YOUKAI no SENNIN mitee na yatsu yo.>

[View of Sango and Miroku.]
<Sango:    sore de SATO no HITO-tachi no SUGATA o YOUKAI ni kaete magirekonde iru to...?>
Sango: So that's why it has changed the villagers to have the form of Youkai then...?
<Miroku:    KI o KAKUsu nara MORI no NAKA to iu koto desu ka.>
Miroku: So it's thinking of "hiding a tree by putting it in a forest" eh.

3
