Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

[Kikyou stands carrying a bow, and there are several of the long, thin
Youkai she uses behind her.]
<Title:    KODOKU>
Title: Kodoku

(    This title is a name/term, though I can't figure it out...)

<Sango:    kono MIKO... kagome-chan ni NIte-ru...>
Sango: .oO(This miko... resembles Kagome-chan...).

(    'Miko' - female (Shinto) priestess. It's pretty easy to deduce that Kikyou
is one because she is dressed exactly like a traditional miko.)

3
[Kikyou just move past Kagome, to her surprise.]
Fx Kikyou: *glide past...* <Su...>
<Kagome:    a...>

[Kagome turns back while running into the cave.]
<Kagome:    SANGO-chan KOnai de.>
Kagome: Don't come in Sango-chan.
<Kagome:    JAKI de TAOrechau.>
Kagome: The evil will get you.
<Kagome:    SHIPPOU-chan, soba ni site agete!>
Kagome: Shippou-chan, stay beside her!

[Sango looks on in surprise.]
Sango: ......

[Sango turns to Kirara, who rushes off.]
<Sango:    KIRARA tsuite ike.>

[Closeup of Miroku, shouting down to Inuyasha.]

[Closeup of Miroku trying to drive the point home.]
<Miroku:    kore wa marude FUKO no JUTSU...
** 'fuko'?
>
Miroku: It is like the spell of 'Fuko'...
<Miroku:    KODOKU no TSUKUri KATA to ONAji nan-da.>
Miroku: It's the same way in which 'Kodoku' is made.

(    Can't figure out 'fuko' (really need a better dictionary than I have now,
which is pretty expensive itself) though it's probably some kind of control spell.)

<Miroku:    dakara yoshinba omae ga sono YOUKAI o TAOshita to shitemo...>
Miroku: That's why, even if you defeat that Youkai...

2
