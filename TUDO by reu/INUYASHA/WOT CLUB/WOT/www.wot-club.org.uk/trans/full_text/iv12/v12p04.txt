Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

too happy, while Kagome is leaning on Inuyasha slightly, looking off into
the distance happily.]

Title: Jinenji

(    Jinenji is a name, which somewhat loosely translates as 'earth-loving-child'.)

[Closeup of Kirara, asleep or unconscious.]
Fx Kirara: (painfully) me~w <Guni~>

2
[The view expands to show Kirara curled up next to Sango, who is lying on a
mat in a small room, with a blanket over her - actually her kimono/jacket.]
<Sango:    KIRARA...>
Sango: Kirara...
<Sango:    KURUshii no?>
Sango: Does it hurt?

3
[Flashback to when Kirara tried to take a bite out of Naraku.]
<Sango:    NARAKU no DOKU ga KARADA kara NUkete nai n-da...>
Sango: .oO(The poison from Naraku's body hasn't come out...).

4
[View of the sky.]
<Kagome:    DOKUkeshi no YAKUSOU!?>
Kagome: {off} Antidote herbs!?

(    Literally 'medicinal plants', not 'herbs', but that gets a bit cumbersome.)

5
[Kagome, Shippou, Inuyasha and Miroku are sitting outside an old wooden
building, presumably with Sango inside. Myouga is bouncing along Inuyasha's shoulder.]
<Kagome:    sore o TSUKAeba KIRARA wa NAOru no!? MYOUGA-jii-chan.>
Kagome: If we can use that, will it cure Kirara, Myouga-jii-chan!?
<Myouga:    umu.>
Myouga: Right.

1
[Closeup of Myouga.]
<Myouga:    tada, sono YAKUSOU no HATAKE wa YOUKAI ga MAMOtte iru rashikute na...>
Myouga: However, I heard the field of herbs is protected by a Youkai...
<Myouga:    KANTAN ni TE ni hairu ka dou ka...>
Myouga: Maybe they won't be so easy to get hold of...

2
[View of the old, worn looking building.]
<Sango:    sou...>
Sango: {off} I see...
<Sango:    INUYASHA-tachi ga YAKUSOU o tori ni...>
Sango: Inuyasha and the others, have gone to get the herbs...

3
[Inside the building, Miroku is sitting near Sango - though there isn't that
much space.]
<Miroku:    WATASHI wa omae no GOEI no tame ni NOKOri mashita.>
Miroku: I stayed behind to guard you.
<Miroku:    ANSHINshite oYASUminasai, SANGO.>
Miroku: Put your mind at rest and relax, Sango.

4
[Closeup of Sango looking off at Miroku.]
Fx Sango: *stare* <ji~>

5
[Closeup of Miroku, smiling.]
<Miroku:    ...nanika?>
Miroku: ...What is it?

6
[Sango has edged away from Miroku, who looks a bit put-upon.]
<Sango:    nanka... kaette ABUnai you na KI ga suru.
** What's this 'kaette'? "Until Inuyasha-tachi return..."?
>
Sango: Somehow... I feel like I'm in more danger.
<Miroku:    fu_.>
Miroku: *sigh*



Page 4

[Closeup of Shippou.]
Fx Shippou: *stare* <ji~>

2
[On the other side of Sango, is Shippou, staring intently.]
<Shippou:    ANSHINsei SANGO.>
Shippou: Don't worry Sango.
<Shippou:    MIROKU ga MYOU ga Mane o senuyou ni MIBAre to, kagome ni Iitsukattoru.>
Shippou: Kagome told me to keep my eyes out in case Miroku starts acting strange.
Fx Shippou: *stare* <ji~>
<Miroku:    fu--->
Miroku: *si-i-i-gh*

(    Kagome's order you could interpreted in two ways, and Shippou seems to have
interpreted the order to mean he should just watch, rather than to protect Sango.)

3
[Kagome is riding her bike over rough ground with Inuyasha sitting on the back.]
Fx bike: clatter <gatata>

4
[Inuyasha, who has a rather weary look, talks to Kagome.]
<Inuyasha:    ore hitori de Itta HOU ga HAYAi n-ja nee ka na.>
Inuyasha: I guess it would have been faster if I went by myself.
<Kagome:    nani yo IMA sara.>
Kagome: Why are you bringing this up now?

[Closeup of Jinenji - he's vaguely humanoid, though about 10 feet tall (and
would be taller if he stood up straight instead of hunching), has a thick
torso, has simple miss-matched clothes and big scars down his arms. His
head is the least human thing about him - though it's mostly hairless (he
has a tangled mess of black hair at the back), he has large bulbous black
eyes, with no eye-lids, and a mouth that looks a bit like a horse's. He is
carrying a bucket on a pole over his shoulder.]
