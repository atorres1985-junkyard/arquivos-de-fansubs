Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

[View of the hut belonging to Jinenji and his mother, with a drawing of
Inuyasha overlaid.]
Fx leaves: rustle... <Zaa...>
<old-mother:    INUYASHA... to ka itta na.>
old-mother: You're called... Inuyasha, right.

2
[View of the old woman, looking at Inuyasha hard.]
<old-mother:    MIta tokoro omae mo HANYOU daro.>
old-mother: Now that I look, you're Half-Youkai too, aren't you.

3
[Inuyasha, Kagome the old woman are inside the hut, along with Jinenji, who
is curled up, but still almost touches the roof.]
<Inuyasha:    wakaru no ka yo babaa.>
Inuyasha: You got that right, babaa.
Fx Jinenji: (breating) hshht <Shu-->
<old-mother:    yappari na...>
old-mother: I thought so...
<old-mother:    sore ni shicha kirei na KAO shitoru ga...>
old-mother: Because you might have a pretty face, but...

(    'babaa' is a rude way of saying 'obaa-san' (or obaa-chan), ie 'old woman'
or 'grandmother'.)

[Closeup of the old woman.]
<old-mother:    sono SUGATA, dou MItatte HANBAke dakara na.>
old-mother: your shape, however you look at it, it's half-transformed.

2
[Kagome tugs on Inuyasha dog-like ears, while Inuyasha looks annoyed.]
<Kagome:    HANBAke tte...>
Kagome: "Half-transformed"...
<Kagome:    kono hen no koto kashira ne.>
Kagome: You mean these things, right.
Fx ears: *tug tug* <kui kui>
<Inuyasha:    ke_.>
Inuyasha: Bah!

3
[Closeup of the old woman.]
<old-mother:    omae nara SOUZOU ga tsuku darou.
** sounds strange
>
old-mother: That would be a good guess with you.

4
[View of the old woman, with Jinenji beside her.]
Fx Jinenji: hshh... <Shu-...>
<old-mother:    kono JINENJI ga HANYOU datte iu dake de...>
old-mother: Just because Jinenji here is called "Half-Youkai"....
<old-mother:    ora-tachi OYAKO ga, MURA no yatsura ni donna ATSUKAi sarete kita ka...
**
>
old-mother: you can see how those villagers have come to treat us...

5
[Closeup of Kagome.]
<Kagome:    ano...>
Kagome: Umm...
<Kagome:    ijimerareteru n-desu ka?>
Kagome: Is he being picked on?

(    Kagome says this in the standard polite way in Japanese - she is speaking
properly for talking to a stranger, though she is the only one doing so.)

6
[Closeup of the old woman looking angry.]
<old-mother:    fun...>
old-mother: Humph...
<old-mother:    NANDO KOsaresou ni natta koto ka.>
old-mother: More like they seemed to be trying to kill him several times.

[Closeup of Jinenji.]
<Jinenji:    gomen okkaa.>
Jinenji: Sorry, Ma.
<Jinenji:    ora no sei de ijimerareru n-da na.>
Jinenji: It's my fault you get picked on.
Fx Jinenji: hshht <Haa-->

2
[The old woman looks up at her son with sad eyes.]
<old-mother:    nani o Iu JINENJI.>
old-mother: What are you saying Jinenji.
<old-mother:    ora-tachi wa nanimo MACHIGAttenee zo.
** lit "we haven't made any mistakes"?
>
old-mother: We haven't done anything wrong.

3
[Closeup of the old woman looking up at her son.]
<old-mother:    omae no oyaji-dono wa na,>
old-mother: Your oyaji-dono was,
<old-mother:    sore wa RIPPA na YOi YOUKAI datta n-da zo.>
old-mother: such a magnificent and kind Youkai.

(    Both Jinenji and his mother have a rather strong, and coarse regional
dialect. 'oyaji' is a coarse way of saying 'father' (Inuyasha uses 'oyaji'
when talking about his own father), though the '-dono' is a rather polite suffix.))

[Kagome leans forward.]

5
[The old woman starts talking, eyes closed, with a slight smile.]
<old-mother:    natsukashii nou.>
old-mother: How nostalgic.

old-mother: {voice over} A time when I was in difficulty with a sprained ankle on the mountain,
<old-mother:    TASUkete kureta no ga oyaji-dono datta.>
old-mother: and it was your oyaji-dono who saved me.

2
[The man comes towards the young woman, and is holding her ankle.]
<old-mother:    UTSUKUshii OTOKO no SUGATA o shite ita ga, sugu ni YOUKAI to wakatta.>
old-mother: {voice over} He had the appearance of a beautiful man, but I soon realised he was a Youkai.
<old-mother:    nanishiro HIKAri KAGAYAite otta kara na.>
old-mother: The glowing light around him gave it away.

<old-mother:    nanda to OMOtto-tta n-jai.>

<Kagome:    YAMANBA ja nakatta n-da...>
Kagome: She's not a mountain-witch then...
Fx Kagome: (heart) thump-thump <doki doki doki>

standing next to him.]

Kagome: The village people seem convinced that Jinenji-san is eating people.
<Kagome:    demo...>
