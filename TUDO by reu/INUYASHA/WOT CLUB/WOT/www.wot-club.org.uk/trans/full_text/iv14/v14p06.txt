Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

[Inuyasha is leaning angrily forward with Kagome, behind him, looking at him
in concern. Behind them in the air are some strange looking Youkai - they
have a humanoid upper body, but with blue skin, pointed ears, no hair and
bird-like claws for hands. Their lower body is a large round head (with
another pair of eyes, and a large wide toothy mouth) and a big pair of
wings. ]

[Kagome is being carried off by a grinning Kouga, and are both looking back.]
<Kagome:    INUYASHA----_!>
Kagome: Inuyasha-a-a-a!

2
[Meanwhile Inuyasha (who can't see what happened to Kagome) seems to have
tumbled down a cliff, along with some of Kouga's wolves, who are dead or unconscious.]
Fx rock: clatter <Gara...>
<Inuyasha:    ku_...>
Inuyasha: Ugh...

3
[Closeup of Inuyasha looking angry and worried.]
<Inuyasha:    kagome...>
Inuyasha: .oO(Kagome...).

[Miroku is making his way down the steep cliff-face, looking down at Inuyasha.]
Fx Miroku: shh <Za_>
<Miroku:    INUYASHA BUJI ka.>
Miroku: You okay, Inuyasha?
<Inuyasha:    MIROKU...>
Inuyasha: Miroku...

2
[Closeup of Inuyasha getting more worried.]
<Miroku:    KOUGA no MOKUTEKI wa kagome-SAMA dake datta you desu na.>
Miroku: {off} It seems that Kouga only goal was [to capture] Kagome-sama.

3
[View of the cliff-face.]
<Miroku:    sore ga SHOUKO ni, are dake ita OOKAMI-tachi ga...>
Miroku: As proof of that, the only wolves that were here...
** are dake ita...?

<Miroku:    atto iu MA ni TAIKYAKUshita.>
Miroku: have already retreated.

4
[View of the blue sky.]

5
[Kirara, in large form, is biting on some large feathers.]
Fx Kirara: *growl-growl* <Gau Gau>

6
[Miroku and Inuyasha come over to where Sango is.]
Fx Miroku: shh <Za_>
<Miroku:    SANGO!>
Miroku: Sango!
<Miroku:    kagome-SAMA wa...>

<Sango:    a...>
Sango: Ah...

[Sango looks somewhat annoyed.]
<Sango:    gomen...>
Sango: Sorry...
<Sango:    koitsu-ra ni TEkozutte-ru AIDA ni...>
Sango: While I was stuck fighting this lot...

2
[Closeup of Miroku looking surprised.]
<Miroku:    na...>
Miroku: Wha...

3
[View of some of dead birds with human torsos.]
<Miroku:    nanda kore wa...>
Miroku: {off} What are these things...?
<Miroku:    TORI!?>
Miroku: Birds!?

4
[View of a large waterfall.]
Fx waterfall: *pound-pound-pound* <Dodododo>

5
[In a cave behind the watefall (I think) are Kagome and Shippou with a few
wolves sitting guard on them.]
Fx wolf: grr... <Ruru...>

6
[Closeup of Kagome, who looks a bit worried but composed, and Shippou
standing protectively in front of Kagome, looking very worried. (Shippou
was taken earlier)]

Kagome: .oO({off} Those Youkai-birds...).
<Kagome:    GOKURAKUCHOU no NAKA ni aru to iu SHIKON no kakera o MItsukeru made wa...>
Kagome: .oO(While I find Shikon fragments in those Gokuraku-chou...).

(    I think Kagome is referring to something Kouga said. Gokuraku-chou is the
same of these Youkai-birds, which literally translates as "paradise-birds".)

2
[Closeup of Kagome looking serious.]
<Kagome:    KOROsare wa shinai demo...>
Kagome: .oO(he won't kill me, but...).

<Kagome:    TORI no SU o OSOi ni SATO ni DEta TOKI ga...>
Kagome: .oO(When we go outside to attack the nest...).
<Kagome:    NIgeDAsu Chansu.>
Kagome: .oO(I'll have a chance to escape.).

4
[Kagome looks up as someone walks in - can just see one leg, from which a
glow is coming, so it's probably Kouga.]
Fx Kouga: shh <Za_>
Fx light: *glow* <Pou>



Page 6
1
[Kouga brings in a dead boar over his shoulder with a grin. Behind him are
some other members of the Youkai-wolf tribe. The cave also has a lot of
human skulls.]
Fx Kouga: shh <Za_>
<Kouga:    HI ga KUretara DEKAkeru zo.>
Kouga: As the day ends, we'll be leaving.

2
[Kouga puts down the boar in front of Kagome, and Shippou ducks behind
Kagome in fright.]
<Kouga:    HARAgoshirae shitoki na.>
Kouga: Have some food.
Fx boar: thud <Den>
Kagome: ......
Fx Shippou: *hide* <koso_>

3
[Looking apologetic, Kagome holds up a hand to say no.]
<Kagome:    gomen... SHOKUYOKUnai.>
Kagome: Sorry... I lost my appetite.
<Kagome:    Nama da shi...>
Kagome: .oO(It's raw and...).

[Kouga is staring of Kagome in a rather obvious way, and Kagome notices.]
<Kouga:    fu-n.>

Kouga: Now that I take a good look at you, you've got a cute face.

2
[Kagome is a bit taken aback.]
Kagome: ......
<Kagome:    haa?>
Kagome: Haah?



Page 8
1
[Kouga leans forwards, pointing at himself, and Kagome is even more shocked.]
<Kouga:    yoshi KImeta.>
Kouga: Okay then.
<Kouga:    omae ore no ONNA ni nare.>
Kouga: You be my woman.
<Kagome:    haaa?>
Kagome: Haaah?

2
[Some of Kouga's friends walk up in surprise, and Kagome ducks behind Kouga
in fright ^-^]
<wolf-man#1:    ko, KOUGA.>
wolf-man#1: Ko, Kouga...
<wolf-man#1:    YOU ga SUndara sono ONNA KUu n-ja nee no ka?>
wolf-man#1: You aren't going to eat her when you've finished with her?
<wolf-man#2:    daitai NINGEN no ONNA daro- ga yo, soitsu.>
wolf-man#2: In the first place, that's a human girl you got there.
Fx Kagome: (comically) *duck behind* <sasa_>

3
[Kouga looks at his friends with a grin.]
<Kouga:    ba-ka, sono ONNA wa SHIKON no kakera ga MIeru n-da zo.>
Kouga: Moron, this girl can see Shikon fragments.
<Kouga:    sokora e n-no YOUKAI ONNA yori yoppodo YAKU ni TAtsu ze.
** referring to some specific ones here?
>
Kouga: She's far more useful than those female Youkai.

4
[The others get the idea.]
<wolf-man#1:    e... sore ja,>
wolf-man#1: Oh... then...
<wolf-man#2:    SHIKON no kakera ga ZENBU ATSUmaru tte koto ka!?>
wolf-man#2: you're going to collect all the Shikon fragments!?

5
[Closeup of Kouga grinning.]
<Kouga:    sou sa.>
Kouga: You bet.
<Kouga:    sou surya ore-tachi no MUre wa MUTEKI da ze.>

[Kouga hoists up Kagome with a hand behind her back.]
<Kouga:    sou iu kotta.>

Kouga: You understand, right?
Fx Kouga: (Kagome) *pull towards* <gui>
<Kagome:    cho_...>
Kagome: Just a...

2
[Suddenly angry, Kagome throws a massive slap.]
<Kagome:    sawanai de yo Baka!>
Kagome: Don't touch me you idiot!
Fx Kagome: *sla-a-ap* <bucho-n>

3
[Kouga edges back with a large mark on his face and his friends stare in shock.]
Fx wolf-men: *stunned silence* <doyo_ ** guess>

[Kagome realises what she did, while Kouga is looking at her with a
thoughtfull expression.]
<Kagome:    a...>
Kagome: Ah...

5
[View of the wolf-men.]
<wolf-men:    KOUGA o NAGUtta.>
wolf-men: She hit Kouga.
<wolf-men:    a, ano ONNA KOROsare_ zo.>
wolf-men: Th, that girl's gonna die.
Fx wolf-men: *chatter-chatter* <zawa zawa zawa>

6
[Looking a bit angry, Kagome starts to explain.]

Kagome: Sorry but...



Page 10

<Kagome:    atashi ni wa, tsu_...>
Kagome: I am, se-...
<Kagome:    tsukiatte-ru HITO ga...>
Kagome: seeing someone...

(    As in "going out with", "dating" etc. I didn't think this slang existed 500
years ago...)

2
[Kouga looks at Kagome, who has a little sweat-drop.]
Kouga: ......
Kagome: ......

3
[Closeup of Kouga.]
<Kouga:    masaka ano...>
Kouga: You don't mean...
<Kouga:    INU_koro ka.>
Kouga: that dog-turd, huh.

4
[Kagome looks up angrily.]
<Kagome:    INUYASHA yo.>
Kagome: He's Inuyasha.
<Kagome:    INU_koro nante Iwanai de_.>
Kagome: Don't you dare call him dog-turd!

5
[Kouga edges towards Kagome again who backs away.]
<Kouga:    he~~~~~>
Kouga: Hm~m~m~m~m
Fx Kouga: *stare stare stare* <jiro jiro jiro>

6
[Kouga is still blushing a bit, and looking annoyed with herself.]
<Kagome:    sorya- tsukiatte-ru tte ittemo...>
Kagome: .oO(Though, I might have said I was seeing him, but...).
<Kagome:    Kisu-shita koto mo nai kedo-.>
Kagome: .oO(we haven't even kissed.).

(    Kagome knows she's exagerrating a bit and is annoyed with having to say
such things, though this is not the first time she's admitted to herself
that she and Inuyasha have a relationship of some kind. However, she also
seems to annoyed that despite her relationship with Inuyasha, they haven't kissed...)
