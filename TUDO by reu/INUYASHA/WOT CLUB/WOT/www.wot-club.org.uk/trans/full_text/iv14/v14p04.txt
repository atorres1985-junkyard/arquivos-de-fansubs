Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

[Inuyasha stands in front of the rest of the group, looking over at Kouga angrily.]
<Inuyasha:    temee ga HITOKUi OOKAMI no OYADAMA kai.>
Inuyasha: So you're the boss of the man-eating wolves.

[Kouga responds back angrily, with his wolves all around him.]
<Kouga:    sore ga doushita.>
Kouga: What of it.

2
[Closeup of Kouga looking angry.]
<Kouga:    ore no kawaii OOKAMI-tachi o KOROshi yagatte.>
Kouga: You fucking killed my dear wolves.
<Kouga:    YURUsanee zo temee-ra!>
Kouga: I won't forgive you bastards!

[Inuyasha responds angrily.]
<Inuyasha:    yakamashii! HITO no CHI no NIOi punpun sase yagatte.>
Inuyasha: Shut up! You fucking stink of human blood.
<Inuyasha:    ittai NANNIN KOROshi yagatta.>
Inuyasha: How fucking many did you kill.

2
[Kouga responds back angrily.]
<Kouga:    MESHI KUwaseta dake da, MONKU are ka kono INUkkoro.>
Kouga: Just eating dinner - you got a problem with that, you dog-turd.

(    Actually, I'm not entirely sure what Kouga means by 'inukkoro'...)

3
[Inuyasha is quite taken aback by this, while Miroku whispers to Sango.]
<Inuyasha:    na"_...>
Inuyasha: _Wha_...
<Miroku:    INUkkoro desu to.>
Miroku: "Dog-turd" he said.
<Sango:    wakaru no ka.
** erm... don't get this exchange.
>
Sango: Did you get it?

4
[Kouga spits to the side, dismissively.]
<Kouga:    ore wa INU no NIOi ga DAI_KIRAi nan-da.>
Kouga: I can't stand the smell of dogs.
<Kouga:    MUNAkuso WARUi ze.>
Kouga: It's giving me a bloody headache.
Fx Kouga: (spitting) peh! <Pe_>

5
[Inuyasha charges forwards, starting to draw Tetsusaiga.]
<Inuyasha:    omoshiree.>
Inuyasha: Cool.
<Inuyasha:    dattara sono MUNE mapputatsuni shite, KAZETOOshi yoku shite yarou ja nee ka!>
Inuyasha: Okay then, if I rip off your head, it won't hurt any more will it!
Fx Tetsusaiga: shing <Sha_>

(    A very literal translation of Kouga's line would be more like "It hurts my
chest terribly", meaning that he finds Inuyasha very annoying/disgusting
etc. A literal translation of Inuyasha's reply would be like "Okay then, if
I rip your chest in two, you'll be able to breathe better won't you.")

2
[Miroku looks to Sango.]
<Miroku:    YOUROUZOKU...?>
Miroku: Youkai-Wolf Tribe...?
<Miroku:    SHItte imasu ka SANGO.>
Miroku: Do you know them, Sango?
<Sango:    TAIJIYA no NAKAMA kara KItta koto ga aru.>
Sango: I've heard of them from my fellow Exterminators.

[Closeup of Sango.]
<Sango:    OOKAMI o AYATSUru YOUKAI de...>
Sango: They're Youkai who control wolves...
<Sango:    HITO no SUGATA ni BAkechairu kedo, HONSHOU wa OOKAMI to ONAji ARAppoi RENCHUU da tte...>
Sango: and take the form of people, but they're just as rough as real wolves...

[Closeup of Inuyasha looking angry, and has a mark on his right cheek where
he was kicked.]
<Inuyasha:    baka_!>
Inuyasha: Idiot!
<Inuyasha:    nande sore o HAYAku Iwanee.>
Inuyasha: Why didn't you say that earlier.

2
[Kagome looks a bit annoyed and frustrated.]
<Kagome:    da... datte...>
Kagome: Be... because...

(    Because she didn't get a chance...)

3
[Inuyasha sits up and looks over at Kouga.]
<Inuyasha:    ke_,>
Inuyasha: Bah!
<Inuyasha:    yatara TAIDO ga dekai kara, dore dake TSUee ka to OMOttara...
** kinda confusing this
>
Inuyasha: I was wondering just how strong you are given that overblown attitude...

4
[Closeup of Inuyasha shouting angrily.]
<Inuyasha:    SHIKON no kakera no CHIKARA o KArite kono TEIDO kai.>
Inuyasha: but is that the best you can do after borrowing the Shikon fragments' power?
<Inuyasha:    taishita koto nee naa, kono Kuzu YAROU.>
Inuyasha: You're nothing special, you useless twerp.

5
[Kouga responds angrily.]
<Kouga:    he_, hikkuriKAEri-nagara Kyankyan HOete n-ja nee yo.>
Kouga: Heh! Don't come barking to me while you're losing.
<Kouga:    kono INUkkoro ga!>
Kouga: You dog-turd!

6
[The rest look on at this shouting match - Kagome and Sango have rather
funny looking expressions.]
<Kagome:    ...KUCHI wa samu Suki ga nai ja nai.>
Kagome: ...I can't get a word in edgeways.
<Miroku:    u-mu, RYOUMEI tomo Gara ga WARUi desu naa.>
Miroku: Indeed, both of them are rather coarse, aren't they.
<Shippou:    HITO no koto wa Ien jaro-.>
Shippou: You can't say that to them.

(    Shippou means that since Miroku 'real' attitude is rather course too, he
doesn't have the right to preach to others about it.)
