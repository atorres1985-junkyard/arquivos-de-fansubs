Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

gone over to Inuyasha.]
<Toutousai:    he_, na-ni ga SHIN no KENATSU jai.>

Toutousai: I praise you for figuring out the "Cutting Wind."
<Toutousai:    DOKU de ME o fusagarete KURUshimagiredatta ni se yo...na.>
Toutousai: But it was because of the poison's pain and misting up of your eyes... wasn't it.



Page 9

[View of Kagome and Inuyasha.]
<Toutousai:    daga INUYASHA, omae...>
Toutousai: {off} However Inuyasha, you...
<Toutousai:    TETSUSAIGA o furikiranakatta darou.>
Toutousai: didn't swing Tetsusaiga as hard as your could, did you.
Inuyasha: !

<Toutousai:    ANI o KOROsu hodo REIKOKU ni narikirenakatta to iu tokoro ka.>
Toutousai: {off} You couldn't bring yourself to be ruthless enough to kill your brother, so to speak.

4
[Kagome looks up at Inuyasha with a gentle look. Inuyasha has an expression
like he won't admit something, or has only just realised something.]
<Kagome:    INUYASHA...>
Kagome: .oO(Inuyasha...).
Inuyasha: ......



Page 10

[Inuyasha is now acting like he wants to punch Toutousai, looking quite
angry, and is being held back by Kagome.]
<Inuyasha:    ke_, fuzakennna kuso jijii!>
Inuyasha: Bah, don't mock me, you old-geazer!
<Inuyasha:    DOKU de KARADA ga shibirete furikirenakatta dake dei_!>
Inuyasha: It's only because of the numbing poison that I couldn't swing it to the max!
<Shippou:    GENKI IPPAI dewa nai ka?>
Shippou: Still got lots of fight in him, hasn't he?
<Miroku:    nee.>
Miroku: Yeah.

2
[Toutousai holds out a hand to Inuyasha.]
<Toutousai:    sate INUYASHA,>
Toutousai: Now then Inuyasha,
<Toutousai:    TETSUSAIGA o yokose.>
Toutousai: hand over Tetsusaiga.
<Inuyasha:    na_...>
Inuyasha: Wha...

[Closeup of Toutousai.]
<Toutousai:    TOginaoshite yarou to Itto-ru n-ja.>

[View of the sky.]
<Miroku:    tsumari TOUTOUSAI-sama...>
Miroku: {off} In other words Toutousai-sama...

2
[The group is now beside a large river, the band of which is covered by
large flat rocks. By the river, Inuyasha is splashing some water onto his
face (to get rid of the poison presumably) with Kagome sitting next to him.
Sango and Miroku are looking at Toutousai who has Tetusaiga (powered up)
lying on a large flat rock and is blowing flames onto it and hitting it
with his long hammer.]
Fx Inuyasha: (water) splash <Basha>
<Miroku:    INUYASHA o TETSUSAIGA no SHIN no TSUKAiTE to oMITOme ni natta no de?>
Miroku: you now accept Inuyasha as Tetsusaiga's true master.
<Toutousai:    ma-na.>

Fx Toutousai: (flames) roa-a-ar... <Go----...>
Fx hammer: cla-a-ang <Ka---n>

[View of Toutousai, smoke coming from his mouth, looking up at the sky.]
<Toutousai:    nanishiro TETSUSAIGA wa, HYAPPKI no YOUKAI o NAgiHARAu ABUne- KATANA dakara na.>
Toutousai: At any rate, Tetsusaiga is a dangerous sword that can mow down 100 Youkai after all.

4
[Continuation of previous frame.]
<Toutousai:    INUYASHA kurai AMAcchoroi yatsu denakya TEWATAsene- no yo.
** amacchoroi?
>
Toutousai: If it wasn't someone as soft as Inuyasha, I wouldn't let them have it.

5
[Inuyasha looks over with a bit of a snear, wiping water from his face.]
<Inuyasha:    ke_.>
Inuyasha: Bah!



Page 12
1
[Closeup side view of Toutousai.]
<Toutousai:    moshi ano TOKI INUYASHA ga SESSHOUMARU o KOROsuKI de KATANA o furikitte itara...>
Toutousai: .oO(If at that time, Inuyasha intended to kill Sesshoumaru and swung with his full power...).

2
[Closeup of Inuyasha, still with scars on his face from Sesshoumaru.]
<Toutousai:    washi wa TETSUSAIGA o tatakiOru tsumori de atta.>
Toutousai: .oO({off} I would have smashed apart Tetsusaiga.).



Page 13
1
[View of Sesshoumaru.]
<Miroku:    SESSHOUMARU no gotoki REIKOKU na OTOKO wa,>
Miroku: {off} If even a ruthless man such as Sesshoumaru,
<Miroku:    tatoe "KAZE no KIZU" ga yometa tokoro de...>
Miroku: is able to read the "Cutting Wind"...

2
[Miroku is looking over at Inuyasha, who is wiping his face with a towel,
probably from Kagome.]
<Miroku:    sore ga wakaran.>
Miroku: there's one thing I don't get.
<Miroku:    naze SESSHOUMARU wa yasuyasu to "KAZE no KIZU" o...>
Miroku: How can Sesshoumaru read the "Cutting Wind" so easily...?
<Inuyasha:    KANTAN na kotta.>
Inuyasha: That's easy.
<Inuyasha:    aitsu Itte-ta ro.>
Inuyasha: It's like he said.

3
[FlashBack Flashback to the battle.
<Sesshoumaru:    HANYOU no kisama to WATASHI dewa...>
Sesshoumaru: As a Half-Youkai, compared to me...
<Sesshoumaru:    motomoto DEKI ga CHIGAu no da.>
Sesshoumaru: you never where any good.
EndFlashBack]

4
[Inuyasha fingers his nose, and Kagome gives him a surprised look.]
<Inuyasha:    HANA ga KIku n-da yo, aitsu no HOU ga.>
Inuyasha: It's his sense of smell - his is better.
<Kagome:    e"...>
Kagome: _Eh_...



Page 14
1
[Toutousai has gone back to working on Tetsusaiga, while Shippou, Sango and
Miroku have huddled together to chat, and Inuyasha looks angry.]
Fx Toutousai: (flames) roar... <Bo---....>
<Shippou:    SESSHOUMARU no HOU ga INU ni CHIGAi to yu- koto ka!?>
Shippou: Does that mean Sesshoumaru is closer to being a dog!?
Fx Shippou, Sango and Miroku: (loudly) *whisper whisper whisper* <hiso hiso hiso>
<Sango:    maa... HONTOU no YOUKAI nara nee.>
Sango: Well... he is a real Youkai after all.
<Miroku:    MIkake ja HANDAN dekinai mon desu na-.>
Miroku: I guess you can't always judge by apperances.
<Inuyasha:    do-yu- IMI dei.>
Inuyasha: What's that mean eh!?

(    Meaning that Inuyasha _looks_ more like a dog compared to Sesshoumaru, but
dog-like abilities aren't so good. Of course, those 3 haven't seen
Sesshoumaru's dog-form.)

2
[Closeup of Kagome.]
<Kagome:    demo ojii-san.>
Kagome: By the way ojii-san.
<Kagome:    SESSHOUMARU no KATANA TENSEIGA tte...>
Kagome: Sesshoumaru has that sword called Tenseiga...

3
[View of Toutousai.]
<Kagome:    HITO o SUKUu Iyashi no KATANA da tte...>
Kagome: {off} You said it's a healing sword that...
<Kagome:    Itte-ta wa yo ne.>
Kagome: saves people, didn't you.

4
[Closeup of Kagome.]
<Kagome:    TENSEIGA datte, YASAshii KOKORO ga nakucha MOtenai hazu ja nai?>
Kagome: To hold Tenseiga, wouldn't you need a kind heart?

5
[Toutousai looks at Kagome.]
<Toutousai:    ja yo na-.>
Toutousai: So it is.
<Toutousai:    sono hen ga washi ni mo Sappari...>
Toutousai: Even I don't have the slightest...
<Kagome:    wakannai no?>
Kagome: clue?



Page 15
1
[Toutousai thinks to himself.]
<Toutousai:    shikashi na-, TENSEIGA wa KEKKAI de KOBAmu dokoro ka,>
Toutousai: However, it's not like he's been refused by Tenseiga's warding,
<Toutousai:    TETSUSAIGA no KENATSU kara SESSHOUMARU o MAMOri otta.>
Toutousai: and it did protect Sesshoumaru from Tetsusaiga's blast.

2
[Drawing of the time when Sesshoumaru was being flung back, with light
shining out from around Tenseiga.]

3
[Kagome seems a bit surprised.]
<Kagome:    ano HIKARI...>
Kagome: .oO(That light...).
<Kagome:    TENSEIGA no!?>
Kagome: .oO(was Tenseiga's!?).

4
[View of the sky.]
<Toutousai:    sore wa torimo naosazu...
** not sure how definite this is...
>
Toutousai: {off} That definately means...

5
[More sky.]
<Toutousai:    TENSEIGA ga SESSHOUMARU o TSUKAiTE to shite ERAnda to iu koto.>
Toutousai: that Tenseiga has chosen Sesshoumaru as it's master.

[View of a hill.]
<Toutousai:    TENSEIGA o Ikasu mo KOROsu mo...
** this really doesn't make much sense. (if it was 'tenseiga de...' then maybe)
>
Toutousai: .oO({off} Whether I revive or kill Tenseiga...).

2
[View of some tree's in a forest.]
Fx leaves: rustle... <Zawa...>

3
[Sesshoumaru is lying back in some thick, tall grass in a small clearing in
the woods. There are several patches of blood over him.]
Fx Sesshoumaru: *strained breathing* <Shu--- Shu-->
<Toutousai:    SESSHOUMARU no KORODO shidai.>
Toutousai: .oO({off} is up to Sesshoumaru's heart.).



Page 17
1
[Closeup of Sesshoumaru. His eyes are open and his face is lying to the
side. His face still looks like near the end of the fight when his eyes
darkened and the dark lines of the side of his face are thicker and longer.
He is sweating a bit and basically looks in quite a bad way.]
Fx Sesshoumaru: *strained breathing* <Shu-->

2

bamboo pipe. This seems to be from Sesshoumaru's point of view, looking up
at her.]

2
[Closeup of Sesshoumaru.]
<Sesshoumaru:    KOdomo...?>
Sesshoumaru: .oO(A child...?).

[Wide angle view of the scene, with the little girl standing over
Sesshoumaru, who is looking the other way.]

<Sesshoumaru:    WATASHI o SUKUou to shite iru no ka.>
Sesshoumaru: .oO(intends to rescue me, huh.).
