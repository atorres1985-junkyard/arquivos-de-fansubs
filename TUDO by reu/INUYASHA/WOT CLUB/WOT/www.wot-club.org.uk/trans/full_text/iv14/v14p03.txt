Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

[Jaken moves over to Rin.]
<Jaken:    aa,>

[Drawing with Sesshoumaru holding Tenseiga, and Rin lying on the ground. The
background is all hazy and 4 small, spindly imps (or something) are
watching Rin, and they all have some kind of simple pole-arm weapon.]
<Sesshoumaru:    MIeru...>
Sesshoumaru: .oO(I can see them...).
<Sesshoumaru:    koyatsu-ra ano YO kara no TSUKAi ka-->
Sesshoumaru: .oO(So these are the pall-bearers from the next world.).

(    Rather hard to translate this. The word for 'pall-bearers' here is 'tsukai'
and normally means something like messenger. The meaning, I think, is that
these creatures are from the next world (ie Afterlife), who come to deliver
the souls of the dead or something.)

2
[Closeup of Sesshoumaru.]
<Sesshoumaru:    TAMEshite miru ka--->
Sesshoumaru: .oO(Let's test out...).

<Jaken:    nani o KItta n-da!?>
Jaken: .oO(What did he cut!?).

3
[Jaken looks on in confusion, and Sesshoumaru is picking up Rin with his one arm.]
<Jaken:    SESSHOUMARU-sama...?>
Jaken: Sesshoumaru-sama...?
Fx Rin: *slide...* <Zu...>



Page 10

[Closeup of Rin, in Sesshoumaru's arm.]
Fx Rin: (heart) *pulse...* <Tokun...>

2
[Closeup side view of Sesshoumaru.]

[Closeup of Rin, who now has both eyes open. She still have blood and dirt
over her, but all her wounds seem to have gone.]

Fx Rin: *taking a breath...* <ha--... **guess - ie she's starting to breath again>



Page 11

[Jaken in surprised.]
<Jaken:    e"...>
Jaken: _Eh_...
<Jaken:    IkiKAEtta...!?>
Jaken: She revived...!?

2
[Jaken looks on dumbfounded as Sesshoumaru leaves.]
<Jaken:    tte, ano_, SESSHOUMARU-sama.>

<Jaken:    TENSEIGA de sono MUSUME o oTASUke ni...!?>
Jaken: You saved that girl with Tenseiga...!?

[Closeup of Jaken.]
<Jaken:    so, sonna.>

[Closeup side view of Sesshoumaru with a slight smile.]
<Sesshoumaru:    fu_, TENSEIGA... ka.>
Sesshoumaru: .oO(Heh, Tenseiga... huh.).
<Sesshoumaru:    kono KATANA... TSUKAiyou ni yotte wa, TAKU ni tatsu mo shiren.>
Sesshoumaru: .oO(It seems that... this sword will have it's uses.).

5
[White frame.]
<Sesshoumaru:    INUYASHA yo--->
Sesshoumaru: .oO(Inuyasha...).
<Sesshoumaru:    kono SESSHOUMARU o KOROshi-kirenakatta koto--->
Sesshoumaru: .oO(That you were not able to kill I, Sesshoumaru, is...).



Page 12
1
[Black frame.]
<Sesshoumaru:    izure kisama wa KOUKAIsuru.>
Sesshoumaru: .oO(something you will come to regret.).

(    It's still not clear why Sesshoumaru can use Tenseiga. He could also use
Tetsusaiga to the full with a human arm. I dunno, maybe the swords aren't
quite working how Toutousai intended or someone (eg Inuyasha and
Sesshoumaru's father) did something to them. Still, if he can ressurect
anyone with it (though it'd probably have a time limit) he could certainly
give Inuyasha a hard time... Ie even if people Sesshoumaru sends to attack
or whatever Inuyasha get killed, he just resurrects them.)
