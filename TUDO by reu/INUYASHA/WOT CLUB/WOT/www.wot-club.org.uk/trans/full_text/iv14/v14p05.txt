Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

<Shippou:    INU_koro to Iwarete INUYASHA ga KIZUtsuito-ru kara, HISSHI ni nagusamete oru n-jaro.>
Shippou: Since you're hurt being called "dog-turd", she's desperately trying to confort you, Inuyasha.
<Shippou:    kagome no YASAshisa ja.>
Shippou: Kagome's just being nice.
Fx Inuyasha: (comically) *be stabbed by the words* <gusa>

[Shippou is now sporting a lump on his head, with Inuyasha still looking
angry, but a bit behind them is Miroku and Sango on Kirara.]

<Kouga:    yakamashii_, MIMImoto de kya-kya- SAWAgu na_!
** these two lines aren't as accurate as they could be, but it's hard to keep the same meaning for 'sawagu' across both lines
>
Kouga: Stop going kyaa-kyaa right in my ear - don't panic!
<Kagome:    SAWAgu wa yo_, kya-kya- kya-kya-.>
Kagome: I am panicked! Kyaa-kyaa kyaa-kyaa!

(    A scream of panic or fear (or sometimes surprise or delight) in Japanese is "kyaa".)

[Sango notices a flock of what look like birds behind her.]
Fx birds: fwomph <Zawa>
Fx birds: flap-flap <Basa Basa>
Sango: !?

[Closeup of the "birds" - these creatures do have bird-like wings and feet,
but instead of a sleek body they have a big fat head with large eyes and
big toothly mouth, and they also have the torso and above of humanoid
figures on top of their heads, who have clawed hands.]
Fx birds: flap-flap <Basa Basa>

strong wind.]

<Kouga:    tobasu ze!>
Kouga: Let's move!

<Kouga:    he_, zamaa miro.>

Kagome: .oO(This... is the Youkai Wolf-Tribe's den...?).

2
[View of the inside of the large cave, with Kagome being dropped to the
floor somewhat unsteadily at the front. All around the cave are wolves and
many wolf-men much like Kouga with various weapons. There's also some
skulls, many human.]
<wolf-man:    BUJI datta ka KOUGA.>
wolf-man: I see you're back okay Kouga.
<Kouga:    ou.>
Kouga: Yeah.

3
[Several wolf-men are looking at Kagome now, who looks a bit worried.]
<wolf-man#1:    oo_, umasou na ONNA ja nee ka_.>
wolf-man#1: Ooh! That's a tasty looking girl you have there.
<wolf-man#2:    o, ore-tachi ni mo KUwasete kure.>
wolf-man#2: P, please let us eat her too.
Fx Kagome: urkk! <giku_>



Page 17

[Kouga responds angrily.]
<Kouga:    kono ONNA wa ESA ja nee_.>
Kouga: This girl ain't food!
<Kouga:    NUSUmiGUi shita yatsu wa bu_KOROsu zo.>
Kouga: Anyone who eats her will die.

[Closeup of Kagome with a thoughful, considering look.]
<Kagome:    SUKUnakutomo...>

<Kagome:    IMAsugu INOCHI o torareru koto wa naimitai...>
Kagome: .oO(it doesn't look like my life's in danger right now...).

3
[Kouga now holds up Shippou, who has a worried look.]
<Kouga:    temee-ra wa kore demo KUtte GAMANshitoke.>
Kouga: You lot can put up with eating this.
<Kouga:    kuttsuite ki-yagatta.>

<Kagome:    chotto yamete_.>
Kagome: Stop that now!

5
[Closeup of Kagome speaking forcefully.]
<Kagome:    anta atashi no CHIKARA KAritai n-ja nai no!?>
Kagome: You want me to help you, don't you!?

6
[Closeup of Kouga with a smirk.]
<Kouga:    he_.>
Kouga: Heh.
<Kouga:    korya HANASHI ga HAEe na.>
Kouga: This'll make things easy.

[Drawing of several of the monsterous birds from earlier.]
<Kouga:    OSOtte kita TORI-domo ga ita darou.>
Kouga: {off} It's the birds who came after us.
<Kouga:    GOKURAKUCHOU to itte na,>
Kouga: They're called the Gokuraku-chou,
<Kouga:    ore-re YOUROUZOKU no TENTEKI mitee na mon yo.>
Kouga: and we Youkai Wolf-Tribe are like their natural enemy.

(    Gokuraku-chou literally means "paradise bird". Doesn't seem to have some
other meaning as far as I can tell.)

2
[Kagome and Shippou are sitting on what looks like a bed in an alcove,
facing Kouga. Some wolf-men are looking on.]
<Kouga:    sono GOKURAKUCHOU no OYADAMA ga, SHIKON no kakera o MOtte-ru.>
Kouga: The Gokuraku-chou's boss has Shikon fragments.
<Kouga:    okagede NAKAMA ga NANNIN mo KUwareta.>
Kouga: On top of that, many of my friends have been eaten by them.
<Kagome:    haa...>
Kagome: I see...

3
[Closeup of Kouga, looking serious.]
<Kouga:    yatsu-ra no SU o OSOi, SHIKON no kakera o bunDOru.>
Kouga: We'll attack their nest, and nab the Shikon fragments.
<Kouga:    OYADAMA no KARADA no, doko ni kakera ga aru ka OSHIero.>
Kouga: You'll tell me where the fragments are on the boss.

4
[Closeup of Kagome looking serious.]
<Kagome:    wakatta...>
Kagome: All right...
<Kagome:    yaru wa.>
Kagome: I'll do it.
<Kagome:    SOTO ni DEreba INUYASHA ni Aeru kamo shirenai.>
Kagome: .oO(If I can get out, maybe I'll be able to meet Inuyasha.).
