Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

Title: Why I let them escape

(    Rather hard to translate this. It seems to be Kagome saying this, but she
doesn't refer to _anybody_ - neither a 'they' or a 'he'.)

Fx Inuyasha: (dirt) *kick up* <baba_>


(    Well it's been a long time since Kagome's been back home. (at least, from
what we've seen, though we do see every single time she goes back home) By
the way, the last two stories (this one, and the previous one with
Sesshoumaru and Toutousai) have been more slapstick and comical than
normal. Actually this chapter has a comical/gag style more like a typical
Ranma 1/2 story. I'm not sure if this is just to balance the previous
darker story with Naraku and Kikyou, or what... Also, I don't see anything
to suggest that Kagome actually does have any particular feelings towards
Kouga - more like how she'd act to two boys from her class, trying to have
a fight.)
