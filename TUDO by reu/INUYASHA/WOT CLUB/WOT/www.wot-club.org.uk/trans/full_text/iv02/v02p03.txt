Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

(    Rather reminds me of Yakumo from 3x3 Eyes, though he has a much better
personality - the term for 'immortal' is the same.)

3
[Kagome takes the fragment out and it glows in the darkness.]
<Kagome:    atta...>

>

<Kagome:    ITAi nara ITAi tte Iinasai yo.>

<Inuyasha:    urusee...>
Inuyasha: Shuddup...

(    There is a similar scene near the beginning of Ranma 1/2, volume 1, part 7
to be precice, just after Ranma knocks out Kuno.)

6
[A closeup of the skull shows a tiny midget (he's smaller than the eye
sockets of the skull) who looks rather old, and is about as wide as his is tall.]
<midget:    oSAGAshi shimashita zo...>
midget: It has been a awful search...
<midget:    INUYASHA-sama>
midget: Inuyasha-sama.
