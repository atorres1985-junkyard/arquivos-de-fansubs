Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

[Inuyasha stands looking at the blade held in front of him, which has now
changed considerably. It is about 3 inches wide at the hilt, widening
several inchs up the blade and curving slightly. It looks about as long as
Inuyasha is tall, and is smooth and white, and glowing at the end. In the
trailer a week before the series started, Inuyasha was shown with a large,
wrapped up sword over his shoulder - looks like he has it now.]

[Kagome looks on as Inuyasha flicks Myouga away.]
<Inuyasha:    NIgeta ro omae.>
Inuyasha: You ran, didn't you.
Fx Myouga: *squish* <buchi>
<Myouga:    a``>
Myouga: _Ack._

[A wide view of some fields by the village.]

2
[Closeup of two fingers holding the slightly glowing black pearl.]
<Kaede:    hoo...>
Kaede: {off} Hmmm....
<Kaede:    kono KURO SHIN JU no NAKA ni INUYASHA no CHICHI no HAKA ga...>
Kaede: {off} So Inuyasha's father's tomb was inside this black pearl...

[View of some children in the village, and a woman carrying something in buckets.]
Fx chicken: *flap wings* <batata>

4
[Inside Kaede's house, they sit in front of the fireplace. Kaede (who still
has her arm in a sling) holds the pearl between her fingers, while looking
at Kagome, who has her satchel with her.]
<Kaede:    shikashi, naze kagome ni TETSUSAIGA to yara ga NUketa no ka...>

[Kagome and Kaede turn to look at Myouga who's sitting on Kagome's right shoulder.]
<Kaede:    nanika FUSHIGI na CHIKARA ga aru no ka no.>

<Myouga:    washi ga OMOu ni...>
Myouga: I suspect...
<Myouga:    kagome ga NINGEN datta kara koso NUketa no dewa nai ka to...>
Myouga: That Kagome's human may be the reason why she could pull it out...



Page 15
1
[View of Inuyasha's mother lying on a carpet in a richly decorated room,
looking somewhat downcast, while the rusty Tetsusaiga sword (superimposed)
is shown over it.]
<Myouga:    motomoto TETSUSAIGA wa INUYASHA-sama no CHICHI-GIMI ga,>
Myouga: Originally,
<Myouga:    NINGEN de aru HAHA-GIMI no MI o MAMOru  tame ni TSUKUtta YOUTOU na no ja.
            human         mother       body protect         made     spirit power
>
Myouga: Inuyasha-sama's father made the magical sword Tetsusaiga in order to guard Inuyasha-sama's human mother.
<Myouga:    sunawachi...>
Myouga: In other words...

2
[Myouga thinks against a dark background - Kagome's jumper.]
<Myouga:    NINGEN o itsukushimi, MAMOru  KOKORO ga nakereba TSUKAenu  KATANA...
            human    affection    protect heart     if not   can't use katana
>
Myouga: it's a katana that can't be used without affection and protective feelings for humans...

3
[FlashBack Kagome again remembering what Inuyasha said at the end of the last chapter 
<Inuyasha:    ore ga omae o MAMOru ttsu tte n'da.>
Inuyasha: I'm telling you I'll protect you.

EndFlashBack]

<Kagome:    sorede ano TOKI KATANA ga HANNOUshite...>

Page 16
1
[View of Sesshoumaru in humanoid form, against a dark background.]
<Myouga:     moto yori, NINGEN ni TAI shi  JIHI no    KOKORO o ISSAI       MOtanu SESSHOUMARU-sama ni wa,
                        human     opposite compassion heart    completely  not have
>
Myouga: {off} And in the first place, Sesshoumaru-sama completely lacks compassionate feelings for humans,
<Myouga:    TETSUSAIGA o TSUKAeru hazu ga nakatta no ja.>
Myouga: {off} and would never be able to use Tetsusaiga.

2
[Inuyasha sits up in a tree swinging the rusty Tetsusaiga sword up and down
in front of him, looking puzzled. Also, not only has Inuyasha's right eye
completely healed, and also his coat is now undamaged - part of the sleeve
had been melted by Sesshoumaru.]
Fx Inuyasha: *swinging katana* <bun>

(     By the way, the tree behind him looks like it's budding again - ie that
it's Spring. However, from a story continuity point of view, no more than a
week could have passed since it was 'Autumn'. It appears, that like Ranma
1/2, the seasons in the story will pass at the same rate as the story's
being written (ie when it's Autumn in Japan, it's Autumn in the story, and
likewise for the rest of the seasons), irrelevant of story itself, or the
logical paradoxes this produces. Never mind, it's just background.)

3
[Inuyasha looks at the rusty blade in confusion, while Kagome (overlaid)
looks on.]
<Inuyasha:    nan dee kore...>
Inuyasha: What's with this thing...
<Inuyasha:    mata moto no Boro KATANA ni MODOchimatta.>
Inuyasha: it's become a damn rusty katana again.



Page 17
1
[Inuyasha looks down to see Kagome calling up to him.]
<Kagome:    INUYASHA-.>
Kagome: Inuyasha--.
<Inuyasha:    n?>
Inuyasha: Hn?

2
[Closeup of Kagome, smiling, talking up at Inuyasha.]
<Kagome:    OSHIete ageyou ka,>
Kagome: Shall I tell you,
<Kagome:    TETSUSAIGA no TSUKAi KATA.>
Kagome: how to use Tetsusaiga.

3
[Inuyasha jumps down to right in front of Kagome.]
Fx Inuyasha: *lands on ground* <shuta>
<Inuyasha:    hoo.>
Inuyasha: Oh yeah?

4
[Closeup of Kagome pointing at herself while smiling happily.]
<Kagome:    nee, kore kara mo,>
Kagome: Hey, from now on as well.
<Kagome:    sono KATANA de atashi no koto shikkari MAMOreru?>
Kagome: Would you be able to reliably protect me with that katana?

5
[Closeup of Inuyasha looking bewildered.]
<Inuyasha:    haa?>
Inuyasha: Huh?

6
[Inuyasha pats Kagome on her forehead, looking like he thinks Kagome's deranged.]
Fx Inuyasha: *rap rap* <pita pita>
<Inuyasha:    nani uwagoto Itte n-da ome--->
Inuyasha: What kind of delirium are you talking in.
<Inuyasha:    NETSU demo an no ka?>
Inuyasha: You got a fever?

7
[Kagome and Inuyasha shout at each other.]
<Kagome:    ore wa OSSHOU omae o MAMOru tte Itta deshou--!?>
Kagome: Didn't you say "I'll protect you your whole life" !?
<Inuyasha:    Itte ne- daro ISSHOU nante.>
Inuyasha: Didn't say that, not for your whole life.


(    A phrase like "I'll protect you your whole life" is rather close to being a
_marriage proposal_, and can if fact be taken as one. Inuyasha really
didn't say that - it's just Kagome's memory going again, or reading too
much into the situation.)

Page 18
1
[Closeup of Inuyasha pointing back at himself.]
<Inuyasha:    ii ka kagome.>
Inuyasha: Listen Kagome.
<Inuyasha:    ore wa izure HONMONO no YOUKAI ni naru n-da zo.>
Inuyasha: I'll become a real Youkai someday.

2
[Inuyasha turns away from Kagome and looks at Tetsusaiga.]
Kagome: ......
<Inuyasha:    kore sae areba, SHIKON no TAMA nanzo atto iu MA ni ATSUmerareru.
                                                   in a flash    be able to collect
>
Inuyasha: If I have this, I'll be able to collect together the Shikon no Tama in a flash.
<Inuyasha:    ome- nanzo MAMOru tame ni TSUKAtte tamaru ka yo.
                         protect        use      put up with
>
Inuyasha: Use it to protect paltry little you? Get real!

3
[Closeup of Kagome getting quite annoyed.]
Fx Inuyasha: {off} *fall with a thud* <dosha>
<Kagome:    osuwari!>
Kagome: Sit!

4
[Kagome walks off in a bit of a huff, while Inuyasha (lying in the ground)
reaches out after her, with one arm still on Tetsusaiga, which has stuck
vertically into the ground. Myouga watches from a leaf.]
Fx Kagome: *stride stride* <suta suta>
Fx Inuyasha: *steam* <shuu shuu>
<Kagome:    moshikasuruto ii yatsu kamo shirenai to OMOtta WATASHI ga Baka datta.>
Kagome: I'm an idiot who thought there was some chance you might be a nice guy.
<Inuyasha:    MAte_,>
Inuyasha: Wait,
<Inuyasha:    TSUKAiKATA OSHIete ke.>
Inuyasha: tell me how to use it.
<Myouga:    INUYASHA-sama...>
Myouga: .oO(Inuyasha-sama...).
<Myouga:    SEIKAKU o o-NAOshi kudasare....>
Myouga: .oO(You should get your personality fixed.).
