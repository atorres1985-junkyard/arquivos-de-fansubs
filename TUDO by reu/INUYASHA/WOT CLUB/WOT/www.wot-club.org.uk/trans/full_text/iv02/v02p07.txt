Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

while Kagome is still kneeling on the ground, and nearby the Mu-Onna is
looking on.]

<Inuyasha:    SESSHOUMARU temee...>
Inuyasha: Sesshoumaru you bastard...
<Sesshoumaru:    CHICHI-UE mo MYOUna  tokoro ni HAKA o KAKUshita mono yo.
                              strange place     tomb   hidden

<Sesshoumaru:    soko ni HAKA o FUUjita no de arou na.
                         tomb   keep quiet
>
Sesshoumaru: Chichi-ue packed and sealed his tomb in there.


(    How did he manage to do this after he was dead though? The evidence shows
that he managed to do some preparation for his death, so maybe he knew he
was dying, and set it up while he was dying.)

<Inuyasha:    ku_...>

air, with many jagged rocks being the only visible ground, which is mostly
covered by mist. Flying in the air are many large, skeleton birds.
Dominating the entire scene is a <i>HUGE</i> skeleton, which is wearing
armour, and has an animal's head, with two <i>massive</i> incisors, one of
which is broken. There are small trees growing among the skeleton, and

[In a large, round cavern, Sesshoumaru is standing on a floor, covered with
skulls and bones, with Jaken standing next to him. In front of him, is a
platform for a statue of Buddha called 'renge-za' (Lotus Flower Seat). It
looks like the upper surface is supported by many petals of lotus, and the
statue of the Buddha stands, or sits on the surface. You can see many such
statues supported by platforms looking similar to this one, if you visit
Buddhism temples in Japan or other countries. 
The ornament you can see on the platform represents flame, which is
supposed to be seen behind the back of the statue. This represents the
energy or aura emitted from the Buddha. Something similar to a "halo" is
also used for this purpose.]
