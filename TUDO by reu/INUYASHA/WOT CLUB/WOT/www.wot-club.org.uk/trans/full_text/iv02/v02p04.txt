Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

[Inuyasha sits up in a leafless tree, looking to the side, almost looking
sad. Two squirrel-like animals are on the tree-trunk.]
<Title:    HANYOU>
Title: Half-Youkai (Half-Magical)

(    I would recommend reading the page on terms of address
(http://www.wot-club.org.uk/Inuyasha/trans/trans.html) before going any
further.
The word 'Youkai' used here in the Japanese text can be translated as
'monster', 'demon' and so on. However, it is actually a more general term
used to describe a creature which has magical and/or spiritual powers, and
tends to be evil. There isn't a good single word translation of this in
English, so I've decided to leave it untranslated.)

[View of an army encamped by a river at night - there are a few sentries
standing watch, and a few horses are being seen to.]
<voice:    ASU ni wa HONTAI ni  GOURYUU   dekiyou.
           tomorrow  main force join with
>
voice: {off} Tomorrow we'll be able to join with the army's main force.

2
[Closeup of some hands ripping the head off a boar.]
Fx blood: *splatter* <buchi>
Fx boar: (neck) crack! snap! <baki baki>

3
[Sitting on a chair is the army's general, who is holding the boar's head in
one hand, and the body is resting over his left knee. Seated on the ground
in front of him are some officers, and standing around are some sentries.]
<baron:    MINA no MONO KOYOI wa kono SHISH      INIKU ni te SEI o  tsuke yo.
           all     ppl  tonight       wild-boar  meat        spirit
SEI o tsuke=invigorate yourself
>
baron: Everyone, raise your spirits over this wild-boar tonight.
<officer:    oo,>
officer: Ooh,
<officer:    sasuga wa  GOURIKI            MUSOU de  SHIrareta oYAKATA-sama desu na.
           gd as expect herculean strength unmatched known         
>
officer: such great feats of unmatched herculean strength O-Yakata-sama is known by.

(    'Yakata' is a title for a (feudal) lord of a castle - the O-Yakata-sama is
extra politeness necessary when speaking to a superior and you don't want
to lose your head, and his real name isn't known. Since he is not the head
of the whole army, it is possible that he is a vassal who was given a
castle by the _Daimyo_ - feudal lord.)

4
[Two officers happily talk to each other, while the general munches on some meat.]
<officer:    TANOmoshii KAGIri ja.
             reliable   as much as poss
>
officer: He's as amazing as ever.
Fx baron: *munch munch* <gafu gafu>
<baron:    wahahaha, TEKISHOU no   KUBI nejiKItte   kureru wa.
                      enemy general neck wrench off =yaru
>
baron: Whahaha, I'll wrench off the enemy general's neck.

[A hand is seen touching the general's head.]
Fx hand: *light touch* <su_>

2
[Two officers stare in surprise at something off-frame, and a sentry turns
his head around.]
Fx sound: crack! snap! <baki baki>

3
[Someone has just ripped the general's head off, and blood is gushing from
the neck. The dark conceals the person's figure, but he (or maybe she) has
long hair, and pointed ears (like Spock), looks richly dressed, and has a
sheathed sword.]
Fx body: *lurch* <gura...>
Fx blood: *gush* <byu---...>
<man:    doke.>
man: Move.

4
[View of some of the officers staring in shock and surprise as the general's
bleeding body slumps to the ground.]
Fx body: *fall with a thump* <dosha>
<officer1:    o...o-YAKATA-sama_.>
officer1: O...Yakata-sama.
<officer2:    na, nan ja kisama.>
officer2: Wha, what's with you arsehole.



Page 4
1
[We see a full view of the man, who's still holding the general's head in
his right hand. He is richly dressed, and his hair is looks quite similar
to Inuyasha's, and he also has the same slit-eye pupils. On his forehead
there is a crescent moon mark, and covering each cheek near his ears are
two parallel sets of dark marks.]
<man:    kisamara JAMA da.>
man: You arseholes are in the way.
<man:    kono BA o KIre>
man: Get lost..

2
[Closeup of the man's head.]
<man:    JAKEN.>
man: Jaken.
<man:    NIN TOU  JOU o...
         ppl head pole
>
man: [Ready] the Nintoujou... (Human Head Pole)

(    There is a word 'jaken' with different kanji, that means 'hard headed',
'cruel'. With this kanji spelling, Jaken means 'evil view/opinion'.)

3
[A rather hideous little creature with bulging slit-irised eyes is looking
over the general's body and is holding a stick,]
Fx Jaken: *pop up* <hyoi>
<Jaken:    he, hehee.>
Jaken: Yes, my Lord.

4
[A closeup of the creature is even worse, and it looks somewhat like a bird.
It is wearing a small kimono, and a black cap, but no shoes cover it's claw-feet.]
Fx Jaken: *bob about* <hyoi hyoi>
<Jaken:    ehehe.>
Jaken: Ehehe.
<Jaken:    gomenasai yo.>
Jaken: Excuse me.

5
[A view of some of the horrified looking officers.]
<officer:    na''.>
officer: _Wha_.



Page 5
1
[Jaken holds up the stick and pokes it into the ground, and we finally see
what's at the top - the heads of a woman, and an old man, both looking asleep.]
Fx staff: *stake* <ton...>

2
[A closeup of the top of the stick shows that the woman's head is waking up.]
Fx woman's head: *open eyes wide* <ka_>
Fx woman's head: *shake* <buru buru>

3
[Closeup of the woman opening her mouth and screaming.]
Fx woman's head: *shrill noise* <kiiiii>

4
[The woman's head calms down and Jaken reports to his master.]
<Jaken:    ONNA no KAO ga NAki mashite gozaimasu.
           girl    face   screech
>
Jaken: The female face is screeching, O-Lord.
<Jaken:    koko wa oSAGAshi no HAKA dewa GOZAIMASEN na.
                   search      tomb
>
Jaken: It appears that this is not where the tomb is located, O-Lord.
<man:    sou ka...>
man: Yeah...

(    Jaken is speaking to his master in the 'exalted honorific' sense, which
can't be directly translated, so I've conpensated by adding 'O-Lord' to the speach.)

5
[The officers have drawn their swords, and the sentries have readied their spears.]
Fx warriors: *rustle* <za_>
<officer:    ki, kisamara NINGEN dewa nai na_.>
officer: The, these arseholes aren't human.

6
[The man turns to look at them.]
<man:    un?>
man: hm?



Page 6
1
[The man is surround by soldiers, though none look eager to approach.]
Fx warriors: *inch forward...* <jiri...>
<man:    nanda NINGEN domo,>
man: What is it humans,
<man:    mada ita no ka.>
man: haven't you got it yet?
<soldier:    mo, MONO no KE_.>
soldier: An, an evil spirit.

2
[The soldiers charge forward, weapons drawn.]
Fx warriors: Waaaah! <wa---->
<soldier:    TAIJIshite kureru_.
                        indicates one's will
>
soldier: I'll exterminate them.
<soldier:    toriKAKOme-----_>
soldier: Surround them!.

3
[The man walks away, speaking to his servant.]
Fx man: *turn around* <kuru>
<man:    uttoushii.>
man: How annoying.
<man:    JAKEN, kisama ni makaseta.>
man: Jaken, I'll leave these arseholes to you.
<Jaken:    hehee.>
Jaken: Hehee.

4
[Jaken twirls the staff around above his head.]
Fx staff: *twirl around* <kururu>
<Jaken:    hihehehe.>
Jaken: Hihehehe.
<Jaken:    NINDOUJOU no CHIKARA, tokuto     goroujiro.
                        power    thoroughly behold
>
Jaken: Fully observe power of the Nintoujou.

5
[Closeup of the old man's head on the staff - his mouth is wide open, and
energy shines from it.]
Fx man's head: *flash* <ka_>



Page 7

[Flame gushes out of the man's mouth.]
Fx flame: *roar-----* <go---->

2
[View from behind Jaken shows the soldiers being roasted by the flames.]
Fx warriors: *sizzle* <ju_>

3
[Jaken now stands in front of a huge scorch mark. Nothing remains of the soldiers.]
Fx ground: *smoke...* <shuuu...>
<Jaken:    hihe_, atokatamo nai wa.>
Jaken: Hihe, nothing remains of them.



Page 8
1
[Jaken is using the staff to paddle his master over the river (presumably
the one the army was camped by) in a small boat.]
Fx leaves: *rustle...* <za...>
<Jaken:    SESSHOUMARU-sama...>
Jaken: Sesshoumaru-sama...
<Sesshoumaru:    nan da?>
Sesshoumaru: What is it?

(    _Sesshoumaru_ could be translated as 'killing blade'. However, '-maru' was
often used in the names of young males of samurai families, too. They used
such names until they were recognized as an adult in the society, and
adopted a new name after that time.)

2
[Closeup of Jaken speaking to his master.]
<Jaken:    oHAKA no arika...
            tomb    where?
>
Jaken: About the location of the tomb...
<Jaken:    INUYASHA nara SHItteiru no dewa?>
Jaken: Wouldn't _Inuyasha_ know about it?

3
[Side view of Sesshoumaru's rather expressionless face.]
<Sesshoumaru:    INUYASHA...>
Sesshoumaru: Inuyasha...

4
[Sesshoumaru casually backhands Jaken, sending him into the river.]
Fx Jaken: *whack* <baki>
Fx Jaken: *splash* <basha>
<Jaken:    buwa_>
Jaken: Bwa!

5
[Jaken splashes about in the river, while his master grinds the staff on his
neck, still not looking around at him.]
Fx Sesshoumaru: (proding Jaken with the Nintoujou) *grind grind* <gui gui>
Fx Jaken: *glub glub* <buku buku>
<Sesshoumaru:    MUNAkuso WARUi HANYOU no koto nado OMOi  DAsaseru na.
                 disgusting     half-mag       etc  think make come  
>
Sesshoumaru: You made me think about that disgusting Half-Youkai thing.
<Jaken:    auuu_, oYURUshi o.>
Jaken: Agh, I beg forgiveness.

6
[Closeup of Sesshoumaru.]
<Sesshoumaru:    DAIICHI yatsu wa Ikite wa oran.>
Sesshoumaru: Firstly, that guy isn't alive.
<Sesshoumaru:    FUUIN sareta to KIite iru zo.>
Sesshoumaru: I hear that he was sealed up.

7
[Head just above water, Jaken explains something to his master.]
Fx Jaken: *glub glub* <buku buku>
<Jaken:    de, desukara sono FUUIN ga,>
Jaken: Th, that's why [I am saying this], that seal,
<Jaken:    TOkareta to...>
Jaken: has been undone...

8
[Sesshoumaru looks around, still looking rather expressionless.]
<Sesshoumaru:    nani?>
Sesshoumaru: What?

[View of the bright sky.]

2
[More of the same sky.]
<midget:    hii.>
midget: Huff.
<midget:    hii.>
midget: Huff.

3
[A small thing is jumping over the ground toward the village.]
Fx midget: *boing* <pin>
<midget:    hii.>
midget: Huff.
<midget:    mou MITSUKA mo ARUki zume ja.>
midget: It's already the 3rd day I've been walking for.

4
[It is the midget from the end of the previous chapter, and his walking
along the ground, sweating somewhat.]
<midget:    hito YASUmi suru ka no.>
midget: Time for a breather perhaps.

5
[Right behind him a bicycle tire suddenly appears.]
Fx bike: *rattling on rough gravely ground* <gagaga>

6
[It's Kagome, who riding a simple girls bike, and she's changed her clothes
again - another short skirt, but this time she's wearing a black cardigan.
A medical bag is sitting in the front basket, and Kagome has a bag over her
shoulder. This may be a reference to Shampoo from Ranma 1/2, who caused
casualties with her bike riding.]
Fx bike: *clatter* <katata>
Fx midget: *squish* <buchi>
<Kagome:    n?>
Kagome: Hn?



Page 10
1
[Side view of Kagome, looking a little surprised.]
Fx bike: *chain clicking when bike not being peddled---* <sha---->
<Kagome:    nanka HIita mitai na...>
Kagome: It feels like I run something over...
<Kagome:    KI no sei ka na.>
Kagome: Maybe it's just my imagination.

2
[View of some houses in the village.]
<Inuyasha:    KIZU no TEAte daa?>
Inuyasha: Treatment for wounds?

3
[Inuyasha is lounging up in a tree, and Kagome stands by her bike below,
speaking up to him.]
<Inuyasha:    irane- yo, nanmon.>
Inuyasha: Don't need any.
<Kagome:    dame yo, hidoi Kega shiteta ja nai.>
Kagome: Stop that, you got wounded terribly didn't you.

4
[View of Kagome speaking up to Inuyasha.]
<Kagome:    Orite.>
Kagome: Come down.

5
[Inuyasha continues to lie back with his eyes closed.]
<Inuyasha:    fun.>
Inuyasha: Hah.

6
[Kagome commands Inuyasha again, and he splats into the ground. Careful
examination of his hands reveal that the first and forth fingers are
extended, while the others are retracted. You'll see this pose frequently
in Ranma 1/2.]
<Kagome:    osuwari.>
Kagome: Sit.
Fx Inuyasha: thump <dogo>



Page 11
1
[Kaede walks along with her left arm in a sling, carrying a bow, and some
village children are walking with her.]
<child:    Kaede-sama oKega wa mou ii no?>
child: Kaede-sama, your injuries are already okay?
<Kaede:    aa, daibu RAKU ni natta yo.
               lot   well
>
Kaede: Aah, I feel a lot better.

(    Presumably Kagome gave Kaede some medical treatment. Why she hasn't given
Inuyasha any (given that it's been three days) will probably never be
known. Maybe he went missing for a while.)

2
[Kaede notices something surprising.]
<Kaede:    mu_.>
Kaede: Hm!

3
[It's Kagome sitting on top of Inuyasha, heatedly trying to pull his clothes
off, while he glares back. Kaede shields the innocent children from bad influences.]
<Kagome:    otonahiku NUide_.
            obidently
>
Kagome: Lie down and undress.
<Inuyasha:    ya-me-ro-yo-.>
Inuyasha: S-to-p th-at.
Fx Kaede: *zip!* <sasa_>
<Kaede:    MIte wa naran.>
Kaede: You mustn't look.

4
[Gripping the front of Inuyasha's coat, Kagome notices the new arrivals.]
<Kagome:    n?>
Kagome: Hn?

5
[Kaede speaks to Kagome, who sweats a bit, while Inuyasha glares back.]
<Kaede:    ... itsu no MA nika  zuibun uchitoketa youda na.
                       interval        inhibited  appears
>
Kaede: ... it appears that you've become a lot less inhibited since I last saw you.
<Kagome:    e''?>
Kagome: _eh?_
<Inuyasha:    ba_,>
Inuyasha: Id,

6
[Inuyasha stands up, and Kagome crashes to the ground.]
Fx Inuyasha: *fwip!* <ba_>
<Inuyasha:    Oriro.>
Inuyasha: Get off.
Fx Kagome: thud <dote>
<Kagome:    kya_.>
Kagome: Kya_

7
[Inuyasha takes his coat and shirt of a bit to reveal his perfectly
undamaged chest.]
Fx Inuyasha: (clothes) *tug* <gui>
<Inuyasha:    ore no KARADA wa TOKUBETSU da tte no ga wakan ne- no ka.
                     body      special
>
Inuyasha: Don't you know that my body is special?

8
[Closeup of Kagome putting her finger to her mouth in surprise.]
<Kagome:    e...>
Kagome: Eh...
<Kagome:    mou NAOtteru...?>
Kagome: You've healed already...?



Page 12
1
[Kagome remembers when Yura cut Inuyasha with her sword.]
<Kagome:    are dake no KATANA KIZU ga ATOkata mo nai nante...
                        katana gash    nothing remains
>
Kagome: .oO(Nothing remains of that earlier katana wound somehow...).

2
[Kagome looks on while Inuyasha puts his clothes back on properly, looking
rather annoyed with the whole situation.]
<Inuyasha:    ke_,>
Inuyasha: Bah.
<Kagome:    FUTSUU ja nai kedo YOUKAI ja nai...
            ordinary           ghost
>
Kagome: .oO(He's not ordinary, but he's not a Youkai...).
<Kagome:    HANYOU...>
Kagome: .oO(Half-Youkai...).
<Kagome:    HANYOU tte ittai...>
Kagome: .oO(What the heck is "Half-Youkai"...).

3
[Inuyasha suddenly parts his shirt to reveal something small stuck to his
chest, while Kagome looks on.]
<Inuyasha:    ide_>
Inuyasha: Ow!
<Kagome:    n?>
Kagome: Hn?

4
[Inuyasha looks down to see the midget from earlier sucking Inuyasha's blood.]
Fx midget: *suck----*<jiyu--->
Fx midget: *swell swell* <muku muku muku>



Page 13
1
[The midget looks up at Inuyasha.]
Fx midget: *smack lips* <chu_>
<midget:    oNATSUkashii.>
midget: At last..
<midget:    INUYASHA-sa...>
midget: Inuyasha-sa...

2
[Kagome looks on as Inuyasha angrily slaps his hand to his chest.]
Fx Inuyasha: *slap* <bachi>
Fx midigt: *squish* <buchi>

3
[Inuyasha holds up his hand to see the mangled midget.]
Fx midget: *flutter like a leaf* <pera-->
<Inuyasha:    n?>
Inuyasha: Hn?

4
[Inuyasha holds out his hand for Kagome, who looks on in surprise.]
<Inuyasha:    nan dei, Nomi-jijii no MYOUGA ja nee ka.
                       flea          Myouga
>
Inuyasha: What the, aren't you Myouga, the flea-jijii?
<Kagome:    Nomi...?>
Kagome: Flea...?

(    Myouga is originally a buddhism term, meaning "unnoticed assistance or
protection of the buddha", from which the current meaning of "great
fortune" was derived.)

5
[View from outside of Kaede's house, with two children and an old man
looking curiously at Kagome's bike.]
<Inuyasha:    ore no oyaji no HAKA o abakou to shiteru YATSU ga iru?
                              tomb   violate           guys
>
Inuyasha: {off} You know some guys who're going to violate Oyaji's tomb?

(    _Oyaji_ is a rough, slang version for 'father'. _Ofukuro_ is 'mother' in
the same style. Ranma speaks using these words.)

6
[Inuyasha, Kagome, Kaede and Myouga sit around the fire inside Kaede's house.]
<Myouga:    kono MYOUGA HAKAMORI to  shite Itemo TAttemo irarezu...
                 Myouga grave-keeper       
>The expression 'itemo tattemo irrarenai' means "can't stand to do
>nothing (for anxiety)", "is pressed with worries"
>
Myouga: I, Myouga, am too anxious to just stay there as the grave-keeper... 
<Inuyasha:    HAKA o SUtete NIgete  KIta no ka yo.
              tomb   resign run off came
>
Inuyasha: You deserted the tomb, and legged it here didn't you.



Page 14
1
[Kaede speaks to Inuyasha and Kagome, while Inuyasha looks rather bored. The
background shows a _massive_ dog walking among the clouds, holding a bull
in it's jaws.]
<Kaede:    INUYASHA, onushi no CHICHI wa>
Kaede: Inuyasha, I hear your father was
<Kaede:    SAIGOKU o       NEJIRO ni shite ita BAkeINU     deatta to KIku ga...
           country to west citadel             monster dog           heard

>However, in historical literature, 'saigoku' often refers to provinces
>in the Kyushu Island (or its neighborhood) of Japan.

>'Nejiro' surely means "citadel" or "stronghold". but this word is often used 
>figuratively, such as "the base of activity".  

>
Kaede: a monstrous dog who prowled the lands to the west...
<Inuyasha:    anmari OBOete nee kedo na.>
Inuyasha: I don't really remember okay.

2
[Myouga sighs, and looks down at the floor.]
<Myouga:    TSUYOkute RITSUBA na DAIYOUKAI de irashita...
            strong    imposing   big ghost    polite or ita/atta
>
Myouga: He was a strong and imposing Youkai Lord....
Fx Myouga: *sigh--* <ha--->
<Myouga:    nani yori OIshii CHI o shite orareta.
                      tasty  blood 
>
Myouga: And had blood tastier than anything.

3
[Closeup of Kagome.]
<Kagome:    hee?>
Kagome: Hmm?
<Kagome:    ja okaa-san wa?>
Kagome: Then, what about his Okaa-san?

4
[Closeup of Inuyasha looking rather angry.]
<Inuyasha:    urusee na.>
Inuyasha: Shuddup will ya.
<Inuyasha:    SHInda yo, tokku no MUKASHI ni.>
Inuyasha: She's been dead a long time.

5
[Myouga speaks up to Kagome, who looks a little surprised.]
<Myouga:    shikashi HAHA-UE-SAMA mo TAIHEN oTSUKUSHII...>
Myouga: However, his Haha-ue-sama was awfully beautiful...


(    _Haha-ue-sama_ is an old style of addressing family - 'haha' is mother, and
'-sama' is as normal, but the 'ue' is an extra level of politeness.
Konatsu, the downtrodden ninja from Ranma 1/2 uses this when addressing his
'mother' and 'sisters'.)


Page 15
1
[Inuyasha squashes Myouga with his thumb.]
Fx Myouga: *squish* <buchi>
<Myouga:    a''.>
Myouga: _Ah_.

(    The sound effect used to describe Myouga being squashed literally is "The
sound of a ting thing bursting and being flattened when pressed hard",
however it's being used in a figurative sense in this, and later, cases.)

2
[Inuyasha walks outside, looking quite annoyed, while Kagome stares in surprise.]
Fx Inuyasha: *fwip* <ba_>
<Inuyasha:    ke_.>
Inuyasha: Bah.
<Kagome:    a, chotto...>
Kagome: Ah, wait a sec...

3
[Kagome continues to look off at Inuyasha, while behind her, Kaede doesn't
look that surprised.]
<Kagome:    nande...>
Kagome: .oO(Did I...).
<Kagome:    nanka KI ni sawaru koto...>
Kagome: .oO(say something to hurt his feelings...?).

4
[Closeup of Kagome thinking to herself.]
<Kagome:    atashi...>
Kagome: .oO(I...).
<Kagome:    okaa-san no koto KIita dake... yo ne.>
Kagome: .oO(asked only about his mother... didn't I.).

5
[Closeup of Kagome's right eye from the side.]
<Kagome:    otou-san ga YOUKAI de,>
Kagome: .oO(His Otou-san is Youkai,).
<Kagome:    INUYASHA wa HANYOU...>
Kagome: .oO(and Inuyasha is Half-Youkai...).

6
[Text laid over strange patterns.]
<Kagome:    masaka...>
Kagome: .oO(It couldn't be...).
<Kagome:    INUYASHA no okaa-san te,>
Kagome: .oO(that Inuyasha's Okaa-san,).
