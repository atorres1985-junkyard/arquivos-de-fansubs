Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

[A large proportion of the wall has melted away and the soggy mass has piled
up on the floor. The Tetsusaiga sword is sticking up out of the mess and
there is no sign of Kagome. To the side of Sesshoumaru, Inuyasha slides to
a halt, looking worried.]

moved if the background is anything to go by.]

[Sesshoumaru looking on impassively as Kagome points the katana at him while
speaking forcefully, while Inuyasha just looks down at Kagome, sweating a little.]
Fx Kagome: *pointing sword at Sesshoumaru* <bi_>
<Kagome:    anta!>
Kagome: Hey you!
<Kagome:    atashi made HONKI de yatta wa ne>
Kagome: You did that seriously, didn't you!

(    Kagome made a similar comment back in chapter 3, when Inuyasha was
attacking her.)

6
[Closeup of Kagome speaking forcefully.]
<Kagome:    tappuri HANSEI sasete yaru kara,>
Kagome: I'll make you really regret that,
<Kagome:    KAKUGOshinasai yo!>

<Inuyasha:    nande sonna ni Pinpin shite n-da yo.>

2
[Closeup of Sesshoumaru.]
<Sesshoumaru:    sou ka...>
Sesshoumaru: I see...
<Sesshoumaru:    katana no KEKKAI ni MAMOrareta no ka...>
Sesshoumaru: She was protected by the katana's ward huh...

3
[Sitting by his neck, Myouga speaks to Inuyasha.]
<Myouga:    INUYASHA-sama, tamerau koto wa nai.>
Myouga: Inuyasha-sama, you don't need to hesitate.

4
[Closeup of Myouga.]
<Myouga:    SESSHOUMARU-sama no oKARADA nite,>
Myouga: On Sesshoumaru-sama's body,
<Myouga:    TETSUSAIGA no TAMEshi GIri nasai mase.>
Myouga: try to see how well Tetsusaiga cuts.

(    Myouga literally says to try _Tameshi Giri_ on Sesshoumaru, which is what
someone does when testing the blade of a newly recieved katana. This might
be done on a bundle of straw, but mainly by cutting the corpses of executed
criminals. This served as a training method for cutting human bodies in
real practice, as well as a quality test for the katanas. Naturally, the
value of katanas that experienced _Tameshi Giri_ was higher than other katanas.)

5
[Closeup of Sesshoumaru's face shows that his eyes have darkened, and his
pupils have turned white.]
Fx Sesshoumaru: (aura around him) ooohmmm... <zawa...>
<Sesshoumaru:    fu_,>
Sesshoumaru: Heh,
<Sesshoumaru:    you mo hozaita...>
Sesshoumaru: how admirable that you dare to say that...

6
[Inuyasha looks on as Sesshoumaru glows with energy.]
Fx Sesshoumaru: zing... <zawa zawa>
<Sesshoumaru:    kisama gotoki  HANYOU ni TETSUSAIGA ga TSUKAi konaseru ka dou ka...
                        such as h. msh                  can master
>
Sesshoumaru: Whether or not a Half-Youkai arsehole like you can master Tetsusaiga...



Page 11
1
[Sesshoumaru dominates the frame, with energy training behind him, while
Inuyasha stands in front of Kagome.]
Fx Sesshoumaru: zz-zing... <zazazaza....>
<Sesshoumaru:    kono SESSHOUMARU ga MITODOkete kureru wa.>
Sesshoumaru: I, Sesshoumaru, shall see it with my own eyes.
Kagome: !?

2
[A closeup of Sesshoumaru's face shows that his mouth has widened and become
lined with teeth and protrudes more from his face, which is now covered
with fur.]

[The scene exapands to show a massive demonic dog-like monster towering over

<Kagome:    ba, BAketa...>

<Inuyasha:    ke_, HONSHOU arawashi yagatta.>
Inuyasha: Ack, he's revealed his true fucking form. 


Page 13

[Inuyasha charges forward, taking the sword back in preparation to strike.]
Fx Inuyasha: *leap* <ba_>
<Inuyasha:    KATANA no Sabi ni shite yaraa!>
Inuyasha: I'll make your blood rust on this katana.

(    A typical cliche that appears in samurai dramas is to threaten the opponent
by declearing that the opponent's body will become the rust of the
speaker's katana. The katana doesn't actually have to be rusty for the
cliche, and also the Japanese in the above sentance is actually somewhat unclear.)

3
[Inuyasha strikes Sesshoumaru on the crescent-moon mark on his head.]
Fx katana: swish! <byu_>
Fx katana: whump <doka>

4
[Closeup of the sword blade.]
Fx katana: *hummm* <biiiin>

<Inuyasha:    ha, haneKAEsareta!?>
Inuyasha: It, it rebounded!?

2
[Inuyasha finds himself almost about to be eaten by Sesshoumaru.]
Fx Sesshoumaru: swish-- <sha--->
<Inuyasha:    ku_.>
Inuyasha: Ugh.

[Inuyasha manages to evade and the monster bites into the side of the room.]
Fx wall: *da-da-da-da* <gagaga>
Fx rocks: *crunch crack* <baki baki>

4
[Inuyasha speaks to Myouga, who appears shocked.]
<Inuyasha:    oi_, MYOUGA jijii_ dou natte n-da.>
Inuyasha: Hey, Myouga-jijii, what's become of this?
<Myouga:    hai!?>
Myouga: Yes!?

5
[Closeup of Inuyasha speaking forcefully.]
<Inuyasha:    KIreru     dokoroka, Tankobu mo dekine- ja nee ka yo.
              can behead far from  bruise
>
Inuyasha: It can't even bruise him, let alone behead him!
<Myouga:    auu.>
Myouga: Erm.

<Myouga:    to_ tonikaku INUYASHA-sama,>
Myouga: Anyway Inuyasha-sama,
<Myouga:    kono KATANA wa CHICHI-GIMI no KATAMI!>
Myouga: this katana is your Father's memento!

3
[Inuyasha looks at Myouga, who is speaking forcefully.]
<Myouga:    KATANA no YOURYOKU o SHINjinasare.>
Myouga: Believe in the katana's spiritual power.
<Myouga:    yumeyume DEBANAshite wa narimasen zo. >
Myouga: You must never abandon it!

4
[Inuyasha yells after Myouga, who leaps from Inuyasha.]
Fx Myouga: *bo-i-ng* <pi---n>
<Myouga:    dewa_, >
Myouga: Well then,
<Myouga:    kore nite GOMEN!>
Myouga: Sorry about leaving now!
<Inuyasha:    temee_.>
Inuyasha: Bastard!

5
[Closeup side shot of Inuyasha charging forwards.]
<Inuyasha:    chi_, chikushou dou surebe...>
Inuyasha: .oO(Ah, crap, how do I ...).
<Inuyasha:    KIreru n-da!?>

(    This shout of encouragement is typically used in boxing matchs.)

3
[Closeup of Inuyasha from behind, suddenly stopping.]
Fx Inuyasha: *loose heart* <gaku>

(    Inuyasha is discouraged because of Kagome's inane comment.)

4
[Inuyasha sidles up to Kagome, looking annoyed.]
Fx Inuyasha: sha <za_>
<Inuyasha:    ano na,>
Inuyasha: Hey you,
<Inuyasha:    ZENZEN KIitene- n-da yo.>
Inuyasha: it did absolutely nothing.
<Kagome:    datte...>
Kagome: But...

5
[Closeup of Kagome speaking happily.]
<Kagome:    sore anta no KATANA nan deshou!?>
Kagome: That's your katana isn't it!?
<Kagome:    atashi wa SHINjiteru kara ne, anta no CHIKARA.>
Kagome: I believe in it you see - your power.

6
[Closeup of Inuyasha glaring at Kagome out of the corner of his eye.]
<Inuyasha:    ke_,>
Inuyasha: Bah,
<Inuyasha:     ii no ka yo  sonna NOUTENKI na koto Ittete.
                                  optimistic       saying

prepares to face his elder brother.]
