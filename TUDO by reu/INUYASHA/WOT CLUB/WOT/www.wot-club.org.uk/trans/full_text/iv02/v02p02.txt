Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

<Yura:    Atte MAmonai ONNA no FUTOKORO ni UDE tsukkomu    nante.

>
Yura: That was a sneaky way to take out the Shikon no Tama though.
<Yura:    OUJOU GIWA no         WARUi koto.
          death on the verge of bad
>I think this is all right. I would add that the expression 'oujou giwa ga warui' 
>rather means that the person is a "bad loser", not necessarily 
>indicating that he is actually dying. (This expression is often used 
>in this figurative manner.) In this case, Yura may be saying this 
>in a turely literal way... 
>
Yura: A bad thing to do on the verge of death.

(    An alternative translation would be that Yura is saying Inuyasha is a bad
looser, but maybe Yura is talking literally in this case.)
