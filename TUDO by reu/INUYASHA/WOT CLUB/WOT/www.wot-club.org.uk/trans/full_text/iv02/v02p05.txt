Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

5
[Closeup of Kagome waking up.]
<Kagome:    u...>
Kagome: .oO(Uh...).

(    In the above passage, Inuyasha's mother is speaking somewhat formally.
Possible reasons for this are: (1) The mother appears to be from a noble
family. (In aristocratic families, it was often the case that mothers did
not raise her son by herself. In addition, it isn't regarded as good
manners for a noble woman to speak in a rough or arrogant manner toward her
son), (2) The mother and the son haven't seen each other for a long time,
and (3) The mother has a mild personality.)

<Kagome:    okaa-san jai nai!?>
