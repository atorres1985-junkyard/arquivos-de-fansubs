Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

[Kagome is now running through a stadium, carrying a big flag of her answer
paper, showing the 100 mark score. A closeup overview of Kagome shows a
little tear in her left eye.]

<answer-paper:    NAMAE - HIGURASHI kagome>
answer-paper: Name - Higurashi Kagome

(    In Japan, family name comes before your given name. Also, for a single
subject/test, the marks are always given out of 100 - ie Kagome got 100%.)

[Closeup of Kagome lying on her sleeping bag, with a little tear in her left eye.]
Kagome: .......

3
[Closeup of a small fire.]
Fx fire: *crackle crackle* <Pachi Pachi Pachi>

(    The fx sound for hands clapping and a fire crackling are both 'pachi pachi'.)

4
[Kagome sits up. She's lying under an old abandoned shine or temple, with
Shippou lying on her sleeping bag, Miroku sleeping against a wall, and
Inuyasha outside sleeping by the fire.]
Fx Shippou: *snooze* <ka-->
<Kagome:    fu_...>

<Kagome:    yappari YUME ka...>
Kagome: .oO(It really is a dream, isn't it...).

(    Kagome means both that she was having a dream, and that it's a dream to get
100% .)

<Kagome:    datte TAISETSU na MOSHI nan da mon_.>

[Kagome and Inuyasha are sitting by a river, and Kagome has her hands
together begging Inuyasha. Nearby Miroku is walking through the river, and
Shippou is looking in.]
<Kagome:    oNEGAi MITSUKA KAN dake_.>
Kagome: Please, just 3 days!
<Kagome:    YOSHUU mo shitai shi-.>

4
[Inuyasha is shouting at Kagome again, who's gotten angry.]

'tesuto' is highlighted.
>
Inuyasha: Do you actually like these "tests" that much?
<Kagome:    SUki na wake nai desho-.>
Kagome: There's no way I'd like them!

(    Kagome uses a modern word for test (just 'test' in english turned into
Japlish - 'tesuto'), which of course Inuyasha wouldn't recognise, and he
doesn't understand what it means.)

5

2
[Inuyasha is still sitting down, while Kagome has picked up her large rucksack.]
<Inuyasha:    n"?>
Inuyasha: _Hn_?
<Inuyasha:    KAEru ja nakatta no ka.>
Inuyasha: Weren't you going home?
<Kagome:    douse KI ni natte BENKYOU ga TE ni tsukanai mon.>
Kagome: Because I'd worry and wouldn't be able to study.

3
[Miroku stands up.]
<Miroku:    sou desu na.>
Miroku: That's right.
<Miroku:    kagome-sama ga iru uchi ni Itta HOU ga.>
Miroku: It would be better to go while Kagome-sama is with us.

Tama and so on.)

Miroku: Indeed.
<Miroku:    SHIKON no kakera o TSUKAtte iru kamo shire mansen.>
Miroku: Maybe it's using a Shikon fragment.

Fx Kagome and others: *stride stride* <suta suta>
Fx Inuyasha: *stride stride* <suta suta>
<Inuyasha:    kora_, temeera ore o MUSHI suru na_.>

<hermit:    mou kono YO ni AISO ga TSUkita to iu kara,>
hermit: and that you are already fed up with this world,
<hermit:    SENNIN ni shite yarou to OMOu ta no ni.>
hermit: I thought I would help you to become a hermit.

4
[The villager backs away from the hermit.]
Fx hermit: (walking forwards) thud... <Zushi>
<man:    ko, koko de MIta koto wa DAREnimo Iwan...>
