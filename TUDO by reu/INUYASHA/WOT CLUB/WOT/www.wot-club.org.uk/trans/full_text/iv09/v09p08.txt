Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

<Title:    TAIJIYA>
Title: Taiji-ya

(    'taiji-ya-san' refers to someone, or a group of people, who does 'taiji'
(in this case, it means 'extermination') for a living. Somewhat like saying
'exterminator-san' - 'ya' normally means 'shop', or sometimes 'worker'.)

[View of the outside of a village up in the hills - it is surrounded by a

watch-towers behind it.]

[The gate is lowered.]
Fx gate: creak creak... <Gigi...>

[In walks Sango, the exterminator, overlaid over some other frames. Sango's
name translates as 'coral' by the way.]
<Sango:    tadaima-.>
Sango: I'm back!

3
[Sango has put her boomerang down and is taking some stuff out of the sack
she was carrying.]
<village woman:    okaeri SANGO-chan.>
village woman: Welcome back, Sango-chan.

<Sango:    yoshi yoshi, KIRARA.>
Sango: There there, Kirara.
<Sango:    ii KO ni shiteta ka?>
Sango: Have you been a good girl?

(    Kirara is a girl's name, rarely used in real life, and literally translates
as "cloud-mother". However, this set of kanji is normally pronounced
"unmo", meaning "mica" (the mineral) or "isinglass". The 'kirara' comes
from the FX for something (eg a precious stone) glittering.)

boy: Welcome back, ane-ue.
<boy:    CHICHUE... oKASHIRA ga YOnderu.>
boy: Chichi-ue... the okashira, is calling for you.

(    ane-ue and chichi-ue are more respectful (and old) versions of onee-san
(elder sister) and chichi (or otou-san) for father. 'Okashira' is a term
typically used for the leader of a group of fighters.)

fragment has been put, and the father (the okashira) makes a bow, and
ritual clap before it.]

Sango: Will this suppress the fragment's evil?

6
[Sango looks at her father, who is still looking at the shrine.]
<okashira:    Dame darou naa.>
okashira: It's probably no good.
<Sango:    yappari nee.>
Sango: I thought so.

[View of the fragment.]
<okashira:    GOJUUNEN hodo MUKASHI, REIRYOKU no TSUYOi MIKO-sama ni oAZUkeshite KIYOmete moratte ita to iu ga...>

<okashira:    kono SATO ni kakera o ATSUme, MAMOtte oku koto kurai da na.>
okashira: collect the fragments in this town, and protect them.

<okashira:    mata sugu SHIGOTO da.>
