Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

[View of a forest.]

voice: {off} Take care of it taiji-ya-san!
<voice:    OO-Mukade ga KUru!>
voice: {off} A giant centipede is coming!

(    'taiji-ya-san' refers to someone who does 'taiji' (in this case, it means
'extermination') for a living. Somewhat like saying 'exterminator-san' -
'ya' normally means 'shop', or sometimes 'worker'. This is a common way to
refer to someone by their trade when you don't know their name - like how
Miroku might be referred to as 'houshi-sama'.)

2
[A young looking person stands decked out in dark armour, with a mask
covering the mouth, a pony-tail of black hair, a sword at the side, and
carrying a huge boomerang (!) in one hand. Hard to be sure of the person's
gender. Right in front of the person (presumably 'exterminator-san') a huge
centipede bursts out of the forest and rears above the person, while some
villages move out of the way.]
Fx trees: crack crack <Baki Baki Baki>

3
[The person makes a big swing with the boomerang.]
<exterminator:    HIRAIKOTSU!>
exterminator: Hiraikotsu!
Fx boomerang: whish <Gyun>

(    'Hiraikotsu', which translates as "Come Flying-skill", is actually the name
of the boomerang.)



Page 17
1
[The giant boomerang spins out and curves through the giant centipede
cutting it in two, and comes back to the exterminator, who catches it.]
Fx centipede: wham <Doka_>
Fx boomerang: whish <Gyun>
Fx exterminator: (boomerang) *catch* <Pashi>

2
[A glowing Shikon fragment comes out of the centipede's body.]
Fx centipede: *fall with a thud* <Dosa>
Fx fragment: *high pitched ringing* <Ki---n>

3
[Closeup of the fragment being picked up by the exterminator.]
Fx hand: *smooth movement* <Su_>
<exterminator:    yappari SHIKON no kakera... ka.>
exterminator: So there was a Shikon fragment after all... huh.

4
[Some villages come over to the person.]
<villager:    TAIJIYA-san, sore wa...?>
villager: Taiji-ya-san, that is...?
<exterminator:    kore ga MOTO de Mukade ga KYOUBOU-KA shita n-da ne.>
exterminator: This is what originally transformed the centipede into that atrocity.

5
[View of a village hut.]
<exterminator:    NAYA o KAriru yo.>
exterminator: I'll make use of the shed for a bit.

6
[Low shot of the person taking off the armour, which falls to the floor.]
Fx armour: clatter <Basa>

7
[The person takes off the mask.]
Fx exterminator: *softly* <Su_>



Page 18

[And finally, we get to see the exterminator's face... It's a cute girl! She
takes off the ribbon tying up her hair, and smiles slightly.]
Fx hair: *flutter* <Basa>

2
[Carrying the huge boomerang strapped over her shoulder, and her armour in a
sack, the girl bows slightly to the villagers, smiling.]
<exterminator:    sore ja mata.>
exterminator: See you again.
<exterminator:    goYOU ka attara oYObi kudasai.>
exterminator: If it happens again, please call me.

3
[The villagers approach the girl, who holds up the fragment.]
<villager:    TAIJIYA-san, oREI no HOU wa...>
villager: Taiji-ya-san, for the reward...
<exterminator:    ii yo. kore moratteku kara.>
exterminator: It's okay. I'll take this.

4
[Closeup of the girl holding the fragment up to inspect.]
<exterminator:    motomoto SHIKON no TAMA wa,>
exterminator: Originally, the Shikon no Tama
<exterminator:    uchi no SATO kara DEta mono dakara sa.>
exterminator: came from my town, you see.
