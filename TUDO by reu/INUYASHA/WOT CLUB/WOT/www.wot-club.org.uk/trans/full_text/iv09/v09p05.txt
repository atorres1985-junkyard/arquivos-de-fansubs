Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

[Closeup of Inuyasha, who has dark patches all over his clothes, and is
still human. He looks almost asleep, with his eyes closed.]

Fx pair: *pop out* <hyoi>
<Shippou:    INUYASHA... daibu maittoru na.>
Shippou: Inuyasha... is really beaten up, isn't he.
<Miroku:    kono Kega desu.>

<Miroku:    HONTOU wa UGOkasanu HOU ga Yoi no daga...>
Miroku: it would really be better not to allow him to move, but...

[It's Kagome, carrying a lamp, and wearing Inuyasha's cloak around her -
though she's folded it so that it fits her better.]

<Kagome:    ARUkeru? INUYASHA.>

[Closeup of Inuyasha with his eyes partly open.]
<Inuyasha:    SOTO...>
Inuyasha: Could you see...
<Inuyasha:    MIeru no ka?>
Inuyasha: outside?

3
[Kagome comes to sit next to Inuyasha.]
<Inuyasha:    ASA wa...>
Inuyasha: Sunrise is...?
<Kagome:    mada makKURA.>
Kagome: It's still pitch-dark.
<Kagome:    tonikaku...>
Kagome: Anyway...

4
[Closeup of Kagome.]
<Kagome:    anta no YOURYOKU ga MODOru made NIgeru shika nai wa.>
Kagome: all we can do is escape until your powers return.

[View from outside of a shear cliff with a room half-way up it. It's pitch
black outside.]
Fx wind: whoosh... <Hyuu--->
Inuyasha: ......

2
[Inuyasha is leaning over the railing looking down, with a somewhat
incredulous look.]
<Inuyasha:    ... kore ka? SOTO ni DEraresou na TOKORO tte.>
Inuyasha: ... This is it? Your "place where we might be able to get out from?"
<Kagome:    dame?>
Kagome: It's no good?

3
[Inuyasha puts his hand over his face in despair.]
Inuyasha: ......

4
[Inuyasha and Kagome discuss things.]
<Inuyasha:    yoshi, kou shou.>
Inuyasha: Okay, this is what we'll do.
<Kagome:    iya yo.>
Kagome: No way.

5
[Inuyasha turns to Kagome in surprise.]
<Inuyasha:    mada nanimo Ittenee.>
Inuyasha: I haven't said anything yet.
<Kagome:    atashi hitori o NIgasu tsumori desho.>
Kagome: You want me to escape alone, don't you.
<Kagome:    iya yo.>
Kagome: No way.

6
[Inuyasha and Kagome turns back to look into the room.]
Fx sound: hsst... <Hyu---...>
<voice:    DAREka...>
voice: {off} Is someone...
<voice:    iru no ka...?>
voice: there...?
Inuyasha: !



Page 6
1
[Kagome and Inuyasha look in surprise as a small plant pot, in which is a
short thick vine, with a large flower, which has the head of an old man,
with long white hair and beard, who has his eyes closed.]
Fx old man: (breathing) hsst... <Hyu--....>
<Kagome:    kya_...>
Kagome: Kyaa...!

2
[Wider view of Inuyasha and Kagome looking down at the man.]
Fx old man: hsst... <Hyu---...>
<hermit:    HITO no KOE o KIku no wa... NANNEN buri ka...>
hermit: How many years has it been... since I've heard someone's voice...?
<Kagome:    a...>
Kagome: Ah...

3
[Kagome comes to talk to the man.]
<Kagome:    ano... ojii-san mo TOUKAJIN ni TAberareta n-desu ka?>
Kagome: Umm... Have you been eaten by Toukajin as well, ojii-san?

(    'ojii-san' is a polite way to address an old man - literally 'grandfather'.)

4
[Closeup of the old man, still with his eyes closed.]
<old man:    FUKAKU de atta...>
old man: It was my mistake...
<old man:    ano you na MONO ni waga SENJUTSU o...>
old man: to [teach] a person like that my wizardry...

[Inuyasha looks surprised.]



Page 7

[Kagome looks a bit confused.]
<Kagome:    e...>
Kagome: Eh...
<Kagome:    sore ja ojii-san SENNIN...?>
Kagome: Then, you're a hermit, ojii-san...?

(    Perhaps 'hermit' is not the best translation for "sennin", in this case. It
is also reffers to folklore about 'mystics' (fairies) who live in the
moutains and can perform 'miracles'. Another translation of 'senjutsu'
(wizardry) is 'fairy magic' - ie the magic of a 'sennin'.)

2
[Closeup of the old man.]
<hermit:    HAzukashi nagara...>
hermit: While I'm ashamed [to admit it]...
<hermit:    TOUKAJIN no SHISHOU deatta.>
hermit: I was Toukajin's Master.

3
[Inuyasha comes and throttles the old-man-plant, to Kagome's distress.]
Fx Inuyasha: (hermit) *grip* <Gui>
<Inuyasha:    temee!>
Inuyasha: You bastard!
<Kagome:    cho, chotto INUYASHA...>
Kagome: Ju, just a sec, Inuyasha...

4
[Closeup side view of Inuyasha speaking angrily.]
<Inuyasha:    SENNIN ga KIite akireru ze.>
Inuyasha: I'm amazed to hear you're a hermit.
<Inuyasha:    nandatte anna HITOKUi YOUKAI ni SENJUTSU o OSHIeta!?>
Inuyasha: Why did you teach that man-eating Youkai your wizardry!?

5
[Closeup of the old man.]
<hermit:    yatsu wa...>
hermit: That guy is...
<hermit:    TOUKAJIN wa...>
hermit: Toukajin is...
<hermit:    YOUKAI dewa nai...>
hermit: is not a Youkai...

6
[Closeup of Inuyasha looking surprised.]
<hermit:    HONTOU ni tada no NINGEN datta no da...>
hermit: {off} He really was an ordinary human...
Inuyasha: !

[Closeup of Inuyasha.]
<Inuyasha:    ke_, koitsu ga NINGEN datta da to!?>
Inuyasha: Bah! This guy was human!?
<Inuyasha:    WARAwasen na!>
Inuyasha: Don't make me laugh!

3
[Miroku pops up at Inuyasha's shoulder.]
<Miroku:    NINGEN ga YOUKAI KAsuru koto da tte aru no desu.>
Miroku: I have heard that humans can be changed into Youkai.

4
[View of Toukajin, radiating evil looking energy.]
Fx Toukajin: hsst... <Shu--->
<Miroku:    kono OTOKO, yohodo JANEN ga TSUYOkatta no deshou.>

[Toukajin makes a wave with his staff, and several large spiky plants shoot
out towards Kagome and Inuyasha, and Inuyasha jumps off with Kagome.]

<Kagome:    INUYASHA!>

<Inuyasha:    ku_.>
Inuyasha: Ugh.

2
[Toukajin looms near the pair, the spikey plants laid about the room. Kagome
looks on in shock, while Inuyasha is in pain, lying on the ground.]
Fx Toukajin: hsst <Shu---->
<Toukajin:    NINGEN nante kudaranee yo.>
Toukajin: Humans are just so pathetic.
<Toukajin:    YOWAkute zurukute,>
Toukajin: weak, cunning,
<Toukajin:    ASA kara BAN made DORO darake ni natte HATARAite, TOSHI to tte SHInu dake nante yo.>
Toukajin: from morning to night they work covered in mud, and they just get old and die.

[View of a unrolled scroll, covered in writing.]
<Toukajin:    NANNENka SHUGYOUshite, sokosoko SENJUTSU o OBOeta KORO,>
Toukajin: {voice over} Around the time when I had trained for a couple of years and I mastered spells somewhat,
<Toukajin:    SHISHOU no RUSU no AIDA ni MAKIMONO o NUSUmiMIte na.>
Toukajin: I secretly looked at the scrolls while Master was away.



Page 12

[View of a much younger and thinner Toukajin standing over the body of his
master, a bloody axe in his hand.]
<Toukajin:    TEttori BAYAku SENNIN ni naru ni wa...>
Toukajin: {off} I learned that the best way to become a hermit quickly and easily was...
<Toukajin:    SENJUTSU o ETOKUshite, SENNIN no NIKU o KUu no ga ICHIBAN da to SHItta no yo.>
Toukajin: to understand the spells and to eat the hermit's meat.
<Toukajin:    dakara...>
Toukajin: And so...

2
[Closeup of the old man.]
Fx hermit: hsst... <Shu-...>
<Toukajin:    mottomo, SAIGO no HIJUTSU...>
Toukajin: But then, for the final secret spell...
<Toukajin:    FUROUCHOUJU no KUSURI no TADAshii TSUKUri KATA dake wa, soitsu no ATAMA n-NAKA ni aru rashii.>
