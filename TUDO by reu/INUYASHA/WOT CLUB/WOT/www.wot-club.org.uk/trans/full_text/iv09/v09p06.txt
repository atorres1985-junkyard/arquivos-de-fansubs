Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

Toukajin: After I've tortured this Half-Youkai to death, I'm gonna eat you leisurely.

(    Toukajin is talking to Kagome like a robber,bandit or gangster would to a
potential female victim - 'nee-chan' literally means 'elder sister', but in
this sense it would be more likey 'missy' or 'babe' or something.)

Toukajin: ......

(    The arrow Kagome just fired was very much like the two Kikyou fired at
Inuyasha 30 chapters ago. This is the first time Kagome's arrows have gone
like this, though it is not impossible that the old hermit could have
boosted the power.)
