Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

<guard#2:    WAKA ga TONO no KUBI o...>
guard#2: The young master cut off tono's head...
<guard#3:    WAKA_ nani o...>
guard#3: Young master! What are you...

(    The word for 'young master' is 'waka' (just means 'young'), but it is also
a name. I think it's being used as a term of address here.)



Page 13
1
[Closeup of the young man.]
<young master:    kore wa TONO dewa nai.>
young master: This is not tono.
<young master:    MIte miyo.>

Fx sword: *stab* <Dosu>

6
[View of the young man looking a bit sorrowful.]
<young master:    CHICHI no YOUSU... JINJOU dewa nai to OMOtte ita ga,>
young master: I had been thinking that Father's appearance... was not his usual, but...
<young master:    YOUKAI ni nottorarete ita no da na.>
young master: he'd actually been taken over by a Youkai.

7
[View of Sango and Kohaku, unmoving in a large pool of blood.]
<young master:    TAIJIYA-tachi wa KI no DOKU na koto o shita.>

<young master:    NIWA no sumi ni demo Umete yare.>

[View of a forest between hills at night.]
Fx leaves: rustle... <Zaza...>

2
[Kagome and Miroku, and up ahead Inuyasha, with Shippou on his shoulder, are
walking through the forest.]
<Miroku:    mairi mashita na.>
Miroku: This is no good, is it.
<Miroku:    DARE hitori TAIJIYA no MURA no BASHO o SHIranu to wa.>
Miroku: Not a single person knows where the taiji-ya's village is.
<Kagome:    YAMA no NAKA tte dake ja ne-.>
Kagome: Only that it's "in the mountains".
<Inuyasha:    urusee SAGAsu n-da.>
Inuyasha: Shut up and look.

3
[Shippou has a word with Inuyasha.]
<Shippou:    INUYASHA,>
Shippou: Inuyasha,
<Shippou:    TAIJIYA no MURA kara SHIKON no kakera UBAu KI ka?>
Shippou: do you intend to steal the Shikon fragment from the taiji-ya's village?
<Inuyasha:    _tari me- daro.>
Inuyasha: Of course I do.

4
[Miroku and Kagome look on.]
<Miroku:    GYAKU ni TAIJI sarenai to ii desu kedo ne.>
Miroku: Hopefully he won't be exterminated in return.
<Kagome:    so- ne- mukou wa Puro mitai da shi.>
Kagome: Yeah... the one back there seemed like a pro.

(    Kagome uses another foreign loan-word, and actually does say 'pro'
(professional) - nobody would understand her 20th centuary vocabulary...)

5
[Closeup side view of Kagome.]
<Kagome:    demo atashi mo SHIritai...>
Kagome: .oO(But I want to know as well...).
<Kagome:    SHIKON no TAMA ga dou shite Umareta no ka.>
Kagome: .oO(Why was the Shikon no Tama created?).



Page 15

4
[View of the darkening night sky.]
Fx sky: rumble... <Gooooo....>

5
[View of Kagome looking up at the sky worriedly.]
Fx Kagome: (heart) *thump thump thump* <Doki Doki Doki>

kinds of Youkai flying through the sky.]

[Kagome and the others look shocked.]

Page 17
1
[Kagome looks a bit tense.]
Fx Kagome: *shiver...* <Zoku...>
<Kagome:    monosugoi YOUKI...>
Kagome: .oO(An incredible amount of Evil...).
<Kagome:    nani sore... tada no YOUKI ja nai wa...>
Kagome: What this... it doesn't feel like ordinary Evil...

(    'youki' (what I'm translating as 'Evil') is rather tricky - my dictionary
say 'sinister atmosphere', though it could supposed to mean 'the evil
presense of Youkai' or similar...)

2
[Miroku and Inuyasha look on.]
<Miroku:    TASHIkani... MAGAMAGAshisa ni KIBUN ga WARUku naru.
** magamagashisa = ??
>
Miroku: It certainly... feels like something terrible is about to happen.
Inuyasha: ......

Inuyasha: They're out to kill...
<Inuyasha:    yatsura nanika o OSOu KI da ze.>
Inuyasha: That lot are going to attack something.

2
[The group rush forwards.]
<Miroku:    Oimashou!>
Miroku: Let's go after them!
Fx group: swoosh <Za_>

3
[Black frame.]

4
[View of rich looking building at night.]
<guard#1:    ano TAIJIYA no MUSUME...>
guard#1: That taiji-ya girl...
<guard#1:    yoku MIrya kawaii KAO shiteta yo.>
guard#1: She had a cute face, if you took a close look.

5
[Two guards are walking through a garden, one carrying a lamp.]
<guard#1:    kawaisou ni naa.>
guard#1: Such a shame.
<guard#2:    sou ka,>
guard#2: Really...?
<guard#2:    omae Umeta n-ka.>

young master: You're still alive...
