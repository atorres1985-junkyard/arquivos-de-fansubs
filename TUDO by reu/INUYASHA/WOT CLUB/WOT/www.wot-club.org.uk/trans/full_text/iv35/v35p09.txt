Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

[Inuyasha whacks all the kids on the head.]

2
[The kids, now with their masks off, look like ordinary dirty kids.]

kid: You fucking bastard!

3
[Miroku and Sango look at the dead Youkai.]
<Miroku:    dou yara, HONTOU ni tada no KOdomo-tachi desu na.>
Miroku: It seems that they were really just ordinary children.
<Sango:    sore ga doushite konna koto o...>
Sango: But how did they manage to do this...

4
[Inuyasha threatens the kids.]
<Inuyasha:    saa HAKUJOU shi na.>
Inuyasha: Now then, confess.
<Inuyasha:    sono TSUBO dou yatte TE ni Ireta.>
Inuyasha: How did you get your hands on those pots.

<kid#2:    SHINda tte Iu mon ka.>

[Inuyasha is now pulling one kid's cheek and otherwise abusing them lightly.]
Fx kid: (cheek) *squeeze...* <Gyu--->
<kid:    idede idede.>

<Kagome:    chotto INUYASHA.>
Kagome: Hey, Inuyasha.
<Shippou:    aikawarazu KOdomo ni mo YOUSHA nashi ja na.>

2
[View of Kagome talking to one of the kids.]
<Kagome:    nee, sonna TSUBO MOttecha ikenai wa.>
Kagome: Say, you really shouldn't carry those pots.

3
[Closeup of Kagome.]
<Kagome:    anta-tachi mitai na KOdomo ga konna ABUnai koto...>
Kagome: Because with children like you doing such dangerous things...
<Kagome:    itsuka hiodoime ni aru kara.>
Kagome: you'll end up in a bad situation some day.

[The kids are defiant.]

<kid#2:    kono GORYOUTSUBO ga aru KAGAri YOUKAI nanzo ni MAkenee.>
kid#2: As long as we have these Goryou-pots, we'll never lose to mere Youkai.
<Shippou:    IMA MAketa bakari dewa nai ka.>
Shippou: Didn't you lost just now?

(    Goryou here is the same as in Goryoumaru. Goryou doesn't seem to mean
anything special ("honorable spririt" approximately), so is perhaps just
short for "Goryoumaru's pots".)

5
[The kids run off, carrying their pots.]
Fx kids: *dash* <Da_>
<kid#1:    OBOete-ro.>
kid#1: We'll get you for this.

[View of Sango and Miroku.]

Sango: They called themselves Gyouja, but with that attitude...
<Sango:    TOKUBETSU YOUKAI TAIJI no KUNREN o Ukete-ru tomo OMOenai.>
Sango: I can't think that they got special Youkai extermination training.
<Miroku:    arui wa NARAKU no TESHITA ka to OMOtta ga,>
Miroku: We had thought the Gyouja could be working for Naraku,
<Miroku:    isasaka oSOMATSU desu na.>
