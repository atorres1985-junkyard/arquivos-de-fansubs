Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

[View of a house at night.]
Fx area: rumble... <Goooo>

2
[Kagome and Shippou are outside, beside a fire, with Sango nearby. Inuyasha
is a short distance from them.]

Fx wind: howl... <hyu--->
<Kagome:    SAMUi...>

Shippou: Say, why is Miroku the only one inside the house?
<Kagome:    saa...>
Kagome: I dunno...
<Kagome:    HANASHI o tsukeru to ka Itte-ta kedo.>
Kagome: He did say that he wanted to discuss things though.

4
[Shippou looks up at Kagome.]
<Shippou:    MUKOIri no HANASHI o KOTOWAru no ka?>
Shippou: Will he refuse to join the family?
<Kagome:    sorya sou desho.>

[Closeup of Inuyasha.]
<Inuyasha:    SHINYOUshite ii no ka?>
Inuyasha: Can you really trust him?
<Inuyasha:    MIROKU da zo.>
Inuyasha: It's Miroku after all.
<Inuyasha:    SUeZEN KUwanu wa OTOKO no HAJI daro.>
Inuyasha: "Shame on a man who does not accept a woman's proposition", right?

(    Inuyasha is quoting a saying. The literal translation is probably something
like "Shame on a man who does not eat the meal set before him".)

2
[Closeup of Sango with a dark expression.]
Fx Sango: twitch <piku>

3
[Kagome shouts angrily at Inuyasha, who falls onto the ground.]

<Kagome:    tsuide ni KUUKI YOminasai yo.>
Kagome: In addition, pay attention to the situation.
<Sango:    tsuide na no ka.>
Sango: .oO(In addition, huh?).

5
[Inside the house, the 4 are sitting around the fire.]
<headman:    IKKOKU mo HAYAku, MUSUME to SHUUGEN o agete itadakitai no desu ga.>
headman: I wish to have the wedding ceremony as soon as possible.
<Miroku:    shikashi, SHIMA-dono o NERAtte iru MIZUUMI no NUSHI wa YOUKAI deshou.>

<headman:    soko na no desu.>
headman: that's the point.

3
[The father explains something to Miroku.]
<headman:    MIZUUMI no NUSHI-SAMA wa KIYOraka na OTOME o YOME ni HOshii to...>
headman: The nushi-sama of the lake said he wanted a pure girl for a bride...
<headman:    desu kara, SHUUGEN o agete shimaeba akiramete kureru mono to.>
headman: Therefor, once we've had the ceremony, he'll probably give up.
<Miroku:    sore wa mata RICHIGI na.
** this doesn't make any sense. Guessing below.
>
Miroku: That doesn't help either.

4
[Shima turns to Miroku, imploringly.]

Shima: Please, before the nushi-sama comes, let me become your wife, Miroku-sama...
<Miroku:    SHIMA-dono.>

5
[The headman makes a comment, which seems to embarrass Miroku slightly.]
<headman:    SUeZEN KUwanu wa OTOKO no HAJI daro.>
headman: "Shame on a man who does not accept a woman's proposition".
<Miroku:    ha_ha_ha, iyaa...>
