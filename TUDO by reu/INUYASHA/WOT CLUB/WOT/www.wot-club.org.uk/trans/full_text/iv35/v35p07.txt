Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

Kagome: It's obvious [Sango] doesn't feel good about [Miroku's] old girlfriend turning up.

(    What Kagome says isn't quite so specific as I've shown above, hence the
brackets, but that's the implication. Could apply the same line to Inuyasha
and Kagome, regarding Kikyou...)

<Kagome:    MIROKU-sama to MUSUbareta tte no wa, Uso datta no!?>

Page 17

[Shima explains.]
<Shima:    hai.>
Shima: Yes.
<Shima:    Namazu no YOME ni naritaku nakatta no de, tsui...>

<Miroku:    SHIMA-dono wa, tossa ni CHIE o HATARAkaseta no deshou.>
Miroku: Shima-dono made quick use of her wit.
<Sango:    so, sonna koto nara...>

3
[Closeup of Miroku.]
<Miroku:    WATASHI wa omae ni amaete ita no da.>

<Miroku:    Iwazu tomo wkatte ite kureru to...>
Miroku: That you'd understand without me telling you...

4
[Sango looks a bit surprised.]
<Sango:    HOUSHI-sama...>
Sango: Houshi-sama...

5
[View of the pair.]
<Miroku:    WATASHI no HIGORO no OKONAi ga WARUi sei da na.>
Miroku: It'd been a bad habbit of mine for a long time.
<Miroku:    iya na OMOi o sasete sumanakatta SANGO.>

Sango: ......

6
[Sango starts looking a bit apologetic.]
<Sango:    mou ii yo.>

<Sango:    sore ni... TASUkete moratta TOKI...>

<Sango:    atashi no HOU koso.>
Sango: If you can forgive me.
<Inuyasha:    ii no ka.>
Inuyasha: Are you sure?
<Kagome:    SANGO-chan, KOKORO ga HIROi yo ne.>

[White frame. Scene change.]

3
[View of the sky.]
<Shippou:    demo ne-,>
Shippou: {off} But you know,
<Shippou:    yappari motto HAYAku HITEIshitokeba anna koto ni wa...>
Shippou: it would have been better to deny it right away...

4
[The group is walking along, with Sango and Miroku together in front, with
Shippou, Kagome and Inuyasha behind.]
<Shippou:    moshiya KIOKU no IOTO o taguru no ni JIKAN ga kakatta no dewa nai ka?>
Shippou: Could it be that it took you a while to unwind your thread of memory?
Fx Miroku: erk <giku>

(    The implication being that Miroku was confusing other things he'd done in
the past with what he'd done with Shima...)

5
[Sango looks like she's about to choke Miroku, who has a "it's all a
missunderstanding expression". ]
<Shippou:    ZUBOSHI ka.>
Shippou: Bullseye eh.
<Sango:    sou na no?>
Sango: Is that so?
<Sango:    e? sou na no?>
Sango: Eh? Is that so?
Fx Miroku: grind grind <Giri Giri Giri>
<Miroku:    nanibun MUKASHI no koto desu kara...>
Miroku: Well, it was some time ago and...
