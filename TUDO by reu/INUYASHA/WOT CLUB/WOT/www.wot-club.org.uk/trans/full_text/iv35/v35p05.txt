Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

Fx air: shh... <Zaa...>

[Closeup of Sesshoumaru...]
<Sesshoumaru:    NARAKU no SHINZOU no ari ka... da to?>
Sesshoumaru: Where Naraku's heart is located... hmm?

3
[Closeup of Kagura.]
<Kagura:    aa.>
Kagura: Yeah.
<Kagura:    SESSHOUMARU... anta mo KIzute-ru daro.>
Kagura: Sesshoumaru... you've noticed it too, haven't you.

4
[Drawing of Naraku's body being ripped apart.]
<Kagura:    NARAKU wa NANDO KARADA o KUDAitemo SHInanee.>
Kagura: That no matter how often you smash Naraku's body, he won't die.

5
[Similar drawing of Hakudoushi.]
<Kagura:    NARAKU no BUNSHIN, HAKUDOUSHI tte Gaki mo DOUYOU da.>
Kagura: That brat Hakudoushi, Naraku's offspring, is the same.

[Closeup of Kagura.]
<Kagura:    INOCHI ni KAKAwaru BUBUN...>

3
[Closeup side view of Sesshoumaru.]
<Kagura:    sou wa OMOwanee ka?>
Kagura: {off} Don't you think so?

4
[Behind Sesshoumaru, Jaken plays his part of loyal henchman.]
<Jaken:    SESSHOUMARU-sama, oKI o tsukekudasai.>
Jaken: Sesshoumaru-sama, please be careful.
<Jaken:    WANA kamo shire masen zo.>
Jaken: This may be a trap.

5
[Closeup of Kagura looking slightly distainful.]
<Kagura:    WANAa?>
Kagura: A trap?

6
[Jaken continues yabbering at Kagura.]
<Jaken:    KAGURA_,>
Jaken: Kagura!
<Jaken:    kisama to te NARAKU no BUNSHIN de arou ga_.>
Jaken: You're the offspring of Naraku too, aren't you!
<Jaken:    sonna yatsu no Iu koto ga SHINYOU dekiru ka.>
Jaken: How could we possibly trust anything you say huh?
Kagura: ......

[Kagura reaches into her clothes while talking.]
<Kagura:    fun... SHINjiru SHINjinai wa KATTE daga...>
Kagura: Humph... Whether you believe me or not is up to you, but...

2
[Kagura holds up a dark crystal.]
<Kagura:    kore wa MOtte-temo SON wa nee ze.>
Kagura: it'd be in your best interests to take this.

3
[Jaken looks on, suspiciously.]
<Jaken:    nan jai sore wa.>
Jaken: What is that?

4
[Closeup side view of Kagura.]
<Kagura:    YOUKI no KESSHOU da.>
Kagura: A crystal of _Youki_.

5
[Drawing of the black ball baby Naraku carries.]
<Kagura:    NARAKU no YAROU wa SAIKIN,>
Kagura: Recently, that jerk Naraku,
<Kagura:    YOUKI o KAKUsu MAMOri ISHI, FUYOUHEKI... tte no o TE ni Ireta.>
Kagura: got his hands on the _Youki_ concealing protective stone... called Fuyouheki.
<Kagura:    osoraku, SHINZOU no arika o KAKUJITSU ni KAKusu tame da.>
Kagura: Most likely, it is to make certain the location of his heart is concealed.

6
[Closeup of the _Youki_ crystal.]
<Kagura:    soshite kono YOUKI no KESSHOU wa,>
Kagura: And this crystal of _Youki_,
<Kagura:    FUYOUHEKI ni CHIKAzuku to YOUKI o USHINAu.>
Kagura: will lose its _Youki_ when it gets near to Fuyouheki.
<Kagura:    NARAKU no SHINZOU o SAGAsu TEgakari tte wake da.>
Kagura: So it is a clue to finding Naraku's heart.

[Closeup side view of Sesshoumaru.]
<Sesshoumaru:    KAGURA kisama,>
Sesshoumaru: Kagura,
<Sesshoumaru:    kono SESSHOUMARU o TSUKAu KI ka.>
Sesshoumaru: you plan to make use of me, huh.

2
[Closeup side view of Kagura looking serious.]
Kagura: ......
<Kagura:    anta hodo no UTSUWA denakerya NARAKU o KOROsenai.>
Kagura: Without someone of your quality, killing Naraku would be impossible.

3
[View of Rin, looking on a bit wide-eyed.]
<Kagura:    UDEMAE mo YOURYOKU mo,>
Kagura: Both skill and Youkai-power,
<Kagura:    anta no MIGI ni DEru MONO wa inai kara ne.
** "migi ni deru mono wa inai" ?? Guessing...
>
Kagura: there is nobody who can compare to you.

4
[Closeup of Jaken looking angry.]
<Jaken:    ho...>
Jaken: .oO("Pr...).
<Jaken:    homeGOROshi!>
Jaken: .oO("Praise to death"!).

(    A tricky word to translate - homegoroshi. Simplest way of translating it is
"praise to death" and basically means to praise an enemy so much, they act
carelessly, leading to their doom.)

5
[Kagura puts the crystal down in front of Sesshoumaru.]
<Kagura:    kore wa Oite iu ze.>
Kagura: I'll leave this here.

6
[Closeup of the crystal.]
<Kagura:    ato wa nata no JIYUU da.>
Kagura: The rest is up to you.

[Jaken and Sesshoumaru watch her leave.]
<Jaken:    ano ONNA...>
Jaken: That woman...
Sesshoumaru: ......

1
[Jaken looks down at the crystal.]
<Jaken:    na~ni ga YOUKI no KESSHOU da.>
Jaken: Crystal of _Youki_ huh? Humph!
<Jaken:    SESSHOUMARU-sama, ikaga itashi masu?>
Jaken: Sesshoumaru-sama, what should we do?

2
[Jaken notices that Sesshoumaru is walking off.]
<Jaken:    SESSHOUMARU-sama!?>
Jaken: Sesshoumaru-sama!?
Fx Sesshoumaru: shh <Za_>
<Sesshoumaru:    JAKEN.>
Sesshoumaru: Jaken.
<Sesshoumaru:    omae ni makaseru.>
Sesshoumaru: I'll leave it to you.

<Jaken:    tte...>
Jaken: Er, so...
<Jaken:    do surya ii n-da?>

Fx Jaken: *dither dither* <oro oro>

4
[Rin comes over to discuss it with Jaken.]
<Rin:    MOtte-ta HOU ga ii n-ja nai?>
Rin: Shouldn't we take it with us?
<Jaken:    so, sou kaa?>
Jaken: Y, you think so?

5
[Closeup of Rin.]
<Rin:    datte KAGURA tte HITO,>
Rin: Well, that Kagura woman,
<Rin:    SESSHOUMARU-sama o damasou to shite-ru KANji ja nakatta mon.>
Rin: didn't seem to me like she was trying to fool Sesshoumaru-sama.

6
[Rin continues talking to Jaken.]
<Rin:    kitto SESSHOUMARU-sama no koto ga SUki nan da yo.>
Rin: She is probably in love with Sesshoumaru-sama.
<Jaken:    haa?>
Jaken: Huh?

7
[Rin continues making her point, and Jaken suddenly seems very tired.]
<Rin:    hora, suggoi homete-ta shi.>
Rin: Come on, she _really_ praised him.
<Jaken:    TANJUN jana~ kono Gaki wa.>
Jaken: .oO(This kid sure is simple.).
Fx Jaken: *si-i-igh* <haa>

[Closeup of Sesshoumaru.]
<Sesshoumaru:    YOUKI o KAKUsu MAMOri ISHI... ka.>
Sesshoumaru: .oO(A _Youki_ concealing protective stone... huh.).

2
[Misty frame. Scene change.]

3
[The group is walking along, with Inuyasha and Kagome at the front, Shippou
and Kirara in the middle, and Sango and Miroku at the back.]
<Miroku:    haa~>
Miroku: Si~i~gh
<Kagome:    MIROKU-sama, mada Ochikonde-ru.>
Kagome: Miroku-sama's still depressed.
<Inuyasha:    YOUKI no KESSHOU o kasumeTOrareta koto ka~?>
Inuyasha: Because of the crystal of _Youki_ was stolen from him?

4
[View of Miroku (looking depressed) and Sango (looking at Miroku in concern)]
<Miroku:    mattaku WATASHI to shita koto ga.>
Miroku: I really am entirely to blame.
<Sango:    shikatanai yo. sore yori...>
Sango: There was no avoiding it. Besides...

5
[Closeup of Sango, looking down at the ground.]
<Sango:    HOUSHI-sama ni Kega ga nakute, HONTOU ni yokatta.>
Sango: I'm just really glad that you weren't injured, houshi-sama.

6
[Closeup of Miroku, looking at Sango with a dreamy background.]
<Miroku:    SANGO...>
Miroku: Sango...
Fx Miroku: *emotionally moved...* <jii~~n>



Page 8

[Miroku has now clasped Sango's hands.]
<Miroku:    amari YASAshii KOTOBA o kakete kureru na.
** kinda guessing what Miroku means here.
>
Miroku: Please don't be so kind to me...
Fx Miroku: *squeeze* <Kyu>
<Sango:    HOUSHI-sama...>
Sango: Houshi-sama...

2
[Miroku is now hugging Sango close, with his right hand on her bottom.]
<Miroku:    WATASHI wa JIBUN no UKATSUsa ga HURUsen no da.>
Miroku: As I can't forgive my own carelessness.
Fx Miroku: *stroke stroke* <nade nade>
<Sango:    chotto...>
Sango: Umm, hey...
<Inuyasha:    are, Ochikonde-ru ka?>
Inuyasha: Isn't he supposed to be depressed?
<Kagome:    Itte-ru koto to yatte-ru koto, Barabara da shi...>
Kagome: What he's saying and what he's doing is messed up for a start...
Fx Shippou: *sta~a~are* <Ji~~>

3
[View of some clouds. Scene change.]

4
[A middle villager is standing tentatively before what appears to be a small
shrine beside a lake. Two other men are standing behind him, looking even
more nervous.]
<villager:    danna-SAMA, Bachi ga Ataranee desu ka?>
villager: Danna-sama, are you sure we won't get retribution?
<headman:    KONDO koso DAIJOUBU ja.>
headman: This time for sure it'll be okay.

(    "Danna-sama" is kind of a basic respectful title. So this guy is probably a
bit above the average peasant around here - probably village headman or something.)

[Closeup of the man, who is holding a piece of paper.]
<headman:    kore wa TOKU no TAKAi oBOUSAMA ni itadaita oFUDA...>
headman: This is an o-fuda I received from a high-ranking priest...
<headman:    kore ni te...>
headman: With this...

2
[The man puts the o-fuda onto the front of the small shrine.]
<headman:    oSHIZUmari kudasare_.>
headman: Please be calm!
Fx paper: *placed* <peta>

3
[Closeup of the piece of paper, which crackles with energy.]
Fx energy: crackle <Pachi Pachi>

4
[The shine starts shaking.]
Fx shrine: rattle rattle <Gata Gata Gata>

5
[The ground starts shaking too.]
Fx shrine: rattle rattle <Gata Gata>
Fx water: thud thud <Dodododo>
<villager:    hi_.>
villager: Yeek!

6
[The scene shifts back to Inuyasha and co walking through a forest.]
Fx leaves: rustle rustle <Zawa Zawa>
<Miroku:    n? JISHIN?>
Miroku: Hm? An earth-quake?
<Kagome:    sore ni...>
Kagome: But in addition...



Page 10
1
[Miroku and Sango rush forwards.]
<Miroku:    YOUKI desu na!>
Miroku: There's _Youki_ here!
<Sango:    Ikou!>
Sango: Let's go!
Fx Sango and Miroku: *dash* <Da_>

2
[The group reaches the lake to find the villagers grovelling before the shrine.]
<villager:    oYURUshi kudasai.>
villager: Please forgive us.
<headman:    oYURUshi kudasai NUSHI-SAMA!>
headman: Please forgive us, nushi-sama!

(    "Nushi" is like "owner" or "master".)

3
[Closeup of the shrine - the o-fuda has blackened and is fading away.]
Fx o-fuda: sizzle... <Ju--->

4
[Miroku and Inuyasha arrive behind the headman.]
Fx Inuyasha: shh <Za_>
<Miroku:    dounasai mashita!?>
Miroku: What happened!?

5
[Closeup of Miroku.]
<Miroku:    nanika KAII ni KURUshinde orareru goYOUSU.>
Miroku: It seems you have suffering from some strange events.
<Miroku:    WATASHI-domo de yokereba oCHIKARA ni..>
Miroku: If you don't mind, we chould help you...

6
[Closeup of the headman, looking a bit surprised.]
<headman:    mi...>
headman: Mi...
<headman:    MIROKU HOUSHI-sama...?>
headman: Miroku houshi-sama...?

7
[Miroku looks a bit surprised.]
<Miroku:    ha?>
Miroku: Huh?



Page 11
1
[The man suddenly turns around to face Miroku, though he is still crouched
on the ground.]
Fx headman: fwip <gaba_>
<headman:    yahari MIROKU HOUSHI-sama.>
headman: It is you, Miroku houshi-sama.
<headman:    YAKUSOKU-doori MUKOIri ni KIte kudasareta no ka.>
headman: As you promised, you have come for the mukoiri haven't you.

(    More fun Japanese words: "mukoiri" means becoming the heir of the wife's
family. Maybe the best english translation would be "As you promised, you
have come to marry my daughter (and heir) haven't you.")

2
[Suddenly, Miroku is the center of attention - Kagome in particular is
giving him a cold look. Miroku seems confused.]
<Kagome:    MUKOIri...?>
Kagome: Mukoiri...?
Fx Kagome: *glare* <jiro>

3
[View of the village.]
<headman:    MIROKU-sama ga MODOrareta_.>
headman: {off} Miroku-sama has returned!
<headman:    omotenashi no YOUI o_.>
headman: Prepare a feast!

4
[A bit later, the group is now in a room, seated around a fire.]
<Kagome:    dou iu koto na no?>
Kagome: What is the situation?
<Miroku:    hate...>
Miroku: Well...
<Sango:    OBOetenai no?>
Sango: You don't remember?
<Inuyasha:    ke_, OMOiAtaru koto ga OOsugiru n-daro.>
Inuyasha: Bah! Too many possibilities I bet.



Page 12
1
[Suddenly a pretty girl appears in the doorway - she's about Kagome's age,
and pretty cute. She has some tears in her eyes and is smiling happily.]
Fx girl: tmp <Ta_>
<girl:    MIROKU-sama.>
girl: Miroku-sama.
<girl:    oMAchishite ori mashita.>
girl: I've been waiting all this time.

2
[Miroku makes the classic "I've got it" kind of action - slapping his fist
into his other palm. Yup, Miroku completely forgot the parents and the
area, but remembers the girl instantly.]
Fx Miroku: clap <pon>

3
[Miroku suddenly rushes ahead and clasps the girl's hands, smiling.]
<Miroku:    SHIMA-dono.>
Miroku: Shima-dono.
<Miroku:    UTSUKUshiku natta na.>
Miroku: You sure have become beautiful.

Fx Miroku: ah... <ha_...>

2
[Sango is now standing behind Miroku, who looks rather tense.]
Fx Sango: *gaining intensity* <suu_>
<Miroku:    Ochitsuke.>
Miroku: Calm down.

3
[Closeup of Sango with a flat expression, though the background is dangerous.]
<Sango:    MUKASHI no koto nan daro?>
Sango: It's about something that happened long ago, right?

4
[The headman and his wife are now at the door.]
<headman:    hai.>
headman: Indeed.
<headman:    WATASHI-domo FUUFU mo, MUKASHI no koto to akiramete ori mashita.>
headman: Way back then, both my wife and I had given up hope.

5
[Flash back drawing to the man and his wife, sitting beside a younger Shima,
who is lying in bed, looking weak.]
<headman:    MUSUME no SHIMA wa YOUSHOU no KORO kara KARADA ga YOWAku,>
headman: {voice over} From when she was a baby, our daughter Shima has had a weak body,
<headman:    MAKURA kara ATAMA no agaru HI ga ari masen deshita.>
headman: There wasn't a day when she would raise her head from her pillow.

6
[Flashback drawing of Miroku, looking not too different from how he looks now.]
<headman:    soko ni MIROKU HOUSHI-sama ga TOOri kakarareta no desu.>
headman: {voice over} Then it happened that Miroku houshi-sama was passing by.
<headman:    NI NEN MAE no koto de gozai mashita.>
headman: This happened 2 years ago.
<Miroku:    sore wa oKOMAri deshou.>
Miroku: {flash back} That certainly is a shame.

Miroku: {flash back} Every day, boil these herbs in clean water, and drink it.

2
[Closeup of the father, smiling back on his memories.]
<headman:    sasuga ni KOUKA na YAKUSOU dake atte...>
headman: Just what you'd expect from just using top grade herbs...

3
[View of the group - the parents look pleased, Shima is smiling, and Sango
and Inuyasha are giving Miroku a dark look.]
<headman:    yoku KIki mashita.>
headman: as they worked so well.
<mother:    hon ni KOUKA na oKUSURI deshita na.>
mother: It sure was an effective medicine.
Fx Shima: *refreshed* <tsuya tsuya>
<Inuyasha and Sango:    bottakutta na...>
Inuyasha and Sango: He cheated them, didn't he...

4
[Kagome looks at Miroku.]
<Kagome:    de, sono mama NAKAYOku natta n-da.>
Kagome: So, is that when you became friends?
<Miroku:    ie...>
Miroku: No...

5
[View of Shima and Miroku.]
<Shima:    MIROKU-sama wa OKUSURI o kudasaru to, SOUSOU ni SArare mashita.>
Shima: Miroku-sama left shortly after giving me the medicine.
<Miroku:    gorannasai.>
Miroku: {To Sango etc} There, you see.
<Miroku:    WATASHI wa KEPPAKU desu.>
Miroku: I did no wrong.



Page 15
1
[A flash back to Miroku holding Shima's hands, and her smiling happily.]
<Miroku:    GENKI ni nattara WATASHI no KO o Unde kureru ka?>
Miroku: If you get better, would you please bear my child?
<Shima:    hai_.>
Shima: Yes!

2
[Back in the present, in the foreground, Shima is clasping her hands in joy,
surrounded by sparkles. Behind her, Kagome is glaring at Miroku, who has
just been hit on the head by Sango's boomerang - she has a kind of annoyed,
flat expression.]
<Shima:    KOUKA na oKUSURI to,>
Shima: With the effective medicine,
<Shima:    WAKAre GIWA no MIROKU-sama no oYAKUSOKU o KOKORO no SAKAe ni,>
Shima: and Miroku-sama's parting promise to lift my heart,
<Shima:    sukkari GENKI ni nari mashita.>
Shima: I completely recovered.
<Kagome:    yappari KUDOite n-ja nai no_.>
Kagome: As I suspected, you did seduce her!
<Sango:    ii yo. MUKASHI no koto nan daro?>
Sango: It's okay. It's about something that happened long ago, right?
Fx Miroku: clunk... <mishi...>

3
[Closeup of Inuyasha looking annoyed.]
<Inuyasha:    _taku kudaranee.>
Inuyasha: Sheesh, how pathetic.
<Inuyasha:    do- demo ii ja nee ka sonna HANASHI.>
Inuyasha: This conversation doesn't matter at all.

4
[Kagome gets a bit angry with Inuyasha.]
<Kagome:    yoka- nai desho.>
Kagome: It does matter!
<Inuyasha:    KAII no HANASHI wa dou natte n-da yo.>
Inuyasha: What about the strange event earlier!

5

<Kagome:    ma, mata JISHIN.>
Kagome: An, another earthquake.

3
[Shima clings to Miroku's chest in fear. Miroku looks a bit worried. He
should be - right behind him Sango has angry flames around her, and looks furious.]
Fx house: clatter clatter <Gata Gata Gata>
Fx Shima: *cling* <hishi_>
<Shima:    kowai, MIROKU-sama.>
Shima: I'm scared, Miroku-sama.
Fx Sango: (veins) *snap snap snap* <piki piki piki>
Fx Sango: (angry frames) ro-a-a-r <Go--->
<Miroku:    WATASHI mo BETSU no IMA de kowai.>
Miroku: .oO(I'm also scared, but for a different reason.).

4
[Miroku talks to Shima's parents.]
Fx house: clatter clatter <Gata Gata>
Fx headman: *bow* <gaba>
<headman:    MIROKU HOUSHI-sama.>
headman: Miroku houshi-sama.
<headman:    douka oTASUke kudasai.>
headman: Please save us.
<mother:    kono mama dewa MUSUME ga YOUKAI no HANAYOME ni...>
mother: At this rate, our daughter will have to become a Youkai's bride...
<Miroku:    YOUKAI no HANAYOME?>
Miroku: A Youkai's bride?

[Drawing of the lake and small shrine from earlier.]

headman: Y, yes.
<headman:    ano HOKORA wa MIZUUMI no NUSHI-SAMA o oMATSUri shitamono.>

2
[View of the man.]
<headman:    sono NUSHI-sama ga, doushitemo SHIMA o YOME ni yokose to...>
headman: That nushi-sama is insistent on Shima becoming his bride...

3
[Shima talks to Miroku.]
<Shima:    WATASHI ni wa IINAZUKE ga iru to Ittemo SHINjite moraezu...>
Shima: Even though I told him I had a fiancee, he didn't believe me...
<Miroku:    ano~>
Miroku: Umm...
<Miroku:    IINAZUKE to wa...?>
Miroku: By fiancee, you mean...?
<Sango:    anta no koto desho_.>
Sango: That's you of course.

4
[Closeup of Shima looking very happy, while behind her, her parents look
very relieved.]
<Shima:    demo MIROKU-sama wa, WATASHI no YAKUSOKU o WASUrezu ni MODOtte kite kudasatta.>
Shima: But Miroku-sama has returned because he hasn't forgotten his promise to me.
<Shima:    donna ni kono HI o MAchiNOZOnda koto ka.>
Shima: Oh, how I've waited for this day.

[Closeup of Miroku looking serious.]
<Miroku:    wakari mashita. tonikaku,>
Miroku: I understand. At any rate,
<Miroku:    SHIMA-dono o YOUKAI ni WATAsu wake ni ikan.>
Miroku: there is no way I will hand over Shima-dono to a Youkai.

2
[The headman looks very pleased.]
<headman:    oTASUke itadake masu ka.>
headman: You will save us!?
<Miroku:    omakase kudasai.>
Miroku: Leave it to me.

3
[Miroku suddenly looks uncertain.]
<headman:    dewa sassoku SHUUGEN o_.>
headman: Right, let's hold the wedding ceremony right away!
