Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

<villager:    de... DEta.>
villager: I... it came out.

(    In Japanese, the verb "deru" (to come out) or "deta" (it came out) in these
kinds of circumstances can refer to a monster or ghost appearing. In manga
or anime, when a ghost suddenly appears the characters will often scream
"deta-a-a". However, it's hard to translate.)

of Buddhist clothes, which actually look somewhat dirty. Each is carrying
something like a large set of bag-pipes - a large sack which has a handle
and a funnel (out of which the streams of light probably come). The boys
are all wearing masks over most of their faces, covering their eyes.]
Fx air: shhht... <Shu-->
Fx group: sh... <Zaa>

[View of what look like stone buddhist priests. They look more like people
who have been turned to stone than carved out of rock. Definitely something
wrong about this place.]

[View of the dark sky.]
<Gyouja:    GORYOUMARU-sama-.>
