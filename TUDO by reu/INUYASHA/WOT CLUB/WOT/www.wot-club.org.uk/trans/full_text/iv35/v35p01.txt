Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

other. Kagome looks on, a bit surprised.]
Fx heads: bomp <go_>
<Inuyasha:    ou, nan no SAWAgi da.>
Inuyasha: Ooh, what's all the fuss.
<Kouga:    aa?>
Kouga: Ahh?
<Kouga:    nande temee to SAKI ni KUCHIKIkanakya nanee n-da.>
Kouga: Why do I have to talk to you first?

[Sango and Miroku look at the dead monster.]
<Sango:    HOUSHI-sama kore wa...>
Sango: Houshi-sama, this is...
<Miroku:    aa, MIta tokoro IRIIRO na YOUKAI no YOseATSUme da na.>

[Closeup of Miroku.]
<Miroku:    are wa HAKU da na.>
Miroku: Those are "haku" (spirits).

2
[Inuyasha and Kouga pay attention.]
<Inuyasha:    HAKU?>
Inuyasha: Haku?
<Kouga:    nanda sorya.>
Kouga: What's that.

3
[View of Miroku.]
<Miroku:    NINGEN mo KEMONO mo YOUKAI mo,>
Miroku: Humans, beasts and Youkai,
<Miroku:    TAINAI ni KON to HAKU o MOtte iru.>
Miroku: all have "kon" and "haku" inside their bodies.

4
[View of the dead monster.]
<Miroku:    KON wa KOKORO... tsumari TAMASHII da.>
Miroku: "Kon" is the heart... in other words, the soul.
<Miroku:    soshite "haku" wa KARADA o UGOkasu CHIKARA...>
Miroku: And "haku" is the power that moves the body...
<Miroku:    kono YOUKAI, SHInde KON ga NUketa ATO...>
Miroku: This Youkai, died and after its "kon" left...

5
[Closeup side view of Miroku.]
<Miroku:    HAKU dake de UGOite ita rashii na.>
Miroku: it seems only its "haku" was moving it.

6
[Closeup of Miroku.]
<Inuyasha:    tsumari...>
Inuyasha: In other words...
<Inuyasha:    HAKU tte yatsu ga areba, TAMASHII no nai SHIGAI demo UGOku n-da na.>
Inuyasha: so long as it has this "haku" stuff, a corpse can move without a soul.

[Closeup side view of Kouga.]
<Kouga:    nanni shitatte FUTSUU ja nee.>
Kouga: At any rate, it's not normal.
<Kouga:    DAREka ga koitsu o AYATSUtte-ta tte koto ka.>
Kouga: Maybe someone was controlling this thing.

2
[Kagome looks on, and Kouga suddenly puts an arm around her shoulder (which
she doesn't react to) but Inuyasha's face darkens.]
<Kagome:    NARAKU ga KAKAwatte iru no kashira.>
Kagome: I wonder if Naraku is involved.
Fx Kouga: (Kagome) *hug* <gu_>
<Kouga:    aa.>
Kouga: Yeah.
<Kouga:    usanKUSEe na.>

[Kouga and Inuyasha are now glaring at each other almost touching foreheads again.]
<Kouga:    nandei INU_koro.>
Kouga: What with you, dog-turd?
<Inuyasha:    temee nani Futsu- ni KATA DAite n-da.>
Inuyasha: What're you hugging her shoulder as if it's normal for?

5
[Kouga responds, and Inuyasha snaps again.]
<Kouga:    Fsutsu- daro. HOreta DOUSHI ga HISAshiburi ni Atta n-da.>
Kouga: It's normal isn't it? For mutual lovers who haven't met in a long time.
Fx Inuyasha: *crack knuckles* <baki>
<Inuyasha:    DARE ga HOreta DOUSHI da, KOROsu zo temee.>
Inuyasha: Who the heck are mutual lovers! I'll kill you.
<Kagome:    yamenasai yo INUYASHA.>
Kagome: Stop that Inuyasha.

[Inuyasha shouts angrily at Kagome, who reacts calmly.]
<Inuyasha:    yakamashii.>
Inuyasha: You shut up.
<Inuyasha:    daitai omae ga so-yu- AIMAI na TAIDO yoru nara, kono Baka ga tsukeagaru n-da.>
Inuyasha: In the first place, this idiot is taking advantage of that ambiguous attitude of yours. 
<Kagome:    haa?>
Kagome: Huh?

2
[Closeup of Kagome responding calmly.]
<Kagome:    anta ga sore o Iu?>
Kagome: How can you say that?

3
[View of the two talking.]
<Inuyasha:    nandei.>
Inuyasha: Why?
<Kagome:    JIBUN to KIKYOU no koto wa TANA ni agete,>
Kagome: You're blind to how you affect me when you're with Kikyou,
<Kagome:    WATASHI no koto OKOru n-da.>
Kagome: which makes me angry.

4
[Inuyasha stays silent, and the others look on.]
Inuyasha: ......
<Shippou:    oo_ DAMAtta zo.>
Shippou: OOh! He's shut up.
<Sango:    HANRON no shiyou ga nai mon na.>
Sango: He can't object to it can he.

5
[Sweating a bit, Inuyasha responds and Kagome gives him a cool expression.]
<Inuyasha:    ore wa KIKYOU no KATA to ka DAitenee zo.>
Inuyasha: I've never hugged Kikyou's shoulder or something.
<Kagome:    sou iu koto Itte-ru n-ja nai wa yo.>

<Kagome:    nan no yo mou_.>
Kagome: Sheesh, what's with you!
<Kagome:    KIKYOU to Au tabi ni FUTARI no SEKAI TSUKUchatte.>
Kagome: When you meet Kikyou you go into your own little word.
<Kagome:    WATASHI ga ENRYOshite-ru kara tte AMAe n-ja nai wa yo.>
Kagome: Just because I restrain myself, it doesn't mean you can take me for granted!

2
[Kagome turns away from Inuyasha.]
<Inuyasha:    omae yappa NE ni MOtte...>
Inuyasha: So you are holding a grudge...
<Kagome:    osuwari.>
Kagome: Sit.

3
[Kagome is now angrily pointing at Inuyasha who is plastered to the ground.
Kouga looks on with a smile.]
<Inuyasha:    ya~ma~ro~>
Inuyasha: St~o~o~p th~a~at
Fx Inuyasha: thump thump <Do Do Do Do>
<Kagome:    osuwari osuwari osuwari_.>
Kagome: Sit, sit, sit!
<Kouga:    fu_.>
Kouga: Heh.

4
[Kouga looks on with a big gloating expression. His two friends look at him
as if he's missing the plot.]
<Kouga:    zamaa mi yagare.>
Kouga: Suck on that.
<Kouga:    INU_koro no YAROU, kagome ni OMOi_kiri KIRAwarete n-ja nee ka.>
Kouga: That dumb dog-turd, Kagome completely hates him doesn't she.
<wolf-man patch:    ...te yu- ka KOUGA.>
wolf-man patch: .oO(...But Kouga...).
<wolf-man spike:    KANZEN ni MUSHIsarete n-ja nee no?>
wolf-man spike: .oO(Isn't she completely ignoring you?).

<Kouga:    ore wa Iku ze.>
Kouga: I'm leaving.

Miroku: The pieces of Youkai are spread in every direction.
<Sango:    aa.>
Sango: Yeah.
<Sango:    HAKU de UGOku YOUKAI mo, kono IPPIKI dake to wa OMOenai shi ne.>

Kouga: Huh? Who the hell are you.

3
[View of Hakudoushi. A large figure can now been seen behind him - about 10
times taller than Hakudoushi though it's crouched down. It's the cleanest
and most human looking monster yet, though it still has spikes around it's
shoulders and forearms and has some dark patterning. It's ("his" face
really) is pointing down. It looks fast and lethal.]
