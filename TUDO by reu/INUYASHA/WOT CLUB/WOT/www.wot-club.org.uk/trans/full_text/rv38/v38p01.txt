Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 12 chapters long, costing 400 yen) when they become available
(typically 3-4 months after the weekly Shonen Sunday release), of
which all 38 volumes are on sale.


Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

[The doors to the pipe closes, and the man drags Akane back from the closed doors.]

Akane: Think you've caught me, huh!!
<man:    aiya-, oKYAKU-san WATASHI SEIGI no MIKATA.>
man: Aiya, o-kyaku-san, I'm on the side of justice.

(    'Aiya' is a typical expression used by Chinese people in Ranma 1/2, and
'o-kyaku-san' is a polite term for 'customer' or 'guest'. The Jusenkyou
Guide and his daughter Plum tend to use this.)
