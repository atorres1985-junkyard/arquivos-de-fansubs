Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 12 chapters long, costing 400 yen) when they become available
(typically 3-4 months after the weekly Shonen Sunday release), of
which all 38 volumes are on sale.


Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

the old man.]

(    Jokezzoku is the name for Shampoo's tribe/clan, which (according to my
dictionary anyway) would translate as 'heroine-tribe', though is normally
done as 'Amazons'.)
