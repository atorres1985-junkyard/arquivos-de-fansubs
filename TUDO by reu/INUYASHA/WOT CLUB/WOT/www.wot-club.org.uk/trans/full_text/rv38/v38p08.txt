Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 12 chapters long, costing 400 yen) when they become available
(typically 3-4 months after the weekly Shonen Sunday release), of
which all 38 volumes are on sale.


Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

<Mousse:    moshiya Safuran wa UtareYOWAi no dewa nai ka!?>
Mousse: Couldn't it be that Saffron's weak at taking a hit!?
<Ryouga:    CHIGAi nee_, SOKKIN ni chiyahoyasarete SODAtta to suru to...>

Ranma: No doubt about it!
<Ranma:    Safuran wa TANJUN na NAGUru KEru no KOUGEKI ni YOWAi!!>
Ranma: Saffron is weak to simple physical attacks!!

(    A more precise translation would be "They're basic, but Saffron is weak to
punch and kick attacks.")



Page 9

[Using the staff of the Gekkaja to swing on, Ranma spins his body swinging
both feet into Saffron's head.]
<Ranma:    kurae-_, CHOKUSETSU SHUUDA RYUUSEI KYAKU!!>

[Some magma splurts up.]
Fx magma: glub-glub<Gobo Gobo Gobo>



Page 11

Ryouga: The heat radiation earlier is no match to that now!

4
[Saffron, though indistinct due to the extreme heat, floats up from the bottom.]
<Saffron:    fu_.>
Saffron: Heh.



Page 12

[Saffron is now up at Ranma's height in the tornado, and emitting a very
large white glow, so bright Saffron is almost colourless. Ranma's clothes
are smoking, and the block of ice at the end of the Gekkaja has mostly melted.]

<Ranma:    kore IJOU TATAKAi ga NAGAbiittara ore mo akane mo...>
Ranma: .oO(If the battle gets drawn out any longer, both Akane and I will...).

3
[Saffron radiates an huge amount of light and energy.]
<Saffron:    HOUOUSAN OUZOKU KYUUKYOKU OUGI!!>
Saffron: Mt Phoenix Royal Family's Ultimate Ultra-level attack!!
Fx light: flash <Ka_>

(    Special moves and terms relating to them can be a bit hard to translate
into sensible sounding english. Here, "kyuukyoku ougi" was translated as
"Ultimate Ultra-level attack". Often a 'school' of a particular type of
Martial Arts (or similar) will have an attack classed as an 'ougi' - as
'final' level, or ultimate level attack. It may refer to a single
particular attack, but can refer to a set of attacks in general, which is
why Saffron says 'kyuukyoku' ('ultimate') as well - ie it's the best of his
highest level attacks. Or, putting it another way, he doesn't have anything
stronger. Note - this is just announcing the classification of the attack -
that comes next...)

4
[Ranma looks on in fear.]
<Ranma:    NETSUKYUU!>

Fx fireball:  <mo **??>

4
[Ryouga and the others look on in shock.]
<Ryouga:    a...>
Ryouga: Ah...



Page 14

[The blast fires off into a beam, melting the tops off some thin mountain
peaks. (Do you really get geography like this?)]
Fx tornado: who-o-sh <Go--->
Fx mountain tops: *melt* <Ju_>

2
[Ryouga and Mousse are shocked.]
<Mousse:    YAMA ga KIeta!!>
Mousse: The mountain vanished!!
<Ryouga:    RANMA wa...>
Ryouga: What about Ranma...

3
[Ranma comes out on the edge of the tornado, pointing the Gekkaja at
himself, with ice all over him.]

4
[Closeup of Saffron, looking angry.]

<Saffron:    daga soremo ICHIJIshinogi...>

<Saffron:    TSUGI wa KAKUJITSU ni sono KOOtta NIKUTAI no doMAnNAKA o UchiKUDAite kureyou zo...>
