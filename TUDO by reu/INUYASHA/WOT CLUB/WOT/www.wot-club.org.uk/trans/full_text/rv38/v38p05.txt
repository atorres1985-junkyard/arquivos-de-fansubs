Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 12 chapters long, costing 400 yen) when they become available
(typically 3-4 months after the weekly Shonen Sunday release), of
which all 38 volumes are on sale.


Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

(    Sorry about the really long delay between translations. I'll be translating
the rest of the remaining chapters as a high priority.)

[Saffron throws out an arm and light blazes from the end.]

<Saffron:    HOUOUSAN no OU no SADAME o...>
Saffron: About the fate of the kings of Mt Phoenix...

(    'punish' is somewhat weaker than the Japanese word used here, which is
rather ambiguous. "Kill you for your crimes" might would be a bit closer to
how it feels.)

Page 15
