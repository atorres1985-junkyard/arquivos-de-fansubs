Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 12 chapters long, costing 400 yen) when they become available
(typically 3-4 months after the weekly Shonen Sunday release), of
which all 38 volumes are on sale.


Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

[A torrent of flames smash Ranma down into the ground, with the Gekkaja nearby.]
Fx flames: roa-a-ar... <Go---...>

<Saffron:    YO no KINJAKAN no KOUNETSU de TAINAI no MIZU o USHINAishi MONO...>
Saffron: is someone who has lost all the water inside them due to the high temperature of One's Kinjakan...

Ranma: .oO(Her eyes will soon close completely!?).

3
[View of Saffron.]
<Saffron:    ONNA ni wa KI no DOKU da ga...>
Saffron: My condolences about the girl, but...
<Saffron:    YO ni mo JIKAN ga nai...>
Saffron: One has little time too...

4
[Ranma has stood up, somewhat shakily, looking at Saffron.]
Fx Ranma: *stagger...* <Yoro...>
<Ranma:    JIKAN...?>
Ranma: Time...?

5
[Ranma spies the Gekkaja, sticking into the ground point first behind him.]
<Ranma:    GEKKAJA...>

[Closeup of Saffron, with energy crackling around him.]

[As Ranma grabs the shaft of the Gekkaja, but it bends perpendicular to the

[Ranma is appaled.]
<Ranma:    ko_...>

[Back in the chamber with the Dragon and Phoenix Tap, which is now open to
the air, due to Saffron's blasts.]
Fx sound: rumble... <Gogogogogo...>
<narration:    IPPOU--- JUSENDOU NAI>
narration: Meanwhile, inside Jusendou

2
[All the guards are knocked out.]
Fx guards: thud-thud <dosa dosa dosa>

3
[Ryouga and Mousse stare in contempt at the guards, while in the background,
the Jusenkyou Guide and Plum are looking at the water main.]
<Ryouga:    fu_,>

<Ryouga:    taainonee!>

[The old man, Korma and Masala are on the side of the cavern.]

<Korma:    MITSUMEI!?>
Korma: Secret order!?
<old-man:    umu.>
old-man: Indeed.

2
[View of the Kinjakan stuck in the Phoenix Tap's head.]
<old-man:    yoika Koruma Masara,>
old-man: {off} Listen Korma, Masala,
<old-man:    omae-ra wa Safuran-sama ni KINJAKAN o oTODOkesuru no da.>
old-man: you must get the Kinjakan to Saffran-sama.

3
[Korma and Masala don't look too enthusiastic.]
<Korma:    ha? shikashi..>
Korma: Huh? But...
<Masala:    OUZOKU IGAI ga HANTSUETSUshita KINJAKAN o tsukamu to HIAgatte shimau no de wa...>
Masala: Gripping the burning Kinjakan for anyone lower than the Royal Family means being totally dried.

4
[The old man looks a bit worried at this.]
<old-man:    umu, soko de ja.>
old-man: Well, there is that.

5
[The old man moves Korma's and Masala's hands to play a game of Janken
(Paper-Scissors-Stone), though the boys look rather annoyed.]
<old-man:    Ja~n ken...>
old-man: Ja~an, ken...

(    When deciding something by Janken, you say "jan, ken," then "pon" and then
make your choice. Saying 'pon' again would indicate another round.)

6
[Masala and Korma kick the old man flying towards the Kinjakan.]
<Masala:    anta ga TOre!>
Masala: You get it!
<Korma:    TASHOU HIAgattemo kawaru mai.>
Korma: You're already rather dried up.
Fx old-man: (comical style) *kick* <den>
<old-man:    a"~~~~_.>
old-man: _Ah~h~h~h_!



Page 13

[Meanwhile Shampoo and Kiima are battling each other. Shampoo makes a flying
kick at Kiima, who has her back to the side of the cavern. Shampoo misses
and smashes some rocks.]
<Shampoo:    HA_.>
Shampoo: Destroy!
Fx rocks: wham <Doga_>

(    In manga, and Ranma 1/2, often when people make an attack they say 'ha',
but with the kanji for 'destroy' - it's the same 'ha' as in Hiryuu Shouten Ha.)

2
[Kiima does her wing attack.]
Fx air: *slice* <Zan>
<Kiima:    SUICHOU SENZAN YOKU >
Kiima: Suichou Senzan Yoku!! (Water-Bird 1000-slice Wing)

3
[The slices spread over the cavern, nearly hitting the old man (who is near
the Phoenix Tap), and one takes a slice off the head, including the Kinjakan.]
Fx Dragon Tap: thwack <Supa>

4
[Korma and Masala are impressed.]
<Korma:    oo_, yatta!>
Korma: Ohh, she did it!
<Masala:    sasuga TOSHIyori to TOSHIMA!!>
Masala: The old man and middle-aged woman certainly are great!!

5
[Kiima whacks Korma and Masala on the head.]
<Kiima:    DARE ga TOSHIMA desu.>
Kiima: Who're middle aged!
Fx Korma and Masala: clunk <mishi>



Page 14

[Back to where we left Saffron and Ranma a few pages back - Saffron firing
his fire ball (more like a stream of fire).]
<Saffron:    mohaya kore made!>
Saffron: Now it ends!
Fx flames: whoosh <Do_>
<Saffron:    SHInei, RANMA!>
Saffron: Die, Ranma!

2
[The other end of the fire-stream is almost upon Ranma, trying to pry out
the Gekkaja.]
Fx flames: roa-a-ar <Go--->
Fx Gekkaja: *unmoving* <Gishi_ Gi_>
<Ranma:    ku_>
Ranma: Ugh.

3
[Ranma dives behind a rock.]
Fx flames: (exploding) *flash* <Kaka_>

4
[Ranma looks on in surprise - the fire around the Gekkaja has gone.]
Fx air: *cool* <Juwa_ *guess>
Ranma: !?



Page 15
1
[View of the Gekkaja - a shallow crater has formed around it.]
Fx air: hshht <Shuu Shuu>
Fx :  <mou mou **??>

2
[Ranma realises something important.]
<Ranma:    are wa...>
Ranma: That's...
<Ranma:    SUIJOUKI!?>
Ranma: water vapour!?

3
[Ranma looks from behind the rock at the Gekkaja.]
Fx air: hshht... <Shu--...>
<Ranma:    dou iu koto da!?>
Ranma: .oO(What's this mean!?).
<Ranma:    asoko ni MIZUKE nanka nakatta hazu...>
Ranma: .oO(There shouldn't be any moisture over there...).

4
[Closeup of Ranma having a sudden realisation.]
<Ranma:    ha_,>
Ranma: .oO(Ah!).
<Ranma:    moshiya...>
Ranma: .oO(Maybe...).

5
[Ranam rushes forwards.]
<Ranma:    GEKKAJA no ano KATACHI...>
Ranma: .oO(the shape the Gekkaja's in...).
<Ranma:    KOWAreta n-ja nai to suru to...>
Ranma: .oO(is not because it broke...).
Fx Ranma: *dash* <Da_>

6
[Saffron is in the air above Ranma, preparing another strike.]
Fx Saffron: hshht <Shu--...>
<Saffron:    Baka-me, MUkatte kuru to wa...>
Saffron: You're a fool, to come over...



Page 16
1
[Ranma throws up something.]
<Ranma:    kore de mo kurae-_.>
Ranma: Take on this!
Fx Ranma: swish <Sha_>

2
[Saffron sees what appears to be Akane thrown up at him.]
Fx Akane: *spin about...* <Shururu...>
Saffron: !

3
[Closeup of Saffron.]
<Saffron:    kisama... INOCHI ga Oshikunatte ONNA o Tate ni...
**
>
Saffron: You arsehole... using the girl who gave her life to become a shield...
<Saffron:    ASAmashii yatsu!>
Saffron: Despicable creep!

4
[Closeup of 'Akane' - it's a stick with doll-Akane's clothes on. This is
called "Utushi-mi no Jutsu" - "Fake-body Art", and if often associated with
ninja's, though normally a log is used. Ranma has done this before -
against Herb, for example, though for himself.]
<Saffron:    ha_,>
Saffron: {off} Ah!

5
[Saffron blasts the twig in anger.]
<Saffron:    onore_, Nise-MONO ka_.>
Saffron: Damn you! A fake!
Fx flames: whoosh <Don>
Fx twin: *melt* <Ju_>

6
[Closeup of Ranma, with Akane in his shirt.]
<Ranma:    _tari me- daro.>
Ranma: .oO(You bet it is.).

7
[Ranma has taken the Gekkaja, but is facing down another fire-ball.]
Fx fire: roa-a-ar... <Go--...>
Fx Ranma: shh <Za_>



Page 17
1
[Ranma swings the Gekkaja into the ground in front of him - the prongs of
the Gekkaja stick into the ground.]
<Ranma:    de-i!>
Ranma: Hya!
Fx ground: whack <Ga_>

2
[Ranma pulls up the Gekkaja, which takes up a massive boulder, which is glittering.]
<Ranma:    nuoooo_!!>
Ranma: {straining} Hnyaaahhh!!
Fx boulder: thlock <gapo_ **>
Fx boulder: ding... <Ki-n...>

(    Not surprising that Ranma's straining - that boulder would weigh many tons
- one cubic meter of water would weigh 1 ton, and rock is denser, and that
boulder is several cubic meters big. He's also pulling it out of the
ground, at the end of a poll, and doing it fast.)

3
[The fire hits the boulder, which seems to start melting a little.]
Fx fire: roa-a-ar... <Go---...>
Fx boulder: sizzle... <Ju---..>

4
[Closeup of Ranma.]
<Ranma:    OMOtta toori!!>
Ranma: .oO(Just as I thought!!).
<Ranma:    GEKKAJA ni wa IWA o mo SHUNKAN REIKYAKUsuru IRYOKU ga aru!!>
Ranma: .oO(The Gekkaja has the power to even cool rock in an instant!!).
<Ranma:    MIZU no nai TOKORO ni SUIJOUKI ga HASSEIshita no mo sono tame!!>
Ranma: .oO(That's why water vapour came out from a place which has no water!!).



Page 18
1
[Ranma starts hacking up the ground, creating lots of ice-covered rocks, so
fast you see three of him at once.]
<Ranma:    ...to nareba...>
Ranma: .oO(...In which case...).
Fx ground:  <gashu gashu gashu gashu **>

2
[Saffron fires down another blast from above.]
<Saffron:    Baka-me, sonna TOKORO o TAGAYAshite dou naru!!>
Saffron: Dman fool, what will ploughing the ground achieve!!
Fx blast: ka-boom <Bon>

3
[View of Ranma from Saffron's point of view - Ranma has carved up a spiral
of ice, and is standing in the centre.]
Fx air: whoosh... <Go---...>

4
[Closeup of Ranma.]
<Ranma:    fu_,>
Ranma: Heh,
<Ranma:    KUBI ARAtte MAtte-ro, Safuran.>
Ranma: get ready for a real close shave, Saffron.

(    Actually, Ranma literally says "wash your neck", which is a rather
colourful way of saying "prepare to die".)



Page 19
1
[Diagram of the ice spiral, and Saffron's fire-blast approaching, with
arrows spiraling up from the ice.]
<Ranma:    KOORI no RANSEN ni HI no TAMA o Uchikomaseru koto de,>
Ranma: .oO(When the ball of fire smashes into the ice spiral,).
<Ranma:    TAIRYOU no SUIJOUKI to, KYOKUTAN na ONDOSA ni yoru JOUSHOUKIRYUU ga HASSEIsuru!!>
Ranma: .oO(the large amount of steam will cause a extreme temperature difference, and a rising air current will occur.).

2
[Ranma makes an upward punch at nothing, but the ground explodes up around him.]
<Ranma:    kore de IKKI ni Kata o tsukete yaru!!>
Ranma: .oO(I will finish things off at once!!).
Fx blast: *cool* <Juwa_ *hmmm>

3
[Closeup of Ranma.]
<Ranma:    kurae_, HIRYUU SHOUTEN HA!!>
Ranma: Eat this! Hiyuu Shouten Ha!! (Dragon flying to Heaven Death Blow)
Fx blast: wham <Don>



Page 20
1
[Saffron finds himself caught up in a rush of air.]
Fx air: whoosh <Go_>
Saffron: !!

2
[View of the large tornado.]
Fx air: who-o-o-o-sh <Go---->

3
[Inside the cavern, Ryouga and Mousse look out, while the Guide looks at the
pipe. They've been trying to break it, but nothing has worked - there are
fist-marks, foot-marks, cuts and Ryouga's also tried to Bakusai Tenketsu
it, all to no effect.]
<guide:    Biku-tomo shinai na.>
guide: It hasn't even cracked.
<Ryouga:    n!?>
Ryouga: Hn!?
<Mousse:    TATSUMAKI...>
Mousse: A tornado...

[Inside Saffron is going for a little spin.]

Saffron: Heh, whatever kind of exaggerated move you think this is...

3
[Closeup of Saffron.]
<Saffron:    OROka na!>
Saffron: you are a fool!
<Saffron:    TSUBASA o MOtsu YO ni wa TATSUMAKI nado nan no DAGEKI mo...>
Saffron: Since One has wings, a mere tornado does not damage [at all]...

4
[Saffron turns his head to see Ranma almost upon him, attacking from behind
with the Gekkaja.]
Fx wind: who-o-o-sh... <Go---...>
<Ranma:    darou na!!>
Ranma: You wish!!



Page 22
1
[Ranma swings the Gekkaja at Saffron, who throws up his arm, and the Gekkaja
sticks into it.]
<Ranma:    kurae-, GEKKAJA!!>
Ranma: Eat this! The Gekkaja!
Fx Saffron: whack <Ga_>

2
[Saffron's arm and the left side of his face freezes, or is covered by ice
at least.]
Fx ice: crink-crink <Piki Piki Piki>

3
[Closeup of Ranma.]
Fx Ranma: *force down Gekkaja* <Giri Giri>
<Ranma:    fu_,>
Ranma: Heh,
<Ranma:    TATSUMAKI nanzo de buttobasene- to wa SENKOKU SHOUCHI!>
Ranma: I'm well aware that a mere toronado wouldn't blow you away!

4
[View of Ranma and Saffron, swinning around in the tornado, with the left
side of Saffron's body turning into ice.]
<Ranma:    teme- no CHIKAku ni TObu no ga MOKUTEKI datta n-dei_!>
Ranma: My plan was just to get in close to you!

Ranma: .oO(Don't close your eyes, Akane.).
<Ranma:    ato SUKOshi da.>
Ranma: .oO(It's not long now.).

2
[Ranma turns to see the spinning hoop of the Kinjakan coming at him.]
Fx hoop: whizz <Gyuin>
Ranma: !

3
[Ranma moves out the way, and the hoop smashes through Saffron's frozen arm.]
<Ranma:    uwa_.>
Ranma: Uwha!
Fx hoop: ka-rash <Gasha-n>

4
[Ranma is seperated from Saffron, with a frozen arm still attached to the Gekkaja.]
Fx air: who-o-o-sh <Go--->
<Ranma:    shimatta...>
Ranma: Dammit...

5
[Saffron looks up to see the Kinjakan, the hoop, and Korma and Masala, who
are both unconscious.]
