Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 12 chapters long, costing 400 yen) when they become available
(typically 3-4 months after the weekly Shonen Sunday release), of
which all 38 volumes are on sale.


Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

to him, and looking at doll-Akane in his hands.]
<Ranma:    akane-_!!>
Ranma: Akane-e!!

[Ranma grabs the Gekkaja.]
Fx Ranma: (Gekkaja) *snatch* <Ba_>
<Ranma:    ku_,>
Ranma: Ugh!
<Ranma:    kono mama Ochi-ru no o MAtte-ta n-ja MAniAwanee_!>

[Ranma throws the Gekkaja down.]
<Ranma:    Ike-_ GEKKAJA!!>
Ranma: Go, Gekkaja!!

2
[From way up in the air, Ranma has thrown the Gekkaja right into it's slot
on the Dragon Tap's head.]
Fx Gekkaja: vfwip <Byu_>
Fx Gekkaja: (Dragon Tap) *stick in* <Dosu>
Fx Gekkaja: sha-kin <Jaki-n>

3
[The Guide looks off at this, and Ryouga starts moving forwards.]
<guide:    oKYAKU-san, GEKKAJA hineru yoroshi!!>
guide: Okyaku-san, please turn on the Gekkaja!!
<Ryouga:    ou_.>

[Ranma's fist starts glowing.]
<Ranma:    HISSHOU no ICHIGEKI!!>
Ranma: A strike for life!!

(    Ranma says 'hisshou no ichigeki', literally "a single strike of certain
life". This has effectively been made up by Ranma, and is in contrast to
phrases like 'hisshou no ichigeki' (with different kanji for hisshou),
meaning "a strike of certain victory", and 'hissatsu no ichigeki', "a
strike of certain death".)

3
[Ranma makes a punch, from which comes a large blast of power, and behind
him is a drawing of a dragon looking up at the sky.]

[On a ledge by the Dragon Tap sits Ranma, with Akane in his arms - he's male
again, due to a kettle next to him. Water from the Dragon Tap has filled up
most of the cavern and is pouring out of a hole blown in the side from the
earlier battle.]
Fx water: shh-shh... <Zazaza...>

Ranma: .oO(I wanted to tell you I love you!).
<Ranma:    akane---_!!>
Ranma: Akane-e-e-e!!

(    It's seems pretty clear from the way it was drawn, that Ranma's "I wanted
to tell you I love you" line was _not_ spoken. More on this later.)

[Wide angle above shot of Jusenkyou - all the pools are flooded, and if not
for the bamboo poles, you wouldn't be able to tell which was which. Ranma
is standing near the edge of the water, Akane a bit behind him. A bit to
the side, the Guide is explaining to Ryouga (holding up an umbrella) and
the rest just gaze out at the pools.]

Fx Shampoo-cat: *me~ew* <ni"~~>
<panda-sign:    mazeru KIKEN>
panda-sign: Danger - Do Not Mix

(    Akane's comment is a bit tricky to translate. As a totally stolen
alternative, maybe "What must be endured, can be". What the panda-sign may
be seen on jars of chemicals, for example.)

2
[Sometime later, Shampoo points to Genma-panda.]
<Ranma:    nao Shanpuu no TESHITA deatta oyaji wa KAIHOUsareta.>

[Soun and Genma explain things to Ranma, while Nodoka looks on, wiping off
happy tears with a hanky.]
<Soun:    iya,>
Soun: Well,
<Soun:    akane ga SHUUGEN agete mo ii tte...>
Soun: Akane said it's okay to ahead with the wedding...
<Ranma:    e".>

[Ranma finds himself looking at Akane in a white, Western style wedding
dress, with a nice flower motif. (I'm not an Akane fan, but I think, and
still think after 3 years, that this is the loveliest drawings of any of
the female characters in the entire series)]
<Akane:    RANMA...>
Akane: Ranma...

<Ranma:    kawaii to...>

Fx Ranma: (heart) thud-thud-thud-thud <do_ do_ do_ do_ do_>

(    Reminder that at the beginning of the final story-arc (volume 37, part 1),
the parents dressed up Akane in a Japanese style wedding dress, while she
was unconscious.)

3
[Akane blushes, holding a hand up to her face, demurely.]
<Akane:    HONTOU...?>
Akane: Really...?

[Back in Akane's room, Ranma and Akane are sitting on the floor in front of
each other, both looking down at the floor.]

<Ranma:    Itte nee_.>
Ranma: I didn't say it!
<Akane:    Itta mo DOUZEN yo_.>
Akane: You almost said it!

(    Ranma didn't actually say "I wanted to tell you I love you", but thought
it, but perhaps Akane felt it as it were - there is this concept called
'ishin denshin' which an empathy or silent understanding - a heart to
heart. There are some other connotations with this concept as well, as it
is often associated with couples who have been married for some time, or
are very close...)

[Ranma moves back a bit, taking a defensive stance.]
<Ranma:    nanda to, yaru ka_.>

a formal kimono too.]

[Shampoo, in a Chinese dress, and Ukyou, in a kimono, are there with a bunch

Page 31

[View of inside the Dojo. This is quite complex, so I'll split it up. First,
at the top, the students tentatively enter where Nabiki holds out a hand.]
<student:    koko ja...>
student: This...
<student:    nai rashi- na.>
student: doesn't seem like the right place.
Fx Nabiki: *hold out hand* <te_*guess>
<Nabiki:    KANE.>
Nabiki: The money.
[Nabiki is asking for the traditional gift on money from the guests. This is
then used later for sending thank-you gifts. Next: On the right is Hinako,
going hyper near the cake, in the center Akane in casually kicking Kuno in
the face (while in her wedding dress), with Happosai clinging to the dress.
At the bottom right, Kodachi is looking around.]
<Hinako:    wa-i Ke-ki da.>
Hinako: Yay, the cake!
<Kuno:    TENDOU akane boku to KYOSHIKI o__.>
Kuno: Tendo Akane, have a wedding ceremony with me-e-e!

<Kodachi:    RANMA-sama wa izuko__.>
Kodachi: Where is Ranma-sama!?
[In the bottom left are Kasumi, looking on with a smile, Soun, looking
haunted, Nodoka looking slightly surprised and Genma-panda rolling about
with a tear in his eye.]
<Kasumi:    maa nigiyaka.>
Kasumi: My, what a bustle.
Fx Soun: *stare blankly* <hiu~~~ **??>
Fx Genma-panda: *roll about* <go-ro go-ro>
[In the middle left, Ryouga is sitting by himself looking gloomy, Ukyou and
Shampoo are holding Ranma (still female, and unconscious), Konatsu is
hiding behind a speech bubble, and Mousse is going for Cologne again.]
Fx remains of Nanniichuan barrel sign: *flutter* <hira...>
<Ryouga:    fu_...>

[Sometime later, a closeup of Soun.]
<Soun:    ...ma,>
Soun: ...Well,
<Soun:    so-yu wake nande,>
Soun: for that reason,

3
[Soun is sitting at the table, smoking, with Akane and Ranma on the other
side looking at each other accusingly. To the side, Genma-panda is playing
with a beach-ball, and outside Kasumi is hanging up the washing.]
<Soun:    SHUUGEN wa moSUKOshi SHINBEN SEIRIshite kara to yu- koto de...>
Soun: the wedding ceremony will be held off a bit longer, until your personal affairs can be sorted out...
Fx Soun: (smoke) puff <ha~>
<Akane:    daitai anta ga ne-.>
Akane: That mostly applies to you.
<Ranma:    ome- no sei da.>
Ranma: It was your fault.
<narration:    so-yu- wake de koko kara SAKI wa--->
narration: And so, for a little while longer...

(    In Japan, before you get married, you're supposed to sort out, tidy up,
finish, etc, any 'hanging' relationships.)



Page 32

[Closeup of Akane and Ranma. Akane is looking at Ranma out of the corner of
her eye, smiling slightly. Ranma is looking at Akane slightly askance.]
<narration:    ENCHOUSEN--->
narration: [the wedding] is in "extra time"...

(    The narration uses a sporting analogy here - basically it's saying that
normally the 'game' would have ended by now, but has instead gone into an
'extra innings'. In an interview after the series ended, Takahashi-sensei
said she decided to go for a less conclusive ending so that the fans could
imagine what comes next.)

2
[View from behind as Ranma and Akane run off to school together. (Ranma
isn't walking on the fence)]
<Akane:    Itteki ma-su.>
Akane: We're off!

(    At the bottom is a list of people who contributed to the series (eg
Takahashi-sensei's assistants), which I'll romanise when I get around to
checking my translations. Right at the bottom it says "Ranma 1/2 - The End".)
