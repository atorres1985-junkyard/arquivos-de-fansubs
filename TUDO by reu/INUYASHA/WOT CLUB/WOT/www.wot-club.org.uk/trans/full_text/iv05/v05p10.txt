Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

[Inuyasha, Kaede and Shippou are standing a few meters back from the huge
warding surrounding the casket that Kagome's in. A little bit to the side

[Bright light shines out from Kagome's head, and her hair is being whipped
about, and dark surface of the warding is tearing apart.]

[View of Urasue and Inuyasha looking on.]
<Urasue:    oo_, KEKKAI ga YABUreta!?>

[Urasue turns to Inuyasha, looking faintly pleased.]
<Urasue:    KOMUSUME no TAMASHII yo.>

<Urasue:    KEKKAI o HAtte made DEru no o KOBAnde otta ga na.>

[Closeup of Urasue making a point.]
<Urasue:    sore ga, onushi ni NA o YObareta totan ni,>

<Urasue:    KOKORO MIDArete hajike TObu to wa...>

[View of Inuyasha and Kaede looking worried.]
<Urasue:    washi ni totte wa KOUTSUGOU daga na.>

is sitting on the ground, still with a vacant expression.]

[Closeup of Urasue turning to the side.]
<Urasue:    uhihihi,>
Urasue: Uhihihi!
<Urasue:    sono MUSUME wa mohaya TAMASHI no nai NUkeGARA yo.>
Urasue: Without a soul that girl is now just a cast off shell.
<Urasue:    ato de MISOzuke ni shite KUrou te yaru wa.>
Urasue: Afterwards I'll preserve her in Miso to eat later.

(    'Miso' often refers to 'miso soup', but in this case it means as a pickling mixture.)
