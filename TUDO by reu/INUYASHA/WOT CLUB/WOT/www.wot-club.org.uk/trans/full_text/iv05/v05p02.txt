Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

Myouga: For Inuyasha-sama and other Half-Youkai,
<Myouga:    TAINAI ni NAGAreru YOUKAI no CHI no REIRYOKU o, ITTOKI      USHINAu toki ga aru.
            in bod    flow                                  short time  loose

[Kagome turns to look at Myouga on her shoulder.]
<Myouga:    sore wa INOCHI ni KAKAwaru koto yue,
                    life      to do with
>
Myouga: Because that is a matter of life [and death],
<Myouga:    HANYOU wa KESshite sono JIKI o HOKA no MONO ni Akasanu.>
Myouga: Half-Youkai never reveal that period to other people.

[Myouga looks up into the dark sky.]
<Myouga:    INUYASHA-SAMA no sono TOKI ga KOYOI... >
Myouga: [It's surprising] that the time, for Inuyasha-sama, is tonight...

Myouga: why couldn't you have at least told me.
<Inuyasha:    ome- SHIttetara IMAGORO NIgeteru daro.>
Inuyasha: You'd be running away about now if you knew, of course.

(    When Myouga says Inuyasha should be able to trust him, he says it in a way
that implies that he, Myouga, is particularly trustworthly, and he's
basically inflating his own importance.)

5
[Inuyasha looks at Myouga, who looks down in anger.]
Myouga: ......

6
[Myouga angrily bounces along, yelling at Inuyasha, who yells back angrily.]
<Myouga:    sonna ni washi ga SHINYOU dekinu ka_.>
Myouga: Can't you trust me that far!?
<Inuyasha:    sono MA ga SHINYOU dekine- tsutte n-da_.>
Inuyasha: That pause explains why I can't trust ya!

(    Inuyasha means that if Myouga really hadn't already thought about running
away, he wouldn't have had that pause in frame 5, when he should have been
denying that he'd run away.)

7
[Inuyasha edges away as Kagome comes up to speak to him.]

in shock and surprise. A bit to the side, Shippou thinks to himself.]

Kagome: we've ended up in the worst possible state, haven't we!
<Kagome:    Baka yo anata,>

<Inuyasha:    na_...>
