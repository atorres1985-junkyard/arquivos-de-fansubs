Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

down the street with a bow, and has bandages covering wounds on her
forehead and arm.]
<villager:    KAEDE-sama!>

<Kaede:    washi no CHIKARA dewa FUSEgi kirenakatta...>
Kaede: I wasn't able to protect it with my power...

5
[Kagome and Kaede are standing on front of a large, round crater, which has
several slice marks in it - presumably from the scythe.]
<Kagome:    a...?>
Kagome: Ah...?
<Kagome:    kore...?>
Kagome: This is...?



Page 9

[View of a small, damaged, wooden shrine.]

2
[Closeup of Kagome, looking concerned.]
<Kagome:    HOKORA da wa...>
Kagome: .oO(It's a small shrine...).
<Kagome:    ABOkareteru...?>
Kagome: .oO(It's been violated...?).

<Kaede:    kore wa...>

[Flashback to chapter 1, when Kikyou was burnt in the flames, holding the
Shikon no Tama jewel between her fingers.]

Urasue: I'm taking Kikyou's holy bones.

(    Urasue thinks that Kikyou's bones have special magical or spiritual properties.)

over most of the page, Kagome stands with a surprised expression.]

[View of Kikyou with her bow with some vegetation in the background.]

Kaede: ......

2
[Closeup of Kaede thinking to herself.]
<Kaede:    sou ka...>
Kaede: Well...
<Kaede:    sou datta na...>
Kaede: That's the way it was, wasn't it...

3
[Inuyasha is sitting just in front of a tree, and large dragonflies are
flying past in the background.]
<Inuyasha:    MYOUGA-jijii, iru n-daro?>
Inuyasha: Myouga-jijii, you're there aren't you?
<Inuyasha:    Tsura DAshi na.>
Inuyasha: Come out would ya.

[Closeup of Inuyasha turning to look at Myouga, who comes out of Inuyasha hair.]
Fx Myouga: *appear* <hyoi>
<Myouga:    haa~>
Myouga: _Hm~m_
<Myouga:    amari KAKAwari tou nai...

Inuyasha: wasn't just [the smell of] bones...

7
[View of the small crater cut out of the ground.]

while Inuyasha looks away, annoyed.]
<Kagome:    nee,>

<Kagome:    kawai sou ja nai oKOTSU TOrareru nante.>
Kagome: don't you think it so sad that the bones got taken.

6
[Closeup of Kagome looking a little serious and sad.]
<Kagome:    soreni, donna ni NIKUkutemo...>
Kagome: Besides, however much you hated her...
<Kagome:    KIKYOU wa zutto MUKASHI ni SHInjatta n-desho?>
Kagome: Kikyou's been dead for a long time, hasn't she?

7
[Closeup of Inuyasha reacting to something.]



Page 14

[Kagome continues to talk to Inuyasha who is still looking away.]
<Kagome:    anta to KIKYOU no AIDA ni nani ga atta to shitemo,
                                              subjunctive mood
>
Kagome: Whatever happened between you and Kikyou,
<Kagome:    IMA wa mou...>
Kagome: it's [old history] already...

2
[Kagome looks at Inuyasha who is looking away from Kagome, and seems to be
ignoring her.]
Kagome: ......

3
[Kagome angrily yanks on Inuyasha's hair, pulling him towards her.]
Fx Kagome: (comically) *yank* <Gui_>
<Kagome:    chotto_.>
Kagome: Hey!

4
[Kagome speaks to Inuyasha, who looks angry.]
<Inuyasha:    na...>
Inuyasha: Wha...
<Kagome:    anta, kinou kara atashi no KAO MIyou to shinai wa yo ne_.>
Kagome: You've been avoiding looking at my face since yesterday, haven't you.

5
[Kagome continues to press Inuyasha, and is getting quite close to him.]
<Kagome:    atashi no KAO ga KIKYOU ni NIteru kara iyana no!?>
Kagome: Because my face looks like Kikyou's, it's terrible!?
<Kagome:    KIRAi na no!?>
Kagome: You hate me!?

6
[Closeup of Inuyasha suddenly grabbing Kagome's hand.]
Fx Inuyasha: *grip* <Gu_>
Kagome: !



Page 15
1
[Inuyasha has pulled Kagome very close, and their faces are just a few
inches apart. Inuyasha looks serious and sad, and Kagome looks surprised.]
<Inuyasha:    sonna ja...>
Inuyasha: It [wasn't]...
<Kagome:    E...!?>
Kagome: .oO(Eh...!?).
Fx Kagome: (heart) thump... <Doki...>

2
[View of Kagome's face, with Inuyasha just in front, and Kagome looks
somewhat startled, and is blushing a little.]
<Kagome:    e..>
Kagome: .oO(Eh...).
<Kagome:    na...>
Kagome: .oO(Wha...).
<Kagome:    nani...?>
Kagome: .oO(What...?).

<Kagome:    nani yo_!>
Kagome: what're you doing!?

[Kagome is sitting with her back to Inuyasha, who is partly seen lying on
the floor off-frame. Kagome has turned around, and looks nervous and is blushing.]

<Kagome:    na, na, nanna no IMA no wa.>
Kagome: .oO(Wha, wha, what was going on just now.).
Fx Kagome: (heart) *thump thump thump* <Doki Doki Doki>

(    I remember Rumiko Takahashi once saying that she finds it embarrasing to do
scenes like when Ryouga's trying to tell Akane he loves her, and often
makes it a gag scene as a result. The natural interpretation of what
Inuyasha was trying to saw would be "It's not that sort of thing" - ie he
and Kikyou weren't really enemies.)



Page 16
1
[By the village, Kaede is sitting on top of a horse, with a bow on her back,
and is talking to a man standing next to her.]

<Kaede:    washi to te IMOUTO MIKO...>
Kaede: .oO(As the priestess [succeeding] Kikyou-onee-sama...).
<Kaede:    KIKYOU-onee-sama no HONE wa waga TE de...>
Kaede: .oO(I shall [recover] my sister's bones by own efforts...).

4
[Kaede turns to see Kagome catching up to her on her bike, and with Shippou
jumping onto the back.]
Fx bike: (bell) *jingle* <chiririn>
<Kagome:    washi ISSHOU ni Iku.>
Kagome: I'm coming with you.
<Shippou:    ora mo.>
Shippou: Me too.
<Kaede:    kagome.>
Kaede: Kagome.

[Closeup of Kagome, looking to the side, and blushing slightly.]

<Inuyasha:    hoka ni nani ga aru tte n-da yo_.>
Inuyasha: You saying there could be something else [between Kikyou and I]?
<Kaede:    INUYASHA...>
Kaede: Inuyasha...

2
[Kaede looks back at Inuyasha, who looks away.]
<Kaede:    onushi mo KUru no ka?>
Kaede: You coming too?
<Kaede:    doushita KAZE no FUkimawashi dai.>
Kaede: This is a strange turn of events.
<Inuyasha:    ke_.>
Inuyasha: Bah.

3
[Closeup of Kagome.]
<Kagome:    INUYASHA nanika KAKUshiteru.>
Kagome: .oO(Inuyasha's hiding something.).
<Kagome:    datte sakki atashi o MIta ME wa...>
Kagome: .oO(Because his expression when he looked at me was...).

(    Kagome's probably going to say that Inuyasha's expression indicated mixed
feelings, or at least, something beyond simple hatred, for Kikyou.)

4
[View of some rocky hills, mostly covered with trees.]
Fx wind: who-o-o-sh... <Hyu-----...>
