Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

Nazuna: and in return for that...
<Nazuna:    KATAKI o totte!!>
Nazuna: take revenge!!

(    Nazuna is telling Inuyasha to run away, leaving her, so that he can take
out the priest - she thinks that he won't be able to rescue her and live,
so she's basically telling him that getting revenge is more important (to
her) than her life.)

[Kagome, Inuyasha and Shippou are sitting in the boat, which is by the
riverbank, looking at Nazuna who's standing near.]

[Closeup of Nazuna, blushing a little.]
<Nazuna:    arigato INUYASHA,>
Nazuna: Thankyou Inuyasha.
<Nazuna:    anta ii YOUKAI datta n-da ne.>
Nazuna: You're a nice Youkai, aren't you.

(    Nazuna's line also has the nuance of "you turned out to be a nice Youkai".)

2
[Kagome, looking a little surprised, turns to look at Inuyasha out of the
corner of her eye, while Inuyasha looks off at Nazuna from the side.]
Inuyasha: ...
<Inuyasha:    ke_.>
Inuyasha: Bah.

3
[View of some trees, while the party is sailing down the river.]
Fx water: shlish... <Za...>

4
[Kagome addresses Inuyasha who is sitting at the front looking ahead.]
Fx water: shlish shlish <Zaza...>
<Kagome:    ne-, KARADA mou ZENZEN HEIKI na no?>
Kagome: Say, is your body already completely fine?
<Inuyasha:    _tarime- daro.>
Inuyasha: Course it has.

5
[Inuyasha turns to look back while Myouga bounces along his shoulder.]

[Closeup of Myouga.]
<Myouga:    SHINGETSU no YORU, INUYASHA-sama ga YOURYOKU o USHINAu to iu koto.>
Myouga: About Inuyasha-sama loosing his powers on the night of the full moon.
<Myouga:    kore ga SHIKON no kakera o NERAu YOUKAI-domo ni SHIretara, INOCHI ni kakawaru.>
Myouga: If the Youkai who are after the Shikon fragments find out, it could make the difference between life and death.

7
[Everyone turns to glare at Myouga.]
<Myouga:    onushi mo TAGONsuru na yo SHIPPOU,>
Myouga: You and Shippou, don't tell others,
<Myouga:    INUYASHA-sama no YOWAMI.>
Myouga: Inuyasha-sama's fatal weak point.
<Shippou:    YOWAMI ja na.>
Shippou: It's his _weak point_, isn't it!
<Inuyasha:    HIMITSU to Ie HIMITSU to.>
Inuyasha: It's just a secret, so call it a secret!
<Kagome:    HONTOU ni MOTO ni MODOtteru.>
Kagome: .oO(He really has returned to normal...).

(    The Japanese for 'weak point' here is 'yowami', which sounds very
malicious, and if it's about to be used for blackmail - and Shippou is
actually taunting Inuyasha. This is why Inuyasha wants it to be referred as
a 'secret'.)

[Kagome, with her head resting on her chin, stares out into space against a

3
[Closeup of Kagome staring.]
Fx Kagome: *stare...* <ji--...>
<Kagome:    HONKI datta no ka na...>
Kagome: .oO(I wonder if he was serious...).

4
[Closeup of Inuyasha looking back at Kagome.]
<Kagome:    KIkitai kedo...>
Kagome: .oO(I want to know, but...).

5
[Inuyasha turns to look back at Kagome, whose eyes have narrowed, while at
the back of the boat, Shippou is leaning out, looking sick.]
Fx Shippou: *sea sick...* <u"e"-->
<Inuyasha:    nandei HITO no KAO Jirojiro MI yagatte,>
Inuyasha: Why are you fucking staring at person's face for,
<Inuyasha:    nanka MONKU an no ka Kora.>
Inuyasha: do you have a complaint or something, huh!?
<Kagome:    yappa ii ya do- demo.>
Kagome: .oO(But on second thought, it doesn't matter.).

(    Kagome did seriously want to know what Inuyasha had thought of her, but his
attitude just then made her change her mind.)
