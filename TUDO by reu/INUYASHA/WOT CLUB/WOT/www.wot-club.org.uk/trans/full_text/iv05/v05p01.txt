Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

<Nazuna:    OSHOU-sama?>
Nazuna: Oshou-sama?

(    'Oshou' is a title of address for a Buddhist priest. Oshou-sama could
indicate that the person is a high level priest, or that Nazuna has a lot
of respect for the priest.)

<priest:    YOUKAI ga OSOroshuute tamaran no jarou.
                      = osoroshikute
>
priest: It seems that she can't help dreading the Youkai.

6
[View of part of the temple.]
<priest:    kono TERA wa washi no tsutanai HOURIKI de KEKKAI o hatte oru yue,
                                  clumsy   clerical powers               = kara/node
>
priest: I have erected a warding around this temple with my humble clerical powers,
<priest:    KUMOGASHIRA-domo wa haitte KOrenu...>
priest: and so the Spider Heads can't come in...

and Kagome is a bit surprised.]

priest: are an _ordinary human_, are you not?
Kagome: !?
<Inuyasha:    na_...>
Inuyasha: Wha...

2
[Inuyasha turns to look at the priest, looking a little angry.]
<Inuyasha:    ore ga tada no NINGEN daa?>
Inuyasha: I'm a ordinary human!?
<Inuyasha:    BOUZU temee doko ni MEe tsukete...
the 'e' of MEe is katakana - extra rudeness.
>
Inuyasha: You bloody priest, what do you think you're looking at...

3
[Closeup of the priest.]
<priest:    ME ni UTSUru SUGATA wa tomokaku...>
priest: Your visible appearance is one thing... but,
<priest:    onushi kara ma'tta'ku' YOUKI ga KANjirarenu no de na.>
priest: I can't sense the feeling of a Youkai from you _at all_, you see.

the rest being covered by threads.]
Fx Kagome: (pulling on Inuyasha) *drag* <Zuru_>
<Kagome:    INUYASHA shikkari.>
Kagome: Hang in there Inuyasha.

[View of someone, probably Kagome, running through the night forest.]
Fx footsteps: shh shh <Zazaza>
<Kagome:    haa haa.>
Kagome: {off} Huaah huaah.
<Kagome:    haa.>
Kagome: Huaah.
<Kagome:    haa.>
Kagome: Huaah

[Kagome, Shippou and Inuyasha (who is still covered by threads and is
sitting down) have stopped by a tree looking behind them.]
Fx Inuyasha: (trail of threads) swish <Zan...>
<Kagome:    ... mou Otte konai mitai...>
Kagome: ... Looks like they aren't following any more...

3
[Kagome turns to Inuyasha, who is sitting down with his head covered in
threads, and is holding onto Tetsusaiga.]
Kagome: ......
<Inuyasha:    chikushou...>
Inuyasha: Dammit...

4
[Kagome comes up to Inuyasha looking worried, and he responds angrily.]
<Kagome:    INUYASHA...>
Kagome: Inuyasha...
<Kagome:    dou shichatta no yo.>
Kagome: What's happened to you?
<Inuyasha:    urusee!>
Inuyasha: Shuddup!

5
[Inuyasha puts his back to the tree, and puts his hand to the threads around
his hair, while Shippou jumps up and bonks Inuyasha.]
Fx Shippou: whack <pen>
<Shippou:    nan ja kono TAIDO wa.>
Shippou: What's with that attitude!?
<Shippou:    kagome ga SHINPAI shite yatteru no ni.>
Shippou: Kagome's worried about you.
<Inuyasha:    ore no koto yori...>
Inuyasha: Besides myself...

6
[Inuyasha starts pulling at the threads around his head.]
Fx threads: shh <Za_>
<Inuyasha:    temeera JIBUN no SHINPAI shitero yo.>
Inuyasha: you bastards should worry about yourselves.

7
[Kagome stares in shock at something.]
<Kagome:    a...!?>
Kagome: Ah...!?

[Inuyasha pulls the threads off his hair to reveal black hair (though it's
shaped the same as his normal blue hair), and his dog-ears have gone,
though his eyes are still cat-like slits.]
Fx Inuyasha: rustle... <Zawa...>
<Inuyasha:    itsumo mitee ni MAMOte moraeru to OMOttara OOMACHIGAi da ze.>
Inuyasha: If you're expecting to be saved like usual, you're badly mistaken.

2
[Kagome, Myouga (on Kagome's shoulder) and Shippou look on in shock.]
<Shippou:    na''_...>
Shippou: _Wha_...
<Kagome:    INUYASHA... na no!?>
Kagome: Inuyasha... or...!?
