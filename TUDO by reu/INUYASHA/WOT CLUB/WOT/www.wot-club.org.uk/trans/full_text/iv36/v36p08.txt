Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

<Shippou:    INUYASHA mo mada mada to iu koto ja na.>
Shippou: Inuyasha still has a long long way to go.

(    Bit hard to translate this well. Shippou is basically criticising Inuyasha,
and saying he's got a lot to improve on.)
