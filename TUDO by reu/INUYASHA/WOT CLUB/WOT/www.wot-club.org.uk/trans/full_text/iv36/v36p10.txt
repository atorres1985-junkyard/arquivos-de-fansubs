Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

<Title:    GENJUTSU>
Title: Illusion

(    A more accurate translation of the title would be "illusionary spell",
though "spell" doesn't have quite the same meaning. Illusion isn't quite
right either - more like something that effects the subject mentally in general.)

<Kagome:    ii OTOKO ni yoromeita n-ja nai n-da-.>
Kagome: Aw, so you weren't having an affair with the pretty guy.
<Sango:    tsumaranasou da na.>

[Miroku turns around and claps Sango's hands, looking ernest. The background
has gone all dreamy.]

5
[Inuyasha and Kagome seem a bit surprised.]
<Inuyasha:    n...?>
Inuyasha: Hm...?
<Kagome:    DOKEKEshi tte...>
Kagome: By "antitoxin"...

6
[The group is now walking along. Sango is scratching her hand though.]
<Kagome:    moshikasuru to kayumiDOme..?>
Kagome: I guess he meant anti-itch...?
<Inuyasha:    na-ni ga BANNOU no DOKUKEshi dei.>
Inuyasha: Humph, just how is that an all-purpose anti-toxin.
<Shippou:    shikamo KIitoran.>
Shippou: It doesn't even work.
<Miroku:    Nise-GUSURI de onago o taburakasu to wa, hidoi yatsu deshita na.>
Miroku: What a terrible guy, to trick girls with a fake medicine.
<Sango:    so-yu- yatsu ni NArete-ru kara...>
Sango: Well, I'm used to those types...
Fx Sango: scratch scratch <pori pori pori>

(    The japanese word here for "antitoxin" can mean antidote as well. A bit of
word games.)
