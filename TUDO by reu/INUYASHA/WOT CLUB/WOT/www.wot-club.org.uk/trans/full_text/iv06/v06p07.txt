Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

written) Pocket Monster game/anime/toys perhaps? An Oni is a traditional
Japanese monster.)

<Kagome:    na-nte ne.>

[Kagome turns to glare at Inuyasha with some embarrassment, while Inuyasha
is stumbling away wide-eyed, clutching his hands.]

[View of the sky.]

3
[Several people are walking along a wide rode near a Shinto Shrine, and
quite a few traders are sitting on the ground, on mats, with their wares.]

4
[Closeup of Miroku yawning.]
<Miroku:    fuwa~~>
Miroku: *ya~a~wn*
<Miroku:    kakera no TE ga kari mo nee shi...>
Miroku: There's no clue to the fragments...
<Miroku:    doushita mon ka ne.>
Miroku: What do I do now.

5
[Miroku looks up at a voice off-scene.]
Fx sound: *whump* <Doka_>
<voice:    kono GEROU_!>
voice: You lowlife!

[Two attendants in the same uniform are kicking a man who's lying on the
ground, clutching some paper. Up ahead is what looks to be some lady, and
her two maids, one of which is holding an umbrella over the lady's head.]
Fx attendants: *whump whump* <Doka Doka>
<attendant-1:    HIME-sama o NUSUmi MIotte.>
attendant-1: You were peeking at the princess.
<attendant-2:    KEGArawashii wa_.>
attendant-2: That's filthy!

(    Strictly speaking while 'hime' ('hime-sama' with full honourifics) does
literally translate as 'princess', the woman being refered to as a
'princess' is not necessarily one in the traditional sense - ie daughter of
the king of the country - or in Japan's case, the emperor. However, at the
time, Japan was more like a set of smaller countries, though without
'kings'. In this case, a more accurate term would probably be 'lady',
though it's harder to fit this in, grammar-wise.)

2
[Closeup of the man being beaten up - he has dark rimmed eyes. Looks a bit
like a nastier and older version of Gosunkugi from Ranma 1/2.]
<man:    wa, washi wa tada,>
man: I, I was just [doing so],
<man:    hime ga amari ni oUTSUKUshii no de...>
man: because the princess was too beautiful...

3
[Miroku stands among a group of onlookers.]
Fx villagers: *mutter mutter* <Sawa Sawa>
<villager-1:    are wa ESHI no KOUTATSU ja.>
villager-1: That's that artist, Koutatsu.
<villager-2:    MIYAKO kara NAGArete kita chuu UWASA no...
In this case, 'nagarete kita' means that he came here after vagrancy,
or that he is an outsider originated from the capital. Anyway, this
expression means "He's rumoured to have come from the capital" in a
derogatory sense.
>
villager-2: He's a foreigner rumoured to have come down from the capital...

4
[Closeup of Miroku's eye's tightening.]
Fx Miroku: *take a sharp look* <Su_ *guess*>
<Miroku:    n...?>
Miroku: .oO(Hn...?).
<Miroku:    ano ESHI...>
Miroku: .oO(That artist...).

5
[Closeup of the artist, with swirly patterns drawn over.]
<Miroku:    nanka... WARUi mon ni toriTSUkarete...>
Miroku: .oO(Somehow I think... an obsession seems to have driven him bad...).

6
[Closeup of the princess turning around with a gentle expression.]
<princess:    kore,>
princess: Now then!
<princess:    anmari hidoku shinaide...>
princess: Don't treat him too cruelly...

[Closeup of Miroku, looking a little surprised.]

[The princess and party leaves, leaving the artist lying on the ground.]
Fx attendant: (at Koutatsu) *spit* <pe_>
Koutatsu: ......
<attendant:    sa, mairimashou HIME-sama.>
attendant: Okay, let's depart, hime-sama.

2
[Closeup side view of the princess.]
<Miroku:    UTSUKUshii ga...>
Miroku: .oO(She's beautiful...).

3
[Closeup of Miroku thinking.]
<Miroku:    KAGE no USUi HIME-san da na.>
Miroku: .oO(But the hime-san looks shadowed by death.).
<Miroku:    kocchi wa HOUttoku to NAGAkunee.>
Miroku: .oO(She won't live long if I leave her alone.).

(    Miroku the delinquent, thinking to himself, is using the less honorific
-san instead of -sama, showing again that he really just puts on a good,
polite face for others, particularly the girls.)

4
[Miroku turns to look at the artist, who is picking himself off the ground.]
Fx Koutatsu: *stagger...* <Yoro...>
Miroku: ......

5
[Miroku turns to look at the princess, and party.]
Fx princess: *cough cough* <keho keho>
<attendant:    HIME-sama DAIJOUBU desu ka?>
attendant: Hime-sama, are you allright?

6
[Miroku walks off after the princess.]
<Miroku:    yappa...>
Miroku: .oO(On second thought...).
<Miroku:    ONNA SUKUu HOU ga SAKI darou.>
Miroku: .oO(It's better to help out the girl first, isn't it.).



Page 8

[Koutatsu is now walking down an empty road beside a river.]
Fx Koutatsu: shh <Za...>
<Koutatsu:    kuso_,>

4
[View of the princess drawn on the paper.]
<Koutatsu:    aa, HIRUMA no HIME mo mata UTSUKUshii.>
Koutatsu: Aha-ah, the princess is beautiful during the day as well.
<Koutatsu:    mou sugu washi dake no mono...>
Koutatsu: She'll be mine alone soon...

5
[Side view of Inuyasha's hand stretching out and yanking back the artist by
his collar.]
Fx Inuyasha: *yank* <Gui>
<Koutatsu:    hi_.>
Koutatsu: Eep.



Page 9
1
[Koutatsu turns to see Inuyasha looking down at him balefully.]
<Inuyasha:    ou,>
Inuyasha: Hey there,
<Inuyasha:    chotto Tsura KAshi na.>
Inuyasha: Let's step aside and have a little talk, okay.
<Koutatsu:    na_.>
Koutatsu: Wha!

(    Inuyasha is using lines typically used by a bad guy again. A typical use of
Inuyasha line would be - somebody happens to be involved in a trouble with
a street gang (or delinquent, 'yakuza' or whatever), and the bad guy side
says this line to ask him to move to a different place in order to talk
about the matter more closely. (Of course, it is often the case that the
"talk" doesn't end up with a "talk" in this case...))


2
[Kagome is rushing up on her bike.]
Fx bike: swish <Sha--...>
<Kagome:    a_.>
Kagome: Ah!
<Kagome:    mo~~ INUYASHA mata_...>
Kagome: She~e~esh, Inuyasha's at it again...

[Closeup of the artist.]
<Koutatsu:    na, nanja kisama wa...>
Koutatsu: Wha, what'd ya want, arsehole...
<Koutatsu:    wa, washi wa tada no ESHI...>
Koutatsu: I, I'm just an artist...

4
[Closeup side view of Inuyasha thinking.]
<Inuyasha:    n...?>
Inuyasha: Hn...?
<Inuyasha:    SUMI... dake ja nee.>
Inuyasha: .oO(Ink... but that's not all.).

5
[Closeup of Inuyasha.]
<Inuyasha:    omee...>
Inuyasha: Hey you...
<Inuyasha:    HITO no CHI to KIMO no NIOi ga punpun suru ze.>
Inuyasha: You reek of the smell of people's blood and guts.

front of him, which has a huge weapon - a long pole with a crescent shaped
blade - very much like the Gekkaja from the last Ranma 1/2 story.]
