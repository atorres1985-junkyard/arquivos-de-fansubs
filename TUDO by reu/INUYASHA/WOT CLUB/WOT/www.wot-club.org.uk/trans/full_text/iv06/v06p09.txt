Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

Inuyasha: Don't act like you're the only one allowed to be cool, you stupid shit!

(    Inuyasha is referring to how Miroku 'acted cool' all by himself earlier in
this chapter, when he told Inuyasha and Kagome to get behind him. Inuyasha
also hints that he wants to do such things as well...)

2
[Long distance view of Kagome and Miroku, looking faintly surprised.]

[Closeup of Kagome looking up.]

[Kagome speaks, while looking off at Inuyasha and has these little sparkles
around her, while Miroku looks a bit blank.]

<Kagome:    {speaking as if Inuyasha} ato wa ore ni makasero.>
Kagome:  leave the rest to me."
<Kagome:    tte...>
Kagome: He said...
<Miroku:    so- wa KIkoe masenshita ga.>
Miroku: It didn't come across like that.

(    Kagome is used to Inuyasha's rude way of speaking, and she decides to
re-interpret what Inuyasha's saying for Miroku's benifit, so as to reduce
tension in the group, and also to emphasise what she considers to be
Inuyasha's (probably) good intentions. While Kagome's interpretation is
sort of correct, it sounds completely different, hence Miroku's comment.)

<Inuyasha:    temeera ni YOU wa nee!!>
Inuyasha: I've got no business with you!!

2
[Miroku looks on in surprise and appears impressed, and Kagome's a bit
surprised too.]
<Miroku:    oo_,>
Miroku: Wow,
<Miroku:    are wa dou iu JUTSU desu ka.>
Miroku: what kind of [martial arts] attack is that?
<Kagome:    ... tada NAGUtteru no.>
Kagome: ... He's just pounding them.



Page 18

[Inuyasha has gotten quite close to the artist.]
