Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

slung over his shoulder. Some (maple?) leaves drift past him in the breeze.]
<Title:    FURYOU HOUSHI>
Title: Delinquent Priest


(    'Houshi' is a term for a low ranking Buddhist priest, and also often refers
to a one who travels around, and has combat training. 'yakata', with -sama,
is a term meaning something like "master of the house". "o-yakata-sama" is
a more polite and formal variation.)

[View of a small estate out in the county in feudal Japan.]
<yakata:    KONDO koso HONTOU ni TOKU no TAKAi HOUSHI de arou na_.>
yakata: {off} _This_ time, a good priest has really appeared, right!?

2
[In the courtyard of the building, an old man is on his knees in front of
the master of the house.]
<servant:    haa~>
servant: Yes m'lord.
<servant:    go-HONNIN wa sou IiHAttoru daga...>
servant: The gentleman insisted that he is so, but...
<yakata:    maa yoi TOOse,
                    imperative of toosu
>
yakata: Well, that doesn't matter - let him in,
<yakata:    SHPPAI shitara itsumo no you ni tatakiDAse.>
yakata: if he fails, then kick him out as per normal.

3
[Outside the walls of the estate, a young man is leaning against the wall,
dressed in Buddhist priest style clothing. He has two small rings in his
left ear, an one in his right, has a small pony-tail, is carrying a long
thin staff called a 'shakujou', (for those who're familiar with Slayers,
it's like the one Rezo has - standard Buddhist priest type prop) and has
some sort of long glove around his right hand and arm, with a string of
beads around it.]
<servant:    HOUSHI-SAMA,>
servant: Houshi-sama,
<servant:    o-HARAi dekinandara KAYU IPPAI DAsen chu- koto daga...
                     if able to do?         dasen chuu (dasenai to iu) 
>
servant: [master said that] if you fail to perform the exorcism, he won't serve you even a bowl of (rice) gruel...
<houshi:    KEKKOU desu yo.>
houshi: That's fine.

[A flash back to several months ago of a woman in a kimono with long hair
suddenly falling down.]
<yakata:    HIME ga TAOrete mou MITSUKI...>
yakata: {voice over} It's already been 3 months since the princess collapsed...
<yakata:    arayuru KUSURI o tameshita ga IKKOU ni YOkunarazu,>
yakata: We've tried every kind of medicine but it done no good at all,
<yakata:    mohaya HOTOKE ni sugaru shika nai to...>
yakata: and so we could only turn to Buddha...

2
[In a room in the estate, the young priest is sitting before the master of
the house, and looking back at a pile of sparkling packages.]
<houshi:    iya, kono SENRAN no go-JISEI ni YOi oKUrashi buri de...
'iya,' = interjection of admiration/envy
>
houshi: My my, you're living in fine style for this age of wars...
<houshi:    RYOUMIN kara sazo ya URAmarete...>
houshi: _I'm sure_ that the local fiefdom has grudge against you...
<yakata:    yakamashii.>
yakata: Silence!

3
[The scene now moves to another room, which has a large Buddha statue, and
lying in front is a woman with long hair (presumablely the aforementioned
princess), and the master is standing in the doorway.]
<yakata:    HIME ya, HOUSHI-SAMA ga mierareta zo.>
yakata: Princess, the houshi-sama has arrived.

[Now the priest is crouching near the princess, and we can see her rather
plump face for the first time. Nearby the master is looking somewhat miffed.]
<yakata:    aa, konna ni oKAO ga HArete.>
yakata: Ah-a, her face is so swollen.
<houshi:    motomoto ja.>
houshi: It's her natural face!

2
[Closeup of the priest looking to the side, and up.]

3
[View of the Buddha statue.]
<houshi:    ano AMIDA-sama wa...?>
houshi: That Amida-sama is...?

(    "Amida-sama" is Amitabha, a Buddhist deity.)

4
[The priest comes to look close at the statue.]
<yakata:    KUitsumeta KIZOKU kara MORAi Uketa, arigatai HOTOKE-sama ja.>
yakata: That is a virtuous Buddha [statue] I got from a nobleman who'd gone broke.
<houshi:    haa~>
houshi: Hm~m

5
[The priest looks closely at the face of the statue, which now has several
sweat drops.]
houshi: ......

6
[The priest turns back to the master of the house.]
<houshi:    wakarimashita.>
houshi: I understand.
<houshi:    o-YAKATA-sama, HIME-SAMA o NOKOshite IE no MONO o MINA YSHIKI no SOTO ni.>
houshi: o-Yakata-sama, leave the princess behind, and take everyone inside the house outside of the mansion.
<houshi:    soshite... yoroshii ka?>
houshi: And... this is important, okay?



Page 5
1
[Closeup of the priest looking serious.]
<houshi:    dono you na MONO OTO ga shitemo,>
houshi: No matter what the sound is,
<houshi:    KESshite nozoite wa ikemasen.>
houshi: you must never peep in.

2
[View of the master looking worried.]
<yakata:    u... umu.>
yakata: O... okay.

3
[Now, the priest extends his staff towards the Buddha statue from several
paces back.]
Fx staff: cling... <Chari...>
<houshi:    sate,>
houshi: Now then,
<houshi:    otonashiku DEteIkeba JIHI no KOKORO de oYURUshi shiyou.>
houshi: If you come out peacefully, I'll show mercy out of goodness of my heart.

4
[Closeup of the statue now growing fangs around it's mouth, and it's eyes
look menacing.]
Fx teeth: *slowly extend...* <Gigi...>



Page 6
1
[The Buddha statue has now grown long teeth, it's ears have become pointed,
and it seems to be growing fur.]
Fx teeth: *slowly extend* <Gichi Gichi Gichi Gichi>

2
[Closeup of the priest holding his staff out, smiling slightly.]
<houshi:    ... tte, SUNAO ni KIku wake nee ka.>
houshi: ... So, you won't listen to reason and come quietly, huh.

3
[Suddenly a huge wolf-like monster blasts out from the statue, while the
priest looks on smiling.]
Fx blast: *flash* <Ba Ba_>
Fx wolf: whoosh <Sha---_>
<houshi:    fu_,>
houshi: Heh,
<houshi:    SHOUTAI wa BAke Itachi kai!>
houshi: so a weasel-monster is your true shape!



Page 7

[A closeup of the weasel-monster shows a glowing Shikon fragment.]
Fx fragment: *glow...* <Pou...>

2
[Closeup side view of the priest looking surprised and interested.]
<houshi:    n!? ano HIKARI...>
houshi: .oO(Hn? That light's...).

3
[The priest is suddenly above the monster and smashes his staff onto the top
of it's head.]
Fx houshi: (striking) wham <Doga>
Fx weasel: sque-e-e-l <Giiiii>
<houshi:    SHIKON no kakera ka!?>
houshi: is a Shikon fragment!?

4
[Outside the house, many people are standing looking on.]
<voice:    na, nan ja? KEdamono no HIMEI...!?>
voice: Wh, what the? A scream of some beast...!?
<voice:    NAKA de nani ga...>
voice: What's going on in there...



Page 8
1
[View of the old servant from earlier and the master of the house.]
<servant:    o-YAKATA-sama, nozoite miru ka ne?>
servant: O-Yakata-sama, shouldn't we try to look in?
<yakata:    i, iya MAte...>
yakata: N, no, wait...

2
[Closeup side view of the master.]
<yakata:    YOi to iu made KESshite nozokuna to Itte otta shi,>
yakata: He said to never look in until he gave the okay,
<yakata:    AKURYOU-BARAi no tobacchiri o ukete wa kanawan.>
yakata: and I'm afraid we might get involved with the evil spirit being exorcised.

3
[The people continue to look at the house.]
Fx sounds: clatter <Gatata>
Fx sounds: thud <Dota_>
<servant:    o-YAKATA-sama, nanka...>
servant: O-Yakata-sama, something is...
<servant:    YA SAGAshi shitoru yo- na OTO dake n'do...
                                                n'kedo?
>
servant: Sounds like he's hunting around the house, but...
<yakata:    ima shibaraku_.>
yakata: Just a little more!

4
[View of some darkening skies as sunset approaches, and some crows fly
though the air. By the way, crows are sometimes used in a cliche way to
indicate people acting like fools - in Japanese, a crow's caw ('aho') is
also a word for 'fool'.]
Fx crow: caw <Aho->

5
[View of the weasel from earlier, but much smaller, and lying (dead?) on
some floorboards.]
<yakata:    kono CHIsa na Itachi ga BAkete...>
yakata: You say that this little weasel was a monster and...
<yakata:    HIME no TAMASHII o KUrai TSUZUkete otta to MOUsu ka.>
yakata: continued to eat your soul, princess?

6
[The master is holding the weasel in one hand looking at the princess, who
is standing up, looking dreamily happy. A panicky looking servant is coming
around the corner of the house.]
<yakata:    sorede HOUSHI wa...?>
yakata: So where's the priest...?
Fx princess: (comically) *space out* <po--_>
<princess:    NA mo TSUgezu ni sawayaka ni SAtte Ikaremashita.>
princess: Without even giving his name, he left in an stylish manner.
Fx servant: (running) thud thud <Dotata_>
<servant:    o, o-YAKTA-sama---_!>
servant: O, o-Yakata-sama-a-a-a!

[White frame.]
<servant:    KANAme no MONO ZENBU MOtte karetori masu--_.
                                  motte ikarete ori masu
>
servant: Everything of monetary value has been taken!
<servant:    UMA mo-_.>
servant: Horses too!


(    This first part of the chapter is probably indended to be a parody of a
Japanese folklore tale, called 'Tsuru no on-gaeshi', where (vastly
simplified) someone turns up to help someone else with a problem, and tells
them not to peek on them doing the work. In full it is as follows...<br>
One day, a young man saves a crane caught by a trap and released the crane.
Then, a young woman visits his house and starts to serve him as the wife.
She goes into a room and does nice weaving every night, and it makes a good
amount of money. However, she says to the man that he should not look
inside the room when she is in the room. Out of curiosity, he finally
peeked inside the room when she works on the cloth, and finds that the true
form of his wife is the crane he saved, and it turns out the she has been
making cloth from her own feather. Since she noticed that the man learned
her identity, she flew away and never comes back again. The man regrets
that he broke the promise that he shouldn't look inside.)

[The priest is sitting on one of three horses pulling a wagon filled with stuff.]
Fx wagon: creak <Gi_>
<houshi:    sate doko ni Uritobashi masu ka.>
houshi: Now, where shall I sell off this stuff?



Page 9

[Kagome is cycling along on her bike in her usual school clothes, with
Shippou sitting on the back of the bike, and Inuyasha talking behind them.]
Fx bike: (bell) jingle <chiririn>
<Shippou:    kagome,>
Shippou: Kagome,
<Shippou:    yapparai INUYASHA okashii zo.>
Shippou: don't you think Inuyasha's been acting weird too.
<Kagome:    so- yo nee-.>
Kagome: Yeah, rather.

2
[View of Inuyasha walking along, looking off to the side with a vacant look.]

3
[Shippou suddenly jumps up in front of Inuyasha and whacks him on the head.]
Fx Shippou: *whack* <Pen>
<Shippou:    kuora, suttoko dokkoi.
                    blockhead (very insulting)
>
Shippou: Hey, shit fer brains.

4
[Inuyasha is now glaring at Shippou who's being held by the base of his
tail, and has a lump on his head.]
Fx Shippou: (lump) clunk... <mishi...>
<Inuyasha:    urusee na,>
Inuyasha: Pipe down,
<Inuyasha:    KANGAe goto shite n-no ni.>
Inuyasha: I thinking about stuff.
<Shippou:    sore ga okashii to itto n-no ja_.>
Shippou: That's what I'm saying is strange!

[Closeup of Shippou shouting angrily.]
<Shippou:    Bo---------tto shi kusatte.
             be absentminded    + insulting tone
>
Shippou: Hey, mi-i-i-ster head-in-the-clouds.
<Shippou:    SHIKON no TAMA o ATSUmeru KI ga aru no ka!?>
Shippou: Don't you want to collect the Shikon no Tama together!?

2
[White frame.]
<Inuyasha:    wakaranaku natte kita...>
Inuyasha: .oO(I'm not certain any more...).
<Inuyasha:    TAMA o ATSUmete HONMONO no YOUKAI ni natte...>

<voice:    a-a chikusho- me.>
voice: Ah-a, those crap-heads.

2
[The young priest from earlier is sitting in an Onsen (hot spring), in which
a few monkeys are also sitting, and he's rubbing his shoulders.]
Fx priest: *cracking bones in neck/shoulder* <kokyu kokyu>
<houshi:    DOUGUYA no YAROU KAitataki yagatte.>
houshi: Those bastards at the tool shop pay crap.
<houshi:    HAKObu no TAIHEN datta no ni yo.>
houshi: And transporting the stuff was such a pain.

(    Unlike earlier when he was speaking quite politely, the priest is now
speaking roughly - as badly as Inuyasha does.)

3
[The priest holds up the Shikon fragment.]
<houshi:    SHUUKAKU wa kono...>
houshi: Of all the bounty...
<houshi:    SHIKON no kakera kuree ka...>
houshi: just this Shikon fragment is left, huh...
<houshi:    ATSUmannee naa~>
houshi: They're hard to collect, aren't they.

4
[The priest turns at sound nearby.]
Fx sound: splish <Za_>
<voice:    kya~_ ONSEN da~>
voice: Kya~a! It's an Onsen!
<voice:    UREshi-_.>

[The priest continues to look on while Kagome turns to look back to the bank.]
<Kagome:    INUYASHA-,>
Kagome: Inuyasha-a,
<Kagome:    ZETTAI nozokanai de yo-.>
Kagome: Absolutely don't peek now.



Page 13

[Up near the bank, Inuyasha is sitting with his back to a tree, while Kagome
looks back at him with an annoyed expression.]
<Inuyasha:    SHINPAIsun na,>
Inuyasha: Don't worry,
<Inuyasha:    KYOUMI ne- kara yo.>
Inuyasha: as that doesn't interest me.
<Kagome:    ma~_.>

look at Inuyasha.]

Inuyasha: Hey wait.
<Shippou:    INUYASHA, omae mo KOi.>

[Inuyasha looks at Shippou with several sweat drops.]
<Inuyasha:    e''.>
Inuyasha: _Eh_.
<Shippou:    ora wa TSUNZUNE FUSHIGI ni OMOtto tta n-ja ga...>

Page 14

[Closeup of Shippou, speaking forcefully and as if confused.]
<Shippou:    nande omae wa kagome to FURO ni haira n-no ja.>
Shippou: Why don't you bathe with Kagome?
<Shippou:    minna ISSHOU no HOU ga TANOshii dewa nai ka.>
Shippou: Wouldn't be it more fun with everyone?

2
[Inuyasha continues to hold Shippou's tail while the kid tries to move.]
<Inuyasha:    ano na.>
Inuyasha: Hey you.
<Shippou:    ora wa otou ya okkaa ga Ikiteta KORO, itsumo ISSHOU ni haitto tta!>
Shippou: When Otou and Okkaa were alive, we always went in together.

(    'Okkaa' and 'Otou' are Shippou's slangy variations for 'mother' and 'father'.)

3
[Inuyasha glares condescendingly at Inuyasha, while Shippou whispers to Inuyasha.]
<Inuyasha:    ome- wa Gaki dakara wakanne- daro- kedo na...>

back with wide-eyed innocence.]

[Inuyasha continues to look.]

6
[Inuyasha is now angrily throttling Shippou by the neck.]
<Inuyasha:    nande ome- ni sonna koto KOKUHAKU shinakya nanne- n'da yo_.>
Inuyasha: There's no reason for me to confess such a thing to you!

7
[Side view of Kagome stretching out her arms.]

[The scene expands to show that a monkey had grabbed Kagome's hair. Shippou
is in the spring near the rock Kagome's at, looking at the monkey, while
Kagome has dumped a large rock on top of Inuyasha's head, holding him down
in the water. Inuyasha's hand (just breaking the surface) has assumed that
classic first and forth finger extended pose that we haven't seen since
volume 2.]
Fx Kagome: (dumping rock on top of Inuyasha) clunk... <mishi...>
Fx Inuyasha: *glub glub* <boko_>
<Kagome:    DAIJOUBU dakara DEtette.>

Fx monkey: eek <ki_>
Fx monkey: *scritch scritch* <pori>
<Shippou:    Saru ja.>
Shippou: It's a monkey.

2
[Just outside the spring, the priest has put his clothes back on, and is
looking out onto the spring.]
<houshi:    YAROU ZUre ka...>
houshi: .oO(She's accompanied by a guy, huh...).
<houshi:    maitta na.>
houshi: .oO(That's too bad.).

3
[View of the priest flexing the hand which has that glove on it.]
Fx priest: (putting on clothes) *quietly* <koso>

<Kagome:    mo~ itsu made OKOtte n-no yo~>
Kagome: {off} Jeez, how long are you going to be angry for.

2
[View of Kagome speaking to someone off-frame, looking a little angry
herself, and embarrassed.]
<Kagome:    anta datte atashi no HADAKA MIta n'dakara oaiko desho-.>
Kagome: Because you saw me naked, you should see it as a favour shouldn't you.

3
[Kagome is pushing her bike while walking along. A little behind, Inuyasha
is looking angrily to the side. Kagome moves to talk to Shippou who's
sitting in the basket.]
<Inuyasha:    MItenee_!>
Inuyasha: I didn't see!
<Kagome:    MIta yo ne-_.>
Kagome: He did see didn't he.
<Shippou:    ora kara wa nantomo...>
