Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

(    "I am not a suspicious person" (in response to a who are you type question)
is one of those phrases people _always_ use in these kinds of situations in
anime and manga. Well, nearly - there's this story in the Slayers Special
novels where Lina Inverse burts into a building, and some people confront
her and demand to know who she is, and she replies that she's "a suspicious
person", which completely stumps the guys for several seconds ^-^)
