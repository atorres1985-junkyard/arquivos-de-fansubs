Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

from under the chest area of his Buddhist robes.]

<Miroku:    to, nareba.>

[View of the artist's house at night.]
Fx wind: who-o-sh <Hyuuu...>

[Closeup of a sketch of the princess.]

3
[The artist is pacing back and forth near a large sketch of the princess,
which looks like an outline for the chapter picture on page 1.]
Fx Koutatsu: *flustered* <uro uro>
<Koutatsu:    HIME...>
Koutatsu: The princess...

[The 'princess' turns to face Koutatsu, but she has a really daft looking
face - big eyes with tiny cross-eyed irises and so on, rather like things
Shippou has done before.]

3
[The 'princess' changes back into Shippou.]
Fx Shippou: (transforming) *pomph* <doron>
Fx mists: *clatter* <Gara_>

(    It seems that it's harder for Shippou to hold a more accurate, and more
complicated, illusion. It's hard to gauge, but Shippou might have been
holding the illusion for anywhere between 10 minutes and a few hours. Those
of you who have seen Pon-poko may remember the difficulties the Tanuki had
in keeping up a complicated illusion - and mimicking humans was
particularly hard.)

[Shippou turns to see the artist standing in front of him, with dark swirls
of energy coming from him.]

[Closeup of Shippou acting defiantly.]
<Shippou:    fu_, barete shimattra shouga nai nou.>
Shippou: Heh, shame about being exposed.
<Shippou:    ora wa...>
Shippou: I am...

2
[The artist turns to leave, and the Oni attack Shippou with their weapons.]
Fx Koutatsu: *turn around* <Kuru>
<Koutatsu:    KOROse.>
Koutatsu: Kill it.
Fx oni-1: *weapon hitting floor* whump <Doka>
Fx oni-2: *weapon hitting floor* whump <Doka>

<Shippou:    wa-n.>

Fx mist: whosh <Ba_>



Page 16-17

[Double-page of a huge group of mounted Oni rushing towards the party.
Miroku has gotten off the bike, and Kagome's gotten off Inuyasha's shoulder.]
Fx oni: rumble-rumble-rumble <Dodododo>
group: !
<Kagome:    ko, kore wa...>
Kagome: The, they're...
<Inuyasha:    E da!>
Inuyasha: drawings!
<Miroku:    e..!?>
Miroku: Drawings...!?

[Closeup of Inuyasha making a point.]
<Inuyasha:    yatsu wa E ni KAita ONI o AYATSUru JUTSU o MOtte iru n-da.
'yatsu' is emphasised.

Inuyasha: _That guy_ has a spell controlling the Oni he's drawn.
<Inuyasha:    daga, kono ONI-domo kokeodoshi ja nee.>
Inuyasha: However, these Oni aren't a bluff.

2
[View of Koutatsu with several unrolled scrolls, from which mounted Oni of
coming from as they unroll.]
Fx scrolls: fwip <Ba_>
<Koutatsu:    kukuku... KUi KOROshite kureru...>

3
[Inuyasha charges forwards with Tetsusaiga drawn (and Kagome on his back),
and Miroku comes up behind him with his staff.]
Fx Inuyasha: fwip <Za_>
<Inuyasha:    MIROKU,>
Inuyasha: Miroku,
<Inuyasha:    kowakattara KAEtte mo ii n-da ze!>
Inuyasha: If you're scared you may return!
<Miroku:    nan no,>
Miroku: No chance,
<Miroku:    kore wa WATASHI no SHIGOTO desu!>
Miroku: This is my job!
