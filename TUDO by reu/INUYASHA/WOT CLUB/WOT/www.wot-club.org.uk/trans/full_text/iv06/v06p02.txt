Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

[Kikyou staggers away from Inuyasha and the others by Urasue's kiln.]
Fx Kikyou: *stagger...* <Yoro...>
<Kikyou:    ku_...>
Kikyou: Ugh...
<Inuyasha:    KIKYOU...>
Inuyasha: Kikyou...

2
[Closeup of Inuyasha looking a little surprised.]
<Kaede:    mada TAMASHII ga NOKOtte iru no ka?>
Kaede: {off} Some of the soul still remains?

3
[Inuyasha and Kaede turn at the sound of a voice.]
<Urasue:    ano KARADA o UGOkasu no wa KIKYOU no ONNEN yo...>
Urasue: {off} Kikyou's malice is driving that body...
Inuyasha: !

4
[Closeup of Urasue's head - the body was blown off earlier.]
Fx Urasue: (neck) *sizzle...* <Hyu----... **guessing*>
<Urasue:    hihi...>

[View of Kagome lying on the floor with her eyes closed, and Shippou sitting
next to her, looking at her in concern.]
<Urasue:    arakata no TAMASHII wa sono KOMUSUME no KARADA ni KAEtta rashii ga...
            most
>
Urasue: It seems that most of the soul has returned to that wench's body, but...

2
[Kaede and Inuyasha look on at Urasue's head, speaking from the stony ground.]
Fx Urasue: (neck) *sizzle...* <Hyuu---...>
<Urasue:    "IN no KI" no ONNEN dake wa,>
Urasue: It appears that only the "dark feelings" of malice,
<Urasue:    HONE to HAKATSUCHI o MOCHIi, waga KIJUTSU ni te TSUKUrishi KARADA ni...>
Urasue: have become highly suited to...
<Urasue:    yohodo yoku najinda to mieru...>
Urasue: the body I made with Oni-art using the bones and burial soil...

(    Urasue means that when the soul was wrenched back from Kikyou, the "dark
feelings" stayed there, which means that this Kikyou doesn't have all her
proper feelings.)

[Kaede looks at Inuyasha with a sad expression, while Kagome continues to
lie on the floor in the background.]
<Kaede:    mada MEZAmenu.>
Kaede: She still hasn't awoken.
<Kaede:    ... KIKYOU-onee-sama wa doushita.>
Kaede: ... What happened to Kikyou-onee-sama?

Shippou: When she opens her eyes,
<Shippou:    chanto moto no kagome ni MODOru n-ja rou na.>
Shippou: will she have returned to the proper Kagome, I wonder.

3
[Inuyasha starts in surprise, while Kaede just looks on.]

4
[View of Kagome lying on the ground.]

2
[Kaede and the others look on in surprise and worry.]
<Kaede:    kagome...>
Kaede: Kagome...

[Kagome starts hugging herself, shivering in fright, while Kaede and Shippou
look on in concern.]

Shippou: That Inuyasha, he doesn't look happy at all.
<Kaede:    MURI mo nai,>
Kaede: Not surprising;
<Kaede:    shibaraku sotto shite okou.>
Kaede: Let's leave him alone for a bit.

5
[Kagome looks on at Inuyasha who is looking away from her.]

6
[Closeup of Kagome looking a little peeved.]

4
[Closeup of Kagome smiling happily. Very cute.]

<Kagome:    yatto atashi no KAomita.>
Kagome: At last you looked at my face.

5
[Inuyasha is taken aback.]
<Inuyasha:    e...>
Inuyasha: Eh...

(    Kagome _deliberately_ teased Inuyasha in a way calculated to make him look
at her, and she is also rejecting Inuyasha's claim that Kikyou and Kagome
don't resemble each other. Kagome also recognises that Inuyasha has a
particular emotional response in regard to Kikyou, and Inuyasha sort of
admits this.)



Page 18

[Inuyasha walks in front of Kagome, looking angry (or is it embarrassed?)
while Kagome continues to happily talk to him from behind.]
<Kagome:    OKOtteta HOU ga INUYASHA rashi- yo.>

[Kaede and Shippou look on.]
<Shippou:    ... GENKI ga DEta mitai ja na.>
Shippou: ... Looks like he's recovered.
<Kaede:    un...>
Kaede: Yeah...

4
[View of Kaede thinking.]
<Kaede:    kagome... FUSHIGI na KO da...>
Kaede: .oO(Kagome... you're a strange child...).

[Misty frame.]
<Kaede:    KIKYOU-onee-sama no TSUYOi TAMASHII sura,>
Kaede: .oO(Even Kikyou-onee-sama's powerful soul,).
<Kaede:    kagome ni wa KAtenakatta.>
