Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

[View of a large Japanese style castle on the side of a hill.]
<attendant:    OKU-GATA-SAMA.>
attendant: {off} oku-gata-sama.
<attendant:    WAKA-SAMA wa, yoku oYASUmi ni natte orare masu yo.>
attendant: Waka-sama is now sleeping well.

(    Oku-gata-sama" here is a title of address for the wife of the lord of the
castle. "Waka-sama" is the title for the lord's son and heir.)

2
[Inside the castle the lady and some attendants are sitting around the baby.]
<lady:    HONTOU ni...>
lady: He certainly is...
<attendant:    YONAki mo nasarazu,>
attendant: He doesn't cry at night either.
<attendant:    hon ni yoi WAKO-sama desu.>
attendant: He sure is a good baby.

3
[Closeup of the baby. (This is of course the other "Naraku Jr", though this
one is staying as a baby it seems)]

4
[Closeup side view of the lady.]
<lady:    marude ano YORU no OSOroshii DEKIGOTO ga YUME no you da.>
lady: .oO(It's almost as if the events of that terrible night were a dream.).

[Flashback drawing of the dead attendants.]
<lady:    WATASHI ga kono YO o Unda ano YORU...>
lady: .oO(On that night when _I gave birth to this child_...).
<lady:    SANSHITSU ni IAwaseta MONO-tachi ga MINA, ZETSUMEIshi, soshite...>
lady: .oO(all those who were present in the birthing-room died, and then...).

2
[Vague drawing of Kanna and Kohaku.]
<lady:    sono ATO NANIMONOka ga...>
lady: .oO(after that someone...).

3
[Closeup side view of the lady thinking.]
lady: ......
<lady:    OMOiDAsenai...>
lady: .oO(I can't remember...).

4
[Misty frame.]
<lady:    HIgoto ni ano YORU no KIOKU ga USUrete iku.>
lady: .oO(My memories of that night have faded daily.).

5
[Outside in front of the room where the lady is sitting, Kohaku walks past
carrying some firewood.]
<old man:    KOHAKU, socchi ni Iku na.>
old man: {off} Kohaku, don't go that way.

6
[Closeup of Kohaku, with a closeup of the lady overlaid.]
lady: !

[Kohaku looks at the lady as she comes out of the room to take a closer look
at Kohaku. Shortly behind Kohaku an old man worriedly approaches.]
<lady:    kore...>
lady: He's...
<old man:    a,>
old man: Ah,
<old man:    OKU-GATA-SAMA, MOUshiWAKE gozai masen.>
old man: oku-gata-sama, I'm terribly sorry.

2
[The old man kneels on the ground, and makes Kohaku do the same.]
<old man:    kono MONO wa SHITA BATARAki ni haitta bakkari de,>
old man: This person has only just become a servant,
<old man:    mada NArete ori masen mono de...>
old man: so he isn't used to it yet...

(    The old man is worried about Kohaku (and himself as he's responsible for
Kohaku most likely) because in those days, servants (and the lower classes
in general) could be executed for basically no reason. Since Kohaku didn't
quite follow the rules, the nastier sorts of nobles could have had him
beaten or killed.)

3
[Closeup of the lady.]
<lady:    ii no desu. sore yori...>
lady: I don't mind. Anyway...
<lady:    KAO o yoku MIsete.>
lady: let me see you face properly.

4
[Kohaku looks up.]
<Kohaku:    ha.>
Kohaku: Yes ma'am.

5
[Closeup of the lady.]
<lady:    dokoka de...>
lady: Haven't I...
<lady:    Atta koto wa nai ka?>
lady: seen you somewhere before?



Page 5

[View of the anxious old man, and Kohaku looking at him.]
<old man:    tondemonee.>
old man: That wouldn't be possible.
<old man:    kono KO wa OKU-GATA-SAMA ni oAi-suru you na MIBUN dewa...>
old man: This child wouldn't have met someone of your stature, oku-gata-sama...
<old man:    naa?>
old man: {to Kohaku} Right?
<Kohaku:    hai.>
Kohaku: Right.

2
[Closeup of the lady.]
<lady:    sou ka...>
lady: I see...
<lady:    WATASHI no OMOisugoshi ka.>
lady: I guess it was just my imagination.

[Kohaku and the old man are now in the servants quarters.]
<Kohaku:    OKU-GATA-SAMA, YASAshisou na HITO da ne.>
Kohaku: The oku-gata-sama seems to be a nice person.
<old man:    aa.>
old man: Indeed.

5
[FlashBack Flashback close of Naraku.
<Naraku:    KOHAKU omae wa...>
Naraku: Kohaku, you will...
<Naraku:    KANNA to tomo ni SHIRO ni todomari,>

<Naraku:    AKAGO o MAMOre.>
Naraku: and protect the baby.
