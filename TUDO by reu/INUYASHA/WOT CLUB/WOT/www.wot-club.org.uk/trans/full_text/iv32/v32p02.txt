Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

<Inuyasha:    Ou wake ni ikanee daro.>

5
[Sango turns to talk to Inuyasha. Miroku's expression suggests he was
thinking something similar.]
<Sango:    jaa, kagome-chan ga WARAtte OKUriDAshite kuretara, Okkakete-ta n-da ne.>
Sango: Then, if Kagome had sent you off with a smile, you would have gone, huh?

6
[Inuyasha digests this.]
Inuyasha: ......

(    Basically, Inuyasha should consider Kagome's feelings (in advance) more.)

<Inuyasha:    HIJIRI-sama ni Atta.>

Kagome: She was wounded and sleeping...
<Kagome:    kedo...>
Kagome: But...
<Kagome:    SHOUKI o JOUKA dekita kara... mou DAIJOUBU da to OMOu.>
Kagome: since the miasma could be purified... I think she'll be okay now.

3
[Inuyasha looks at Kagome.]
Inuyasha: ......
<Inuyasha:    omae ga yatte kureta no ka?>
Inuyasha: You did that for her?

4
[Kagome is still looking at the ground, but doesn't seem depressed anymore.]
<Kagome:    ...un.>

rather incensed.]

Kagome: Did I really say that?
<Inuyasha:    na"_...>
Inuyasha: _Wha_...
<Inuyasha:    ore ga dore dake KIZUtsuita to...>
Inuyasha: Don't you realise how much that hurt me...!

6
[Sango, Miroku and Shippou look on.]
<Sango:    KI ni shite-ta n-da.>
Sango: That's what he was worried about.
<Shippou:    SHOUSHINMONO ja...
** shoushin = timid / cowardly. But that doesn't make sense here.
>
Shippou: What a petty guy...

(    Basically, Inuyasha seemed more concerned about getting an apology than
anything else.)

<Abi:    kono ABI-HIME-sama o MAkikonda koto da.>
Abi: have been dragged into a conflict between two lowly Half-Youkai.
