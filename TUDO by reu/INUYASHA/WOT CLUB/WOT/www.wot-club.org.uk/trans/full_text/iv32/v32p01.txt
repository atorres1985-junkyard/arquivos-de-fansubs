Although scene descriptions are provided, it is not nearly the same as
seeing it for yourself. If you enjoy the series, I would strongly
recommend buying the 'tankoubon' (collected version, each about 180
pages or 10 chapters long, costing 410 yen) when they become available
- the first was released on 18th April 1997, and the first 21 are now
available.

Warning: These translations will occationally include strong language,
as well as violence, though this is only when it is present in the
original Japanese version.

<shikigami:    IMAda MUNE no ANA mo fusagaranu mama, kono kata o MUSHIBAmi TSUZUkete iru.>

<Kagome:    dattara...>
Kagome: In which case...

3
[View of the two girls.]
<shikigami#1:    FUrete kudasareba ii.>

<shikigami#2:    sore de SHOUKI wa JOUKAsareru.>
shikigami#2: That will purify the miasma.

Kagome: .oO(I'll take a look.).

4
[Kagome pulls back Kikyou's kimono somewhat - the large deep scar in
Kikyou's chest can clearly be seen, with miasma leaking out.]
Kagome: !

5
[Closeup of Kagome, looks a bit sad.]
<Kagome:    hidoi...>
Kagome: .oO(How terrible...).
<Kagome:    kawaisou...>
Kagome: .oO(I feel sorry for her...).

[In the darkness, Kagome notices something shining up above her.]
Fx light: sparkl... <Kira...>

[Kagome reaches out for it.]
<Kagome:    nani...?>
Kagome: .oO(What...?).

3
[Closeup of it becoming more organised, into a clump.]
Fx bright mist: swirl... <Shuru>

4
[It comes to collect in Kagome's hand, quite bright against the gloom of the
miasma around her.]
Fx soil: sksh... <Sara Sara Sara>

(    This is the same sound effect as when the two shikigami poured the soil
into the pool two chapters ago.)

5
[Closeup of Kagome looking surprised.]
<Kagome:    kore wa...?>
Kagome: .oO(This is...?).

6
[Up out of the water, the two shikigami can just about be seen.]

<shikigami#2:    IMA... anata no TE ga JOUKAshimashita.>

[Closeup of Kagome, with her eyes open.]
<Kagome:    a...?>

[Closeup of Kikyou's face.]
Fx Kikyou: *twitch* <Piku>



Page 12
1
[Kagome looks around her in surprise. The water is completely clean and
light is shining strong down through the water. Nice scene.]
Fx water: shh... <Sa--->
<Kagome:    a...>
Kagome: .oO(Ah...).

2
[Closeup of Kagome.]
<Kagome:    MIZU ga... KIREI ni natta...>

Kagome: .oO(Thank... goodness...).
Fx Kagome: glub... <Gobo...>

4
[Kagome seems to have fallen unconscious. However, Kikyou is awake, with her
usual poker-face.]
Kikyou: ......



Page 13
1
[Time passes. View of the trees around the pool.]
Fx leaves: rustle... <Sawa...>

2
[Closeup of Kagome waking up, with water on her face.]
<Kagome:    u...>
Kagome: Uh...

3
[Kagome is lying beside the pool by herself.]
Fx water: shh... <Za--...>
Kagome: !

4
[Kagome starts to sit up. Kikyou is standing a short distance away with her
back to Kagome, with the two girl shikigami around her.]
Fx leaves: rustle... <Zawa...>

5
[Closeup of Kagome.]
<Kagome:    KIKYOU!>
Kagome: Kikyou!

6
[Kikyou turns around to look.]



Page 14
1
[Closeup of Kikyou glancing back at Kagome.]
<Kikyou:    naze... TASUketa?>
Kikyou: Why... did you save me?

2
[Closeup of Kagome looking a bit surprised.]
<Kagome:    e...!?>
Kagome: Eh...!?

3
[Kagome is now standing up, and adresses Kikyou.]
<Kagome:    tte...>
Kagome: Erm...
<Kagome:    datte, anata ga atashi o YOnda n-ja nai no!?>
Kagome: But, weren't you the one who called me here!?

4
[Closeup of Kikyou.]
<Kikyou:    ERAbeta hazu da.>
Kikyou: You should have made a choice though.
<Kikyou:    SUKUu ka, SUKUwanai ka.>
Kikyou: Whether to save me or not.



Page 15
1
[Kagome looks at Kikyou, a bit confused.]
<Kagome:    ano nee...>
Kagome: Umm, you know...
<Kagome:    ERAbu to ka sou iu HANASHI ja nai desho.>
Kagome: It's not a question of making a choice, is it.

2
[Closeup of Kagome.]
<Kagome:    ME no MAE ni TASUkarisou na HITO ga ite,>
Kagome: There was a person right in front of me who I could save,
<Kagome:    WATASHI shika TASUkeru koto ga dekinai tte Iwaretara,>
Kagome: and was told that I was the only person who could save you,
<Kagome:    TASUkeru ni KImatte-ru ja nai.>
Kagome: of course I would save you.

3
[Closeup of Kikyou, poker-faced.]
Kikyou: ......
<Kikyou:    naraba...>
Kikyou: In which case...



Page 16
1
[Kikyou turns to look away from Kagome.]
<Kikyou:    REI wa Iwanai.>
Kikyou: I won't thank you.
<Kikyou:    omae ga KImeta koto da.>
Kikyou: It was your choice.

(    I think what Kikyou means is that since Kagome "didn't go to the effort" of
making a choice, she won't thank Kagome for saving her.)

2
[Closeup of Kagome looking rather taken aback.]
<Kagome:    haa!?>
Kagome: .oO(Huh!?).

3
[Kagome has a sort of depressed, sort of like she's not very surprised.]
<Kagome:    nanka mou...>
Kagome: .oO(It seems she's already...).
<Kagome:    HON_TOU ni SUNAO ja nai n-dakara...>
Kagome: .oO(as direct as she ever was...).
Fx Kagome: *si-i-i-gh* <fu---->

(    This line of Kagome's is also a bit ambiguous. One meaning is that for
someone who was just saved from dying, Kikyou is (already) back to her
usual forceful self. The other is that when Kikyou said "I won't thank
you", that wasn't her true feelings.)

4
[Closeup of Kikyou as she's walking away.]
<Kikyou:    mamonaku INUYASHA ga KUru.>
Kikyou: Inuyasha will be arriving soon.
<Kikyou:    omae o Otte...>
Kikyou: Coming for you...

5
[Kagome watches Kikyou walk off, seeming a bit surprised.]
<Kagome:    e...>
Kagome: Eh...
Fx Kikyou: *walk over ground* <Saku...>



Page 17
1
[Closeup of Kagome, looking a bit annoyed.]
<Kagome:    chotto... doko Iku no!?>
Kagome: Hey... Where are you going!?
<Kagome:    INUYASHA ni Atte ikanai no?>
Kagome: Aren't you going to meet with Inuyasha?

2
[Kikyou turns to glance back at Kagome.]
<Kikyou:    WATASHI wa mou shibaraku MI o KAKUsu.>
Kikyou: I will be hiding myself for a bit longer.
<Kikyou:    CHIKARA o takuwaneeba naranai.>
Kikyou: I have to build up my power.

3
[Drawing of Inuyasha (only one in the entire chapter) with Kagome overlaid.]
<Kagome:    INUYASHA wa...>
Kagome: .oO(Inuyasha...).

4
[Continuation of same frame.]
<Kagome:    KIKYOU ni AItagatte iru no yo.>
Kagome: .oO(wants to see Kikyou.).

5
[Long view of Kagome from above.]
<Kagome:    kuyashii kedo...>
Kagome: .oO(It's annoying, but...).



Page 18
1
[Scene change to where Kikyou is walking through the forest with the two
girl Shikigami.]
<Kikyou:    kagome no KOKORO ni wa,>
Kikyou: .oO(In Kagome's heart,).
<Kikyou:    nan no MAYOi mo nakatta.>
Kikyou: .oO(there wasn't any doubt.).

2
[Closeup of Kikyou putting a hand to her chest.]
<Kikyou:    MAYOi ga areba,>
Kikyou: .oO(If she had doubted,).
<Kikyou:    kono MUNE no ANA wa Umaranakatta.>
Kikyou: .oO(the hole in my chest wouldn't have been filled.).

3
[Closeup of Kikyou, looking a bit troubled.]
<Kikyou:    mada atatakai.>
Kikyou: .oO(It's still warm.).
