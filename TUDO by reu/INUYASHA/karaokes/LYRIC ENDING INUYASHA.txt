tsuyogaru koto dake shiri-sugite-ita watashi
I've known all too well about pretending to be strong


dakedo ano toki kara mayoi wa kieta yo
But since then, my doubts have vanished


misetai to omou mono ga kitto atte
There's definitely things I want to show you


kikasetai kotoba mo takusan aru
And so many words I want to hear


egao nakigao mo zenbu mite hoshikute
I want to see all sides of you, when you laugh and cry


matte-iru watashi wa yamete
So I'll stop waiting


CHANSU wo tsukamu yo
and seize my chance


anata no koto wo omou
I think of you


sore dake de kokoro ga
and I feel like that alone is enough



tsuyoku nareru ki ga suru yo
to make my heart grow stronger


hakanai omoi zutto
I always, always wish


donna toki demo negau yo
that these fleeting thoughts


anata ni todoku you ni to...
would reach you...
