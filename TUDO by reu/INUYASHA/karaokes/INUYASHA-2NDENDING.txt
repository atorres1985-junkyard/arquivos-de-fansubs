boku-tachi wa ikiru hodo ni
As we live on


nakushite'ku sukoshi zutsu
we lose a little bit more


shinjite'ru hikari motome
Believing (in you?), now I begin my journey with you


arukidasu kimi to ima
in search of the light



fukai fukai mori no oku ni ima mo kitto
I'm sure that the heart I left behind


okizari ni shita kokoro kakushite'ru yo
still lies hidden in the heart of the deep, deep forest


toki no RIZUMU wo shireba
If we can find the rhythm of time


mo ichido toberu darou
we can fly once again



boku-tachi wa samayoi nagara
We live our lives



ikite yuku doko made mo
wandering to the ends of the earth



shinjite'ru hikari motome
Believing (in you?), now I begin my journey with you



arukidasu kimi to ima
in search of the light
