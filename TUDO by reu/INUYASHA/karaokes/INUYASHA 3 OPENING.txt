kokoro no naka no
the city

jiorama no machi wa
in the georama of the heart

kibou no hikari de 
is sparkling with

kirameite iru
the light of hope

kagerou no hane de
the dream that flew up

habataita yume wa
with the wings of an ephemera

kimi to boku to no sagashimono
is something that we search for

shinjitsu wa itsumo
the truth is always

hitomi ni hisonde iru aoku
hiding in the eyes bluely

bokura wa doko made yukou
where shall we go up to

futari no mirai ima sasuratte
our future roams around now

bokura wa tabi o tsuzukeru
and we continue with our journey

eien no arika
the place of eternity

owari nai yume
and endless dream

kono te o hanasazu oikakete ikitai
I want to chase after it without letting go of this hand

zutto
forever
