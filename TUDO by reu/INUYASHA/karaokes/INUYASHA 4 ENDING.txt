Ikutsu namida o nagashitara
If there were many tears falling down

every heart sunao ni nareru darou
every heart would become gentle

Dare ni omoi tsutaetara
If everybody expresses what they think

every heart kokoro mita sareru no darou
Every heart can be satisfied

nagai nagai yoru ni obieteita
I was frightened by the neverending night,

Tooi hoshi ni inotteta
So I prayed to the distant stars.

meguru meguru toki no naka de
In endlessly repeating time

Bokutachi wa ai o sagashiteiru
We were searching for love

Tsuyoku tsuyoku naritai kara
Because we wanted to become stronger

kyou mo takaisora miageteiru
We look up to the faraway sky

meguru meguru toki no naka de
In endlessly repeating time

boku tachi wa ikite nanika wo shiru
We know why we are living

toki ni warai shugoshi naite
We go through the nighttime laughing

kyou mo mada 
Both of us are mourning
