Goku: Let's do it, Kuririn! Don't lose!
Kuririn: Okay!
Tenshin: Hey, Chauzu. Take a look.
Chauzu: He's the one from...
Tenshin: That's right. He's the one.
         I didn't think we'd meet up here...
         This is going to be interesting.
Judge: We will now start the matches in block 1.
       Will the first 2 fighters please come forward?
Yamucha: I'd better make sure I don't lose this easily.
Goku: Good luck, Yamucha-{\i1}san{\i0}!
Oolong: The preliminary matches should be starting soon.
Bulma: I hope they'll do alright.
Pu-erh: Don't worry.\NAll of them will advance.
Bulma: I hope so...
???: Young fool...!
     What?!
Yamucha: Boards don't hit back.
???: You too. You'll lose before you have a chance to hit back too.
     So, please begin!
Tenshin: Let's take a good look at what this Turtle Hermit is all about.
???: Die!
Judge: Number 1 fainted!\NNumber 2 wins!
Goku: Wow! You must've trained pretty hard.
Yamucha: Not really...
Chauzu: What do you think, Ten?
Yamucha: Looks like Kuririn is going to fight.
Goku: Let's go.
Judge: Number 63!\NIs fighter 63 here?
Kuririn: What?
Goku: He's huge!
Giant: You're my opponent?
Kuririn: A-Ah, yep!
Giant: What a laugh! Hey kid! If you don't want to die, go home and do some fingerpainting instead!
Yamucha: I remeber! He's...!
Goku: Do you know him, Yamucha?
Yamucha: Anton the Great. He's a former pro wrestling champion.
Goku: Is he strong?
Yamucha: Yes, he was so strong that he ran out of opponents.
         I heard he was tearing up the underground wrestling circuit.
Judge: We would like to begin the match right away.
       Start!
Kuririn: Please come at me anytime you want.
Giant: Sassy kid! You're just a little squirt!
Kuririn: Squirt...?
Giant: I'll squash you flat!
Yamucha: Be careful, Kuririn!\NYou're lost if he catches you!
ALL: Oh no...!
Giant: I'll crush you like this!
Yamucha: His grip has a force of 400 kilos!\NEnough to crush boulders!
Goku: Kuririn!
Kuririn: Not really...
         This measly amount of pressure won't affect me.
Giant: What?
       Ow...!
       You rotten kid...!
ALL: Wow...!
Kuririn: The decision?
Judge: Number 63, out of bounds!\NNumber 62 wins!
Goku: Wow! You've become so strong.\NI can't even compare you to 3 years ago.
Yamucha: Umm, that was magnificent.
Kuririn: It's too easy to be impressed.\NThis is just the beginning.
Tenshin: What a sorry bunch to be pleased with such pretty technique.
Yamucha: What did you say?
Goku: Hey! You're...
Kuririn: They're disciples of an old geezer called\NCrane Hermit who's a rival of Turtle Hermit.
Goku: I remember!
      You guys were the ones that tricked Inoshikacho.
Kuririn: You know them, Goku?
Tenshin: Right. I spared his life.\NAfter all, I could have finished him off.
Yamucha: What does that mean?
Tenshin: It means no one can beat me.
         You're all lucky you didn't have to fight me in the preliminary round.
Yamucha: What?!
Kuririn: W-What's this guy?\NHe's strange.
Chauzu: Shortly!
Kuririn: What! What about you!
Chauzu: Shortly!
Kuririn: Why you...!
Tenshin: Stop it Chauzu. We're going to beat these guys up eventually.
         Although, that's only if they manage to advance.
Yamucha: Disappear. Before you get blasted away.
Tenshin: You're full of bravado. But in that last match, you missed your opponent's weak spot by 1 centimeter.
Yamucha: I did that on purpose.\NI don't want to kill anyone.
         Although if I were fighting someone like you, I wouldn't hold back.
Tenshin: How amusing. Do you want to fight now...?
         Right here!
Yamucha: It's just a matter of time before I make you swallow your arrogant words.
Goku: Don't, Yamucha!
Yamucha: Don't stop me, Goku.\NI can't stand his type!
Jackie: Now, now! You boys!
        You didn't come to the tournament to cause trouble.
        That could get you disqualified.
Tenshin: Who's this geezer?
Yamucha: Geezer?
         He's the last tournament winner, Jackie Chun.
Tenshin: That's right. You guys entered the last time too.
         If you let someone this decrepit beat you,\NI won't have to bother myself fighting you.
Yamucha: What did you say?
Tenshin: Well... Do the best you can.\NLet's go Chauzu.
Kuririn: Why that...!
         He'd be world champion at offensiveness!
Bulma: Look! It's that rotten geezer, Crane Hermit.
Crane: Where did that fool Turtle Hermit go?
Bulma: I don't kow! Probably the toilet.
Crane: Maybe not. Maybe he went home because he didn't want to see his disciples lose.
Bulma: What did you say?
Crane: By the way, are you Turtle Hermit's little lady?
Bulma: I am not!\NDon't be rude!
       Idiot!
Crane: But you sure have nice ones.
       How about you living with me?\NIt'll be a good life.
Bulma: W-With the likes of you?\NGet away from me!
Crane: Oh-oh-oh....!
Crane: What about you! I'll take good care of you.
       I'll take good care of you...
       So?
Lunch: Geezer! I've had enough!
Grane: Tell Turtle Hermit! Tell him not to forget the preparations for his disciples' funeral.
Judge: Block 3, number 99 and 100.\NPlease come forward.
Tenshin: It's my turn.
Chauzu: Good luck, Ten-{\i1}san{\i0}!
???: Look! He's up!
Kuririn: Guys like that are all talk.
         Let's laugh at him if he loses.
Goku: No. He's awesome.
Kuririn: Really?
Yamucha: Goku, what happened between you and him anyway?
         Have you fought him?
Goku: Yes, just a little.
Kuririn: Show off!
monk: What's that? He's just a mound of fat.
fat: What?!
     Say that again!
monk: Got a problem?
fat: I'll kill you!
monk: Try it!
      I-Impossible! No effect...?
Yamucha: That sumo wrestler is pretty good.
Jackie: Right. Opponents like that arre fairly difficult to fight.
        Ordinary techniques won't have any effect.
Judge: A-And so...
       Start the match!
       Faint! Number 99 wins!
???: Bring a stretcher!
???2: W-What's going on?
???3: Did you do something?
Yamucha: Four punches...
Kuririn: And 2 kicks.
Goku: He's good!
Kururin: But he's not unbelievably good.
Tenshin: Idiot! I'm not showing everything I have in the preliminaries.
Judge: Block 1, number 27 and 28.
Goku: It's my turn.
Goku: One, two...
Kuririn: It's finally Goku's turn.
Yamucha: Let's watch this carefully.
Jackie: I'm looking forward to seeing how much Goku has progressed.
Kuririn: That's Goku's opponent?\NHe doesn't look very strong.
Yamucha: Right. I feel a little sorry for him.
         He got Goku right at the beginning.
Black: My, my... What a cute little opponent.
Jackie: I've seen him before...
Tiger: Hey... Isn't that King Chapa?
???: R-Right...
Jackie: That's right!\NThat's King Chapa!
Yamucha: K-King Chapa? That's him?
         Goku drew a formidable opponent...!
Kuririn: Who's King Chapa?
Yamucha: He's supposed to be an amazing fighter.
Jackie: Yep. He wasn't touched by a single opponent the last time he entered this tournament.
        And he won it all.
Yamucha: T-This isn't good. But that's Goku up there.
         If he takes his time he might be alright.
Judge: So, start the match!
Black: Don't worry. I won't kill you.
Goku: Thank you.
Narrator: A tournament that truly has the force of a gale.
          What will be the outcome of this match between Goku and King Chapa?
