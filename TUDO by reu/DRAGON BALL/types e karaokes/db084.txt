Captain: Hard starboard!\NHard starboard!
ALL: What is it?
All: It's a kid.

              the World Championship Martial Arts Tournament will be held.

Yamucha: We're finally here.
Pu-erh: You'll win for sure this time, Yamucha-sama!
Kuririn: Don't bet on it.\NYou'll have to get past me.
Yamucha: Sure. I'll show you the results of my 3 years of training.
Bulma: You both say that now, but have\Nyou forgotten about Son-{\i1}kun{\i0}?
Oolong: And that old man named Jackie Chun?
Lunch: I feel like hijacking when I ride on airplanes!
Turtle: Please control the urge, Lunch-{\i1}san{\i0}.
Lady: Your seatbelt, Sir.
Jackie: Stewardess-{\i1}san{\i0}?
        I have to poop.
Lady: I'm sorry but we'll be landing very soon.
      Please bear it a little longer.
Jackie: R-Roger. Hurry and land.
Kuririn: Muten Roshi-{\i1}sama{\i0}?\NPlease don't embarrass us.
Yamucha: Pretend we're strangers.
Goku:I'm hungry!
     Are you guys hungry too?
     Eat lots. There's more.
     What's wrong?
     This is so good.
     Time out!
Oolong: He's taking so long! How long\Nis he going to stay in there?
Kuririn: Admission for entrants will be over!
Jackie: Thanks for waiting. I just couldn't get the poop to come out.
Bulma: Don't say that so loudly!
???: Hurry!
Turtle: I'm sorry...
Kuririn: Will you hurry to the tournament site please?
Kuririn: This brings back memories!\NThis day has finally come again.
Yamucha: Yep!
Jackie: Go enter yourselves.
??? : Yamucha-{\i1}san{\i0} and Kuririn-{\i1}san{\i0} ?
Jackie: Has anyone named Son Goku entered yet?
???: The runner-up in the last tournament? Let's see...
     It doesn't seem that he's arrived yet.
Jackie: Not yet?
Kuririn: What could he be doing?
Oolong: If he takes too much time,\Nthey'll close admissions.
Jackie: Impossible boy. He couldn't have forgotten, could he?
Yamucha: Time's running out.
Bulma: He'll come! He was looking forward to this tournament.
Oolong: He's always doing things like this!
Lunch: The prize is 500,000 zeni, huh?\NI think I'll enter too.
Turtle: You can't. They don't let you use weapons in this tournament.
Jackie: That's right! I forgot!
Jackie: Will you write in the name, Jackie Chun?
???: Jackie Chun was the winnder of the last tournament!
???: Are you saying...?
Jackie: See?
???: You are...!
Jackie: But please keep it a secret.
???: Jackie Chun-{\i1}sama{\i0}...
Bulma: Only 5 more minutes!
Oolong: He failed.
Kuririn: Where were you, Sir?
Jackie: The toilet.
Turtle: Hermit-{\i1}sama{\i0}, I'm suprised\Nyour bowets move that much. 
Jackie: I didn't this time!
Grane: Why, if it isn't the Turtle Hermit.
Jackie: Oh, it's you Grane Hermit.\NYou're still alive?
Grane: Offensive as usual, I see.
Bulma: I don't like him...
Grane: I heard this silly rumor that your disciples\Ndid quite well at the last tournament.
Jackie: What about it?
Grane: This tournament has gone downhill.\NBut this time...
       I entered my disciples to show everyone\Nwhat real martial arts is.
Grane: Too bad. One of my disciples will win. Don't you think you should go home before you embarrass yourselves?
Jackie: Is that supposed to be a joke?
        As usual, you have no style.
Grane: What! You baid-headed...!
Jackie: Shut up! You half-baid...!
Grane: Let's go! We can't waste time with these fools!
       I'm looking forward to this.
Yamucha: Who was that rotten old man?
Jackie: He's the Crane Hermit, an arch rival!
Oolong: Never mind that! There's only 1 minute left!
Turtle: Goku-{\i1}san{\i0}!
Yamucha: We have no choice.\NPu-erh, turn yourself into Goku so at least he'll be entered.
Lunch: Wait! Here he comes!
Goku: Hey everyone!
Yamucha: It's Goku!
Goku: It's been a while!
      Were you all okay?
Bulma: Of course!
Goku: I'm fine too!
Jackie: Son Goku has arrived.\NPlease take care of him.
???: O-Okay.
Bulma: Why are you so filthy?
Goku: You're Bulma?
Yamucha: Hey Goku!\NYou've grown quite a bit.
Goku: Think so?
Kuririn: Rats...! I grew quite a bit too!
Jackie: Hey Goku! You gave us a scare!\NWhere's the {\i1}Kinto Un{\i0}?
Goku: But you told me not to use it so I could train. That's why...
Jackie: That's right. I did.
Oolong: Did you actually swim here?
Goku: That's right.\NFrom this place called Yahhoy.
Yamucha: Y-Yahhoy?
Bulma: Yahhoy's on the exact opposite side of the world.
Oolong: What were you thinkin?
Jackie: In any case, everyone's entered now so shall we all go eat?
Goku: Eat?
Jackie: The fighting should start tomorrow.
        So as a pre-celebration, I'll treat you to whatever you all want.
        You can't fight a war on an empty stomach.
Kuririn: Great!
Goku: Okay! I'm going to eat!
Jackie: I-I think it might be better not to eat so much before...
        Oh no...!
Goku: - I'm stuffed!
Kuririn: - I can't eat another bite.
Shop owner: What did you say?\NYou don't have enough money?
Jackie: Please wait another 2 or 3 days.\NThen I'll have 500,000 zeni.
        Wait until then, okay?
        I'm telling the truth!
Shop owner: Alright.
Goku: Kuririn, was the old man's training tough?
Kuririn: It was exactly the same as before.
         Working in the fields, delivering milk and...
         But at the end we trained by carrying a shell that weighed 100 kilograms!
Goku: A hundred? Wow!
Jackie: Sorry about that.'
Turtle: What happened?\NYou don't look good.
        Did you have to go to the toilet again?
Jackie: Be quiet!\NYou talk too much!
        It doesn't matter.
        Let's go back to the hotel and watch some dirty videos...
        I mean, play some cards and relax.
Oolong: Watch out for the old maid!
Lunch: Whats's this?
Turtle: The old maid!
Lunch: Which one?
Turtle: Second from the left.
Lunch: Take it.
Pu-erh: I'm out!
???: I'm out!
Oolong: Yahoo! I'm out!
Goku: Which one should I take?
Jackie: Hurry and take one!'
Goku: I'll take this one.
      I'm out!
Oolong: The greezer got stuck with the old maid.
Bulma: Good night!
Goku&Jackie: - Good night!\N- Good night!
Jackie: Hi!
        It's dangerous for 2 young girls to sleep alone so I'll be your bodyguard...
        Sorry!
        Think I'll go to bed.
Kuririn: Huh? Yamucha-{\i1}san{\i0}!
Yamucha: I can't sleep either.
Kuririn: Let's give it our best from tomorrow.
Yamucha: Right!
swimmer: Those 3 did really well at the last tournament.
???: They've entered again?
     They'll be tough.
Kuririn: There's a lot more entrants than the last time.
Goku: I like this outfit the best.
Yamucha: So, do you think Goku got a lot stronger in these 3 years?
Kuririn: He doesn't look like it...
Bulma: All of you have to make it past the preliminary rounds.
Pu-erh: Good luck!
Jackei: Remember. Bring out everything you've learned in the past 3 years.
Announcement: We will begin the preliminary rounds.
              All entrants please enter the arena.
Pu-erh: Where's Muten Roshi-{\i1}sama{\i0} ?
Oolong: He was here a minute ago.
Bulma: Leave him. He probably went to the toilet again.
black: Hey! Isn't that old man Jackie Chun?
Bear: That's right.\NHe won the last tournament.
Goku: Old-timer!
Jackie: It's been a while.\NWe meet again.
Goku: You came too?
Jackie: Yep, to see you.
Goku: You did? I hope I can beat you this time.
Jackie: You must have trained even more.
        I'll look forward to it.
        No way! I have my pride as Muten Roshi.
        I won't lose. I've secretly trained too.
Monk: Thank you all for gathering for the 22nd Tenkaichi Tournament.
      As you know, because of the increase in participants,
      the tournament will be held every 3 years.
      We actually have 182 entrants this time.
      Only 8 will be allowed to enter the actual tournament.
      It will be a difficult battle indeed...
Narrator: The battle finally begins!
